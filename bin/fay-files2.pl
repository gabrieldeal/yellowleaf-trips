Inner Constance (USGS The Brothers and Mt Deception) - July 18-19, 2000

Had the usual hassles getting a permit to camp in the Lake Constance area -
hours on the phone getting a reservation from the Wilderness Center.  Then
no ranger at the Dosewalips RS, where the permit is required to be picked
up, a not unusual occurrence during the week.  Finally gave up and wrote
out my own permit with the reservation number written on it. Meanwhile,
precious time lost. They don\'t make it easy to follow the rules.
The Trail to Lake Constance was as bad as I remembered from two years ago
when I climbed Mt Constance. Went about 3/4 mile beyond the lake into
Avalanche Canyon to set up camp on one of the rare flat snowfree areas. 
Had the whole place to myself.  After a short rest I set out to climb Pk
7022 on the right side of the canyon.  This is rated class 2 by the
Climbers Guide.  I think they underrate it a bit.  Of course, I got into
the wrong gully and had an interesting traverse back into the right one. 
But even so, there was a 30 ft or so step in that gully that I would rate
at least class 3. Above this was pleasant class 2 scrambling and I arrived
on the summit at 7:00 PM.  Enjoyed beautiful views in the warm, sunny
weather of all the surrounding peaks.  Got back to camp at 9:00 in time to
eat dinner before it was completely dark.

Started up Avalanche Canyon (on snow the whole way) the next morning at
6:00 AM intending to climb Inner Constance by Route 2 in the Climber\'s
Guide. Turned left once past the Thumb and climbed into the snow basin
between the Thumb and Inner Constance. From here I exited the snow onto
rock and followed a ledge (2 tricky narrow sections) that diagonaled right
to an upper snow slope.  I missed the couloir of route 2 that led to the
notch on the east side of the summit block and ended up continuing up snow
and then rock to the south ridge just north of the Pyramid. This put me on
the last part of Route I. However, the ridge was fun scrambling all the way
to the base of the imposing summit block.  A direct approach from here is
class 4, but I elected for the easier ledge that traverses across the south
face to the east ridge and the easy scramble of Route 2 to the summit,
which I reached at 9:40.  My view toward the north of Warrior and Constance
came and went as the valley fog lifted over the ridge. But the views to the
south were spectacular.

 I retraced my steps back along the ridge, and since it was still early,
opted for an attempt on the Pyramid. This entailed dropping down the west
side of the ridge below cliffs, then climbing back up to the saddle on the
north side of the Pyramid.  An easy scramble led to the base of the summit
rocks. The Pyramid is rated class 3 but again I question it.  I was able to
make my way (with the help of a rope) to what I thought was the summit only
to find an impassable 20 ft deep cleft between me and another point that
appeared slightly higher.  I found a way into the cleft from below, but try
as I might I could not find a reasonable way, given my equipment and
ability, to the top of the second point.  If this is indeed the summit, I
would rate it low class 5, but then again, someone with a longer reach than
mine might not have had the same difficulty.

I retraced my steps once again, back to the ridge and down the initial snow
slopes.  But I was able to locate the snow chute of Route 2a for the
descent and so avoided the tricky rock ledge back to the Thumb basin.  Fast
glissades led back to Avalanche Canyon and camp at 3:30.  Just before
reaching my tent, I passed the camp of John Roper and friend and spent a
pleasant half hour in conversation.  He was climbing Mt Constance the next
day.  It was nice to meet him after reading about his exploits for years.
I had time to relax and rest before the heading down the dreaded trail at
5:15 and reaching the car at 8:00, well before dark.  You do not want to
descend the Lake Constance trail in the dark.

Mt Fernow and Ice Lakes (USGS Holden, Pinnacle Mtn) - October 4-7, 2000
I started up the Entiat River Trail about noon with a forecast of four
sunny days ahead.  My main objective was Mt Fernow but I also hoped to
climb Buckskin and Tinpan Mtns and then return via Ice lakes. I made it to
camp in the meadow just past the Cool Cr Trail junction, about 13 1/2 miles
up the trail at 6:30.

The next day I started up Mt Fernow at 8:30 by first following the Entiat
River Trail to its end in the basin below Mt Maude and Seven Fingered Jack
and then heading NW up steep meadows to a rock step.  After working my way
through the rocky terrain on ledges and gullies, I emerged into a lovely
upper basin of heather, creeks and slabby rock at 7000 ft.  This was very
pleasant terrain to wander through.  Above this was talus and snow, which I
avoided as much as possible as it was very icy, and another rock step
easily breached by a short chimney.  Then easy scree led to the east ridge
at 8700 ft. A traverse SW on ledges bypassed a subsidiary summit and
crossed several notches before dropping slightly to a broad rocky gully
directly below the summit.  This gully was a fairly serious but fun class 3
scramble to the 9249 ft summit of Mt Fernow, which I reached at 1:00. I
quickly enjoyed the magnificent views, particularly Seven Fingered Jack and
the North Face of Mt Maude and signed the register as the icy wind forced
me to eat my lunch a short ways back down in a protected spot.
I retraced my steps back to the east ridge, then stayed on the ridge or its
south side, passing through some lovely alpine larch benches, all the way
to the saddle below Pt 7552.  I naively thought I could traverse the ridge
all the way to Buckskin Mtn but it soon became apparent that was not
possible, at least not in any reasonable length of time. The cliffs of Pt
7552 were in the way. I would have to descend all the way back down to the
river and climb back up to Buckskin from there.  No time left to try that
this day so I just headed back to camp at 5:00.

The days were warm and pleasant in the sun, but both nights in Entiat
Meadows were frigid, I would guess the mid 20\'s, and I doubt the daytime
temperature (in the shade) got much above freezing, as a water bottle
frozen the previous night and left in the tent did not thaw out during the
day.

The next day I got an early start up Buckskin at 6:45.  Buckskin was
directly above my campsite so I just headed uphill.  I had only gone a few
hundred feet when I came across a good trail not marked on any of my maps.
I followed this trail as it switchbacked up alongside a gully then crossed
at about 6700 ft and traversed up to the ridge between Buckskin and Tinpan
at 6900 ft.  Here was an old sign identifying the trail as the Wilson
Creek Trail.  I later discovered this to be an old abandoned trail. 
Abandoned or not someone has been maintaining it, as some blowdowns had
been recently cleared and it was in very good shape.

Since the trail had led me away from Buckskin, I decided to climb Tinpan
first. From the trail I just followed the ridge east to the summit of
Tinpan at 9:00. On this ridge were some absolutely gorgeous groves of
golden alpine larches backlit by the morning sun. Back at the trail an hour
later, I then followed the ridge west to the summit of Buckskin at 11:30. 
Buckskin proved to be more of a scramble than Tinpan, involving traversing
below the ridge and crossing several gullies near the top. I retraced my
steps on the ridge until past the scramble portion, then descended directly
downhill to intersect the trail lower down. Camp was reached at 1:00.
I still wanted to get to Ice Lakes today so I really had to move. I broke
camp after a quick lunch and headed back up the Entiat River trail at
2:00.   I was following the Ice Lakes High Route as described in Crowder
and Tabor\'s Routes and Rocks (this book, out of print, is a real treasure).
About a half mile farther up trail, in a large meadow, I crossed the Entiat
River and diagonalled upstream to a broad gully.  This gully gave access to
a large upper talus basin at about 7000 ft.  The only hard part was
bypassing a frozen waterfall on the right up a very steep wooded rib.  Back
in the gully, the creek was rimmed with ice, but that was easily avoided to
the side.  This was a north facing slope where the sun never reached this
time of year and the ice didn\'t melt.  Near the top of the talus basin was
a snow slope leading to the low point in the ridge above Ice Lake.  The
snow was so hard as to almost qualify as technical ice and though I carried
both ice axe and crampons I had no desire to tackle it with a full
overnight pack on.  So I bypassed the snow on the left on tedious but much
safer scree and came out on the ridge about 300 ft above the saddle. This
put me only a couple of hundred feet below the summit of North Spectacle
Butte.  Even though I was running out of time, there was no way I was going
to be that close to a summit and not go for it.  So I dropped my pack and
ran up to the easy summit at 5:20. Back to my pack at 5:30 and then an easy
descent down pumice slopes to the beautiful lower Ice Lake at 6:10. I set
up my tent in a great campsite near the outlet stream.

It was actually warmer at Ice Lake than in the Entiat valley even though I
was camped 1800 ft higher and the next morning I actually woke up to sun on
my tent! Ice Lakes has to be one of the most beautiful places in the
Cascades, particularly in the fall.  The contrast of the golden larches
rimming the lake to the deep blue-green of the water was positively
stunning.  I spent the morning of my last day taking a leisurely hike up to
the upper lake and just basking in the sun of my lovely campsite.  Too soon
it was time to leave.  I still had 14 miles back to the trailhead.  I left
at noon. Since I hadn\'t come up the Ice Lakes Trail, I had a little trouble
locating where it left the lake, but I soon picked it up in the meadow
below. The Entiat trail was reached at 3:00 and the trailhead at 6:15. 

Estimated total mileage for the trip 50, total elevation gain 15,400 ft.

McCartney Peak (USGS Mt Angeles, McCartney Pk, Maiden Pk, Wellesley Pk) -
After the long drive, stopping for my camping permit at the Wilderness
Center in Port Angeles, and eating lunch at the trailhead at Obstruction
Point (6100 ft), it was 1:30 pm before I started on the trail to Grand
Valley. The magnificent views along the first mile and half of trail made
this almost flat, easy section a real treat. When I reached the 6450 ft
saddle where the trail begins to descend into Grand Valley, I stayed on the
ridge, following a way trail S.  This way trail was easily followed as it
climbed up and down along the crest, with only a few scramble moves, until
it hit the narrow ridge S of Pt 6580. Here an unpleasant descent down a
loose gully was followed by a traverse under cliffs and a climb back up to
the ridge at the saddle just N of Moose Pt.
 
After a side trip to the broad summit of Moose, I continued along the easy
ridge to the 5920 ft saddle to the south. Here I made a long and unpleasant
descending traverse S on steep scree and heather to a nice campsite on a
knoll (5450 ft) above the Lillian River.  This camp was directly below the
saddle between Grandview Pk (6701) and Pt 6381. It had taken 4 hours and,
even though I was now some 650 ft below my starting point at the TH, 1450
ft of elevation gain to get here. The bugs had not been bad hiking, but
once stopped they came out in force.  To escape them, after dinner I took a
quick evening walk up Pt 6381, making the round trip in 1:10 hr, then
turning in for the night.
 
The next morning I was on my way by 8:00. A pleasant hike up meadows and
talus past a waterfall, then easy snowslopes to the saddle above and a
simple scramble along the S ridge put me on the summit of McCartney at
9:30.  After a half hour to enjoy the views and leave a register where
there was none,  I continued on my way following the ridge S and E to Pt
6728. I stayed here long enough to paint a watercolor sketch of Mt Olympus,
then quickly descended back to camp for lunch.
 
For the trip out I decided on a different route than the one I had taken
in. I climbed up to the saddle directly E of camp, then went north along
the ridge to Grandview. From here a good way trail led down to Grand Pass
where the Grand Valley Trail led down, down, down to Moose Lake, only to
then climb up, up, up back to Obstruction Point. Grand total for the trip
with all the ups and downs, 17 miles and 7700 ft gain. Fay Pullen, 7/31-
8/1, 2002.
 
 
Snowfield Peak (USGS Diablo Dam, Ross Dam) - What a beautiful mountain this
turned out to be, although it was a bit of a pain getting there. When Linda
and I stopped in Marblemount for our permit, we discovered only one other
party signed out for the area, a Marty LaFare and friend, so we figured we
would have a certain amount of solitude. We started up the Pyramid Lake
trail just before noon. We had postponed our trip by a day to let a storm
pass and the weather was now improving rapidly.  It was still rather cool,
which made for pleasant hiking up the steep trail and kept the bugs at bay,
at least for a while. 
 
At the lake we picked up the climber\'s trail on the right shore and
followed it very steeply to the ridge. This "trail" was much better than I
had expected and was easily followed to this point, where we had our first
partial views of impressive Pyramid Peak. The trail now wandered along the
ridge, past a marshy area and lily pond and up a rockslide and awkward
scramble section to a survey marker knoll.  Then down a bit into brush and
blowdowns on a traverse right of the crest where we lost the way. After
beating the brush for a short while we picked up the trail again on the
crest. Another scramble section, a traverse on the left side, then right to
a fork in opening terrain. We chose the right fork (the left fork is
probably better) which traversed steep heather then snow to the right of
the ridge.  A final climb on snow straight up put us on the ridge at a tarn
nestled among rock slabs. ( 5 1/2 hrs, 4600 ft to here).
 
 We half expected to see Marty camped here, but we were all alone. Although
snowfree level spots were hard to come by, this was truly a lovely
campsite. The views were fantastic. We could see down to Diablo Lake and
across to the heart of the North Cascades.  Directly above us loomed aptly
named Pyramid Peak. And above to the left we could see Colonial Peak, the
toe of the Colonial Glacier (where a gorgeous waterfall spewed forth) and
the beginning of our route to Snowfield. We also had a nice source of water
in a stream issuing from the snow a short ways downhill. What more could
one want? Well, a few less mosquitoes would have been nice. They were now
out attacking in force.
 
We began our climb the next morning at 7:30. I had originally hoped to
climb Pyramid, Pinnacle, Paul Bunyan\'s Stump and Colonial in addition to
Snowfield, but... well, you know how it frequently goes. By the end of the
day we were happy just to have made Snowfield. From our camp, we picked up
the climber\'s trail (at the tarn) that descended several hundred feet down
a ramp to talus, traversed below cliffs of Pyramid Peak, then climbed back
up talus then snow, (following old footprints - someone had been this way
not too long ago) past the waterfall, and onto the Colonial Glacier at a
very interesting ice lake.  Again we expected to see Marty camped here, but
no signs of life.  Where on earth could they be. It became a running joke
with us.  Where was the phantom Marty?
 
We passed the ice lake on the right and continued up the glacier to the
Colonial - Neve col.  The last bit was steep and icy enough that we stopped
to put on crampons. At the col, where there was a nice bivy site (no, Marty
wasn\'t here either), we had our first view of Snowfield.  And what a
beautiful view it was. The Neve Glacier is quite large and encompasses the
high ridge of Snowfield, the Horseman and the Needle in a blanket of
rolling white.  The upper glacier looked quite smooth and free of crevasses
(turned out to be misleading) but the lower glacier was very broken up and
the right arm descended to Ladder Creek in a jumbled icefall. We descended
from the col until we could traverse left below cliffs to the large
flat saddle between the two arms of the lower Neve Glacier.  Here we roped
up.
 
Once on the glacier, we dodged a few crevasses on the flat, went up a rib,
traversed under a large crevasse and climbed onto the broad plateau of the
upper glacier. Here we discovered that what had appeared completely smooth
from below was actually riddled with dozens of traverse crevasses, some of
which went almost entirely across the slope and required a bit of wandering
around to avoid. The first ones were wide and open and easy to see, but the
higher ones were small and thinly covered with the fresh snow of the recent
storm. They were also easy to step over.
 
By noon we had worked our way to the notch on the west ridge.  We left ice
axes and crampons, unroped and scrambled up the easy slope of the ridge to
where we could work left into a gully. At the top of the gully we roped up
again for the exit left around a corner and down a step to an easy
ramp which was followed to a notch with rappel slings. (There is an easier
exit from the gully lower down that avoids the step down.) We stayed roped
to belay across the notch. but it was really quite easy with good holds,
then scrambled simultaneously the last bit to the summit at 2:00 (6 1/2
hours and 3500 ft).
 
The summit register had been placed in 1986 and had several interesting
entries. Jim Nelson and J. Martin had bivied on the summit while Martin
took the picture for his book, North Cascades Crest.  Don Goodman signed in
as part of a long traverse, and I recognized many other names, but Marty
was not among them.  So they hadn\'t gotten this far yet. We spent about an
hour on the summit enjoying the views to Eldorado, Backbone Ridge, Mt Baker
etc.
 
On the way down, the crevasses that had been covered on the way up had
melted out noticeable on this warm, sunny day. We were back at the Colonial
- Neve Col when the mystery of where Marty was was finally solved.  Linda
spotted  two figures far in the distance on the summit of Pyramid Peak.  It
was now 4:30.  Perhaps there was still time to try another peak, but we
both felt wiped out and decided to go directly back to camp, which we
reached at 6:15 (10:45 hrs and 4050 ft). We spent the remaining daylight
resting, eating, painting and fighting the bugs.
 
Our last day we were up at 5:30, and were feeling good enough to try for
Pyramid Peak before leaving. Pyramid is probably the easiest of the bunch
in this area and besides we wanted the meet the phantom Marty. So we
started again at 7:30 retracing our route to the ice lake. From there we
trended up and to the right until we could double back above the lower
cliffs toward Pyramid. Once on the gentle Pyramid ridge, an easy scramble
put us on top at 10:00 (2 1/2 hrs and 2000 ft), and who should be there but
Marty and friend.  They had bivied on the summit.  These two guys were very
familiar with the North Cascades. They spent every summer on an extended
trip exploring and poking around.  They were in no hurry to do anything,
just to soak up the beauty of the place. They were about half way through
their current 10 day trip and hoped to climb Snowfield the next day - or
maybe the day after.  They had weathered the recent storm in their tent
down on the Colonial Glacier. Their tent was rather hidden, off to side on
a small ourcropping of rock and being brown, blended in.  That is why we
never saw it.  We spent a pleasant hour chatting and they pointed out all
manner of neat climbs to do visible from our current vantage point.  Then
we got off on a discussion of summit registers and how the Park Service has
been removing them.  They were very much against this, as of course am I. 
I had brought a few registers with me to place as needed, but they beat me
to this one and Linda and I were cheerfully the second party to sign their
newly placed register.
 
We were back in camp by noon and left 2 hours later for the trip out. We
were able to stay on the trail where we had lost it on the way up but
almost lost it again at a different place.  We passed a party of two
sweating their way up the trail and wished them luck sticking to the trail.
We hit the lake at 4:00 and stopped long enough for a quick dip. Very
refreshing. We reached the car at 5:30. This was a great trip and I will be
back to get the peaks I missed. 23 miles and 11,250 ft.  Fay Pullen, 8/7-9,

Bailey Range Traverse, Northern Section (USGS Mt Carrie, Hurricane Hill,  Mt
Olympus, Mt Queets) - It had always been a dream of mine to  do  the  Bailey
Range Traverse but the difficult car shuttles and the  length  of  the  trip
always put me off.  Then I got the idea to go in via Appleton Pass  and  out
over Dodger Point and the Long Ridge Tr.  This would shorten the trip  to  5
days and  put  the  two  trailheads  within  10  miles  of  one  another,  a
reasonable distance to bike or hike.  Then Linda agreed to go  with  me  and
that simplified things even further. The peaks I hoped to  climb  along  the
way were Cat, Carrie, Stephen, Pulitzer, Ferry, Ludden and Scott.  We  ended
up getting 6 of the 7. Not too bad. We carried an ice axe, no  crampons  and
only a thin 20 ft rope in case we needed a short assist in  the  many  gully
crossings of the traverse. If the peaks themselves could  not  be  scrambled
we would not climb them.  I was not going to carry heavy  climbing  gear  on
this trip.
 
Day One - Linda and I met at the Elwa RS, picked up our permit, left  a  car
at Whiskey Bend, then drove to the Appleton  Pass  TH  and  started  up  the
trail at 11:15. We  started  in  iffy  weather, but  the  forecast  was  for
improving conditions and soon we were  getting  partial  clearing  and  some
views. The upper trail had been cleared of  all  the  avalanche  debris that
had come down the previous winter. Appleton Pass was reached at  3:30  where
we had our first rest. Here we stayed on the ridge following the  Cat  Creek
way trail. The flowers on this ridge were just gorgeous,  fields  of  lupine
and avalanche lilies.
 
We missed the proper descent off the ridge, wandering around a bit  to  pick
up the trail again as it led to Spread Eagle Pass. From here the  trail  was
easily followed as it traversed up and  down  across  3  basins.  The  trail
disappeared in talus after crossing  the  last  rib  above  Cat  Basin.   We
descended a bit to a small flat basin and a nice creek where we set up  camp
(elev 4500 ft) at 6:45 (13 miles, 5000 ft  and  7:30  hrs).  The  bugs  were
still tolerable here.
 
Day Two - From our camp we could see the trail below us  in  Cat  Basin,  so
just headed downhill toward it, starting at 8:15.  This was  to  be  a  long
day as we hoped to climb both Cat and  Carrie  and get  far  enough  on  the
traverse to find a decent place to camp. There had been a heavy  dew  during
the night soaking the foliage, so by the time we got to the  trail  we  were
somewhat wet. We followed the trail out of Cat  Basin  to  its  intersection
with the High Divide trail on the  ridge  above,  then  followed  this  good
trail to its sudden end on a hillside (2 hrs and 1400 ft).
 
A steep way trail led up to the start of the "Catwalk".  We left  our  packs
here, taking only essentials (My pack\'s top lid converts to a  fanny  pack. 
Linda used a very light day pack), and climbed to the  easy  summit  of  Cat
Pk.  There was no register on top. We had a great view of our  entire  route
so far from Appleton Pass. On the way back we met 2 women  who  were  camped
above Cat Basin.  They had previously done the Bailey traverse and  told  us
of a great campsite a few miles on.
 
Back at our packs (RT to Cat - 2 hrs and 1100 ft) we prepared for  the  real
start of the Bailey Range Traverse, which begins at the Catwalk. I had  read
about the Catwalk for years and had envisioned a lovely  knife  edged  ridge
of clean rock. It turned out to be a rather  unattractive  vegetated  narrow
dirt and rotten rock ridge. It was not very difficult either, but one  still
had to be careful, especially carrying full packs. It took us 35 minutes  to
cross and on the other side was the tiny pond of Boston  Charlie\'s  Camp.  A
steep climb, then the traversing began through lovely flowery meadows. At  a
spur ridge, we dropped the packs again  at  2:30  for  the dash  up  Carrie.
After a steep climb we picked up a  climber  trail  along  the  main  summit
ridge, traversed on scree and talus to the right  below  the  false  summit,
then headed around an upper  basin  on  snow  then  cruddy  scree  with  bad
footing to the top at 3:30.  A large new register had been placed  in  2000.
We quickly enjoyed the views, as  they  were  beginning  to  disappear  with
encroaching fog, then zipped back to our packs (RT to Carrie  -  2  hrs  and
1400 ft).
 
All we wanted now was to find a decent campsite, but the terrain  was  steep
sidehill for several miles and there were no level places, or running  water
for that matter. We crossed several annoying gullies and continued in an  up
and down traverse with more down than up. At 6:00 we came  upon  the  lovely
campsite (elev 5150 ft), mentioned by the  two  women, on  a  meadowy  bench
with a delightful cascading creek nearby where we were more  than  ready  to
stop (10 miles, 5400 ft and 10 hrs total). I set up my tiny tent  and  Linda
laid out her bivy sack to dry in the intermittent sun (they had been  packed
wet that morning from the heavy dew)  before  the  fog  rolled  in  for  the
night. On the hillside above we spotted a lone bear and  a  herd  of  goats,
which made us take more than the  usual  precautions  to  protect  food  and
gear. After turning in, a lone goat wandered  around  our  camp  all  night,
keeping me partially awake hoping the bear wouldn\'t do the same.
 
Day Three - We awoke to a magnificent view of  Mt  Olympus  across  the  Hoh
River and the entire goat herd, including two adorable kids, milling  around
looking for mischief. The bear was still on the hillside above us,  but  far
enough away to not pose a threat. This camp was such a lovely spot  that  we
were loath to leave. We had fun watching the goats, although we did have  to
guard our stuff, and I took the time to paint a sketch  of  Mt  Olympus,  my
only one of the trip. By the time we were ready to leave it was 9:30,  later
than I had planned. We would have to hustle.  Today  would  be  the  hardest
part of the traverse and I also wanted to climb Stephen Pk.
 
The traverse continued on steep hillside following a still good  way  trail,
but the terrain gradually became more difficult with several  tough  gullies
to cross.  One entailed a very steep descent with treacherous footing.  This
section was quite slow and took more time than  anticipated.  We  could  see
the ridge coming down from Stephen Pk that we had to cross to get  to  Cream
Lake.  It looked so close, but around every  corner  was  another  gully  to
cross. Finally, the way improved as we descended to 11 Bull Basin.  After  a
steep climb out of the basin  to  the aforementioned  wooded  ridge  and  we
thought the hard part was over. Ha!
 
From the ridge the trail deteriorated as it first sidehilled toward  Stephen
Pk, then dropped like a bomb over 1500  ft,  where  it  became  increasingly
rough and hard to follow. It led right to an awful blowdown area of  tangled
trees.  Here the biting flies became so bad  that  both  Linda  and  I  were
driven to put on long pants and sleeves. On the other side of the  blowdown,
nearing the valley bottom, the trail, now  very  faint,  led  to  the  right
downstream and in the opposite direction from Cream Lake. This  confused  me
greatly.   Linda  suggested   that   perhaps   it   was   avoiding   another
blowdown. Maybe.  But it hadn\'t avoided the first one and I felt others  may
have been led astray by an animal trail and the safest thing to do was  head
crosscountry directly  toward  the  lake  (via  GPS).  This  we  did.  After
crossing some avalanche debris, we entered the woods on the  other  side  of
the valley and headed uphill toward the lake. Soon  we  picked  up  a  trail
that led past a waterfall to Cream Lake at 1:15
 
Two Park Rangers were at  the  lake  (yes,  they  did  ask  if  we  had  our
permits). We discussed our route to the lake and how  we  had  gone  astray.
They said that was the way most people go, more or less.  There is  supposed
to be a high route that avoids the big descent  but  they  have  never  been
able to find it. We took a long lunch at the lake, and even a quick  dip  to
rinse off.  Very quick. The water was cold and the bugs relentless.  We  ate
sitting under netting.
 
From Cream Lake we followed the  creek  upstream  to  the  farthest  branch,
where we picked up a rough trail in a grassy gully.  We came out at a  small
tarn and found a nice campsite (elev 4750 ft)  on  the  knoll  above  it  (5
miles, 1700 ft and 5 3/4 hrs).  We quickly set up  camp,  then  started  for
Stephen Pk at 3:50. A steeply rising traverse up wet meadows (many signs  of
elk) led up to the main ridge where we crossed to a snow slope on the  other
(N) side and traversed W under  several  rocky  pinnacles  until  below  the
summit (my GPS helped determine where this was). Up snow, talus then a  last
class 3 scramble on rotten rock put us on top at 5:30.  The summit  register
dated from 1982 and didn\'t  have  that  many  entries.  We  relaxed  for  30
minutes in the sun and watched a graceful hawk ride the air  currents  below
us. Magnificent! Then we beat a hasty retreat back to camp arriving at  7:15
(RT to Stephen 1900 ft and 3:25 hrs) where the bugs were out in force.
 
Day Four - We spotted a herd of elk  on  the  hillside  near  our  route  to
Stephen peak before we left at 8:30. When we started this trip Linda  stated
that this being the Olympics she wanted to see bear, goats and  elk.   Well,
she was now three for three. Upper Cream  Basin  was  gorgeous  open  alpine
terrain and there were many choices of route as  we  wandered  past  meadows
and many tarns heading for the Ferry - Pulitzer  saddle.   We  followed  the
main creek into a large flat basin, then into increasingly rocky  and  snowy
terrain to a large tarn at the foot of the tiny Pulitzer  Glacier.   Here  a
trail led up past cliffs to the smaller tarn just below the saddle. We  left
packs here for the short trip up Pulitzer Pk, on easy  snow  then  shattered
rock to the false summit.  The true summit was a short distance  away  along
a narrow exposed ridge.  It looked pretty bad.   Linda  wisely  decided  the
false summit was good enough, but I decided to give it a go. It  turned  out
to be not very difficult but rather dangerous.  I do believe  I  have  never
climbed on such rotten steep rock.  Every hold was loose  and  the  rock  as
sharp as the edge of a knife.  I ended up with several cuts on my hands.   I
did make it to the top but  in  retrospect  it  probably  wasn\'t  worth  the
risk.  I wouldn\'t do it again.  There was no register on  top  (probably  no
one else was stupid enough to  climb  it)  so  I  left  one.  After  a  nice
glissade we were back to our packs at noon (RT to Pulitzer - 700  ft  and  1
1/2 hrs).
 
From the saddle we headed up a way trail to  the  Ferry  shoulder.  We  left
packs again for the quick, trivial  ascent  of  Ferry  (RT  160  ft  and  20
minutes). Then we started the descent  off  Ferry  heading  for  the  Scott-
Ludden saddle.  We could see a good trail along the ridge in  the  distance,
but first we had to descend a rocky step a couple of hundred feet.  Here  we
met a couple going the same direction.  The husband  had  taken  the  wife\'s
pack down the step, so she could descend  pack  less,  then  come  back  for
his.  Wish I had someone like that - or do I? He "kindly"  offered  to  show
us the way to the saddle, but we declined, and soon  left  them  behind.  He
also offered advice on climbing Ludden that turned out to be  erroneous  and
contrary to my own instincts. Because of this we  left  our  packs  and  the
trail too  soon  and  ended  up  backtracking.  I  should  have  trusted  my
instincts.  We followed the ridge to the rather nondescript summit  where  I
left another register. Back to the packs (RT to Ludden - 800 ft and  2  hrs)
we followed the trail, very steeply in  places,  down  to  the  Scott-Ludden
saddle (elev 4750 ft) at 5:00 and a nice grassy meadow with  a  tiny  stream
(8 miles, 3500 ft and 8 1/2 hrs total).
 
I had wanted to try for Mt Scott, but both Linda  and  I  just  ran  out  of
steam. She suggested we climb it in the morning, but we had a  long  way  to
go out tomorrow and some possible routefinding problems  to  get  to  Dodger
Pt.  I felt we had to climb it now or not at all.  So we  called  it  a  day
and stopped at 6 peaks total. Our campsite was very  pleasant.   The  little
stream even had a pool large enough to wash up in, but  the  bugs  were  the
worst of the whole trip. We covered up  completely,  did  chores  with  head
nets on and ate dinner under a large net
 
Day Five - From the saddle we could see the abandoned trail we  were  aiming
for carved into the hillside across the  valley  at  pretty  much  the  same
elevation as we were at, but getting to it was no easy task (this trail  had
never been completed and so just came to a deadend on  the  side  of  Ludden
Pk).  A way trail descended about 500 ft very steeply to get  below  cliffs,
then dropped into a rugged gully (a few climbing moves needed  here)  before
climbing extremely steep loose dirt up the other side to hit the  old  trail
at its very end. (570 ft and 1:15 hrs) This point was not  real  obvious  so
Linda thoughtfully built a couple of cairns to help the next party out.
 
The old trail was easily followed and a pleasure after the rough  routes  of
the past few days,  until  we  rounded  a  corner  and  unexpectedly  hit  a
snowpatch in a narrow gully.  The snow was completely undermined by a  creek
and not safe to cross, and too steep to go around the  top,  so  we  entered
the resulting cave  from  the  top  and  exited  from  the  bottom,  getting
somewhat drenched in the process, where  we  could  climb  back  up  to  the
trail.
 
We hit the Long Ridge Tr at 11:30 where it was a long 10 miles down  to  the
Elwa trail.  Whoever engineered this trail must have been paid by the  mile.
It switchbacked endlessly barely losing any elevation  at  all.   The  trail
could easily have been made half as long  with no problem at all.   We  were
entertained on the long way out by various parties struggling up the  trail.
One fellow had a sock over his boot holding  a  separating  sole  together. 
And he was on the start of a 10 day trip to the Bailey Range (going  in  the
way we had just come out) that included climbing  Mt  Olympus.  I  shuddered
when I thought of that boot on the steep terrain we had  just  experienced. 
What                   was                   he                    thinking?





                                          I would have postponed my  trip  a
day in order to have decent boots. Another fellow we noticed had a bag  full
of spare batteries that must have weighed several pounds.  Perhaps he had  a
computer hidden in his pack.
 
We hit the Elwa bridge at 4:15 where  we  were  treated  to  a  fast  moving
thunderstorm, but very little rain, and Whiskey Bend at  5:30  (16.5  miles,
1800 ft and 8:15 hrs). Then all we had to do was pick up the  other  car  at
the Appleton Pass TH, which took another hour. Grand total - 55.5 miles  and
19600 ft. - Fay Pullen - 8/20-24, 2002.

Ugly Duckling (USGS Chikamin Pk) - This is the 5140 ft peak NE  of  Swan  Lk
and is probably only of interest to Home Court peak baggers.  Logging  roads
climb to within 400 ft of the summit and would have little  to  offer  as  a
summer objective. However, as a winter ski trip it could be a  good  workout
and provide a little summit as a bonus. With this in mind,  I  started  from
the Kachess Lake SnoPark at 11:00 on a snowy morning.  The access road  from
I-90 had not yet been plowed and the 8 inches of fresh snow made me  glad  I
had a Cherokee.  Fortunately, the ubiquitous snowmobiles of this  area  were
already out in force and I did  not  have  to  break  trail  to  start.   An
advantage of a late start. I did, however have to  breathe  their  fumes  as
they streamed past.

I followed the well packed main road past Kachess Lake, then up  along  side
Gale Creek some 6 miles to the turnoff to  Swan  Lake.  No  snowmobiles  had
been up this side road so now I did have to break trail and my  pace  slowed
to half that on the main road. I followed this spur for  about  3  miles  to
the last switchback below the summit.  Here I left  the  road  and  followed
just inside the forest line, where trail breaking was easier, to  the  ridge
NW of the summit.  I kept on skis as long as  possible,  but  about  100  ft
from the top I was forced to abandon them due to steepness and scrub  trees.
Without  the  benefit  of  skis  I  immediately   sank   thigh   deep   into
unconsolidated snow.  But that wasn\'t the worst of my problems.  I  now  had
a clear view of the summit and  it  appeared  to  be  a  30  ft  high  rocky
pinnacle.  I wasn\'t prepared for this. From the map I had  thought  I  could
probably climb to the summit the whole way on skis.  Who knew  that  one  of
those contour lines hid a small cliff?

I immediately gave up on a direct attack on the pinnacle. I had no  climbing
gear, not even an ice axe and there was no way I could force my way up  that
last rock face safely.  My only chance was an end run around to the SW  side
and hope there was a break in the cliffs. So  I  descended  a  bit  until  I
could traverse a short ways under the cliff band, then worked  my  way  back
up to the ridge.  Work is the key word here.  Seldom have I worked  so  hard
to gain so little elevation.  I literally had to  built  steps  up,  pulling
the top foot of snow down and packing  it  in  one  step  at  a  time  so  I
wouldn\'t sink in to my waist.  It was painfully slow and daylight  was  fast
running out, but I wasn\'t going to quit now. I made  it  to  the  ridge  and
thankfully a smooth snow slope led to the summit on the other side.  It  had
taken over an hour to climb the last 100 ft to the top (3200 ft and  6  hr).
What a challenge this little peak turned out to be!

It was now 5:00 and dark. I quickly added  some  clothing,  changed  my  now
soaking gloves, got out my headlamp and started down. With my built trail  I
was soon back at my skis for the fun run down to the  main  road.  I  rather
enjoy skiing by headlamp.  I sometimes find the visibility even better  than
the flat light of day, and LED lights are often  enough  on  the  reflective
snow, especially on an  easy  logging  road.   Anyway,  I  was  back  to  my
snowcovered car at 8:30, slowed considerably at the end by  skis  that  iced
up terribly, despite frequent scraping, and refused to  glide  well  on  the
last long level stretch of road. It had snowed all day long. 18 miles,  3500
ft and 9:30 hr.  Fay Pullen, 12/30/02.

Low Mountain (USGS Snoqualmie Pass) - As snow was too  sparse  and  icy  for
decent skiing, my intent on this beautiful cold sunny day was just  a  quick
climb up Granite Mtn to enjoy the views  and  get  some  exercise.  But  the
weather was so nice and the conditions so good for travel that on  the  spur
of the moment I decided to go for Low Mtn.  I have been up Granite  so  many
times I wanted to try something more exciting. So  where  the  summit  trail
(well booted but icy to this point) makes a big arc back to the NW  at  4400
ft, I continued straight ahead in a rising  traverse.  The  snow  was  hard,
though beginning to melt in the sun, and made for reasonable  step  kicking,
but the initial slopes were steep and concentration was needed  to  avoid  a
slip that could send me all the way down to the westbound lanes of I-90.

I crossed the SE ridge of Granite at about 4700 ft, then  began  a  downward
traverse through very pleasant  terrain  to  lovely  Denny  Lake.  Here  the
northern exposure slopes retained some unexpected  powdery  snow.  From  the
lake I headed up to the S ridge of Low.  So far the snow had  been  firm  if
not  icy,  but  once  on  the  crest  itself  it  softened  to  inconsistent
postholing, so I was finally forced to  put  on  snowshoes.   An  easy  trek
along the ridge with minor ups and down, led past  two  false  summits,  the
second of which was rocky and required removal of  snowshoes,  to  the  open
top with good views of surrounding peaks (4.5 hrs and 4450 ft).

For the return trip, I followed the ridge back to  the  saddle  above  Denny
Lake, but did not descend to the lake itself or retrace  my  steps  farther.
Instead I continued up the N ridge of Granite toward the  lookout.   I  kept
my snowshoes on the whole time, as  much  for  their  crampons  as  for  the
inconsistent snow. For it was now getting late and anything that had  melted
in the sun was starting to freeze again. When the ridge began to  gentle,  I
traversed on the E side until I hit the main Granite Mtn trail in the  basin
E of the lookout at about 5200 ft. I popped over the SE ridge just  at  dusk
with the last light fading behind Mt Rainier.

I was now the last person on the mountain and had it all to myself.  I  kept
the snowshoes on for a while, but the slope soon became too  steep  and  icy
for comfort, and crampons made for more security.  I kept those on  for  the
slippery trail all the way to  the  Pratt  Lake  junction,  where  all  snow
ended.  A peaceful hike down the rest of the trail by headlamp ended a  most
enjoyable trip.

I realize that there is a more direct route up Low Mtn  from  the  Denny  Cr
Trail, but I think the way I went has much to recommend it, particularly  in
stable winter conditions.  It is very scenic, there is no brush  and  it  is
surprising how interesting the terrain is on the  NE  side  of  Granite.  11
miles, 9 hrs, 5350 ft RT. Fay Pullen, 1/10/03.

Lightning Peak (USGS Mt Skokomish & Lightning Pk)  -  My  first  attempt  on
this peak I followed the route  described  by  Stefan  on  6/7/98  (see  WTA
website).  However, this being winter the logging road  was  gated  about  Â½
mile before the crossing of Elk Cr at 1680 ft.  So I used  a  mountain  bike
to travel the remaining 4 miles to the  road  end  at  3200  ft.  Due  to  a
northern exposure, much of the last 2 miles of this road  was  covered  with
hard crusty snow.

From the road end, I climbed up and over a steep bump, then  traversed  left
and up on hard snow to a 4040 ft notch just right of  a  rocky  pinnacle  on
Lightning\'s W ridge.  Here  I  was  met  with  sunshine  and  almost  barren
snowfree slopes.  What a difference a southern exposure makes! The  traverse
E along the rocky ridge was pleasant and fun but slow, winding  in  and  out
around numerous pinnacles. The last summit block was  climbed  via  a  short
chimney to a notch in a S spur ridge, passing through  to  the  other  side,
then easier rock back up to the main  ridge  and  what  I  thought  was  the
summit, marked with a "Timber" BM. I did see another rocky point  farther  E
along the ridge but, as I had run out of time, I convinced myself I  was  on
the summit (3500 ft & 5 hrs).

I made it back to the 4040 ft notch just at dusk and proceeded to spend  the
next 2 hours wandering around in the dark trying to follow my tracks on  the
hard snow and my GPS, which gave inconsistent readings much of the time.  At
times I was very confused.  But somehow I found my way back to  the  logging
road and my bike. I had just invested in a new 12-volt  halogen  bike  light
(much brighter than any of my headlamps) which was now worth its  weight  in
gold on the ride back down to the car in the dark. (13 miles, 4000  ft  9:30
hrs, 2/7/03)

Once home, I made the unpleasant discovery that the "Timber" BM  is  on  the
false summit and the true summit was the rocky point farther E.  How  I  had
missed this in my reading I don\'t know.  Oh  well,  that  just  gave  me  an
excuse to go back and try a different route.

This time I decided to try Route 2 up  Elk  Cr  described  in  the  Climbers
Guide  to  the  Olympic  Mtns.   This  route  actually  turned  out  to   be
preferable, at least this time of year.  Although  the  initial  brush  bash
through an old clearcut along the creek was unpleasant, it didn\'t take  long
to enter older forest and easier going. I reached the 2600  ft  "meadow"  in
about 1.5 hrs, then turned left up steep but reasonable forest to hit  the  N
ridge at 3200 ft. From here the route turned downright  pleasant  -  a  snow
ridge to an open snow slope that led directly to the notch between the  true
and false summit. The snow here was hard and required crampons and the  last
pitch to the notch steep, icy and very  sporting.  I  was  able  to  slither
through a melted out opening in the capping cornice in this  low  snow  year
and emerge into welcome sunshine. 20 minutes later I was on the true  summit
(3200 ft & 4 hrs.)

There was still time left and the day beautiful, so I  zipped  over  to  the
false summit again, just for fun. Then back to the true summit.  The  summit
had an old metal register with a soggy notebook that was partially  legible.
I had left it to dry in the sun  during  my  hour  roundtrip  to  the  false
summit. I relaxed for another half hour enjoying  the  views  of  Washington
and Ellinor, added a waterproof notebook to the register, then  not  wanting
to descend the steep pitch from the notch, continued along the ridge to  the
E until I could work my way back N to intersect  my  ascent  route,  a  much
easy way. I made it back to the road just at dark,  a  very  nice  climb.  5

Dirtyface Pk (USGS Lake Wenatchee) - Starting from the Lake Wenatchee RS,  I
made good time up the Dirtyface trail to  the  old  lookout  site,  probably
because I was chased by hoards of mosquitoes (4.5 miles, 3800  ft  and  2.5
hrs).  From here I made an attempt to follow the confusing directions in  75
Scrambles to the true summit of Dirtyface some 2  miles  away.   Thinking  I
should stay on the ridge I did some interesting  scrambling  before  finding
myself trapped above a lateral cliff and having to descend some  500  ft  to
5400 ft on the N to get around it.  I was then able to work my way  back  up
to the broad saddle S of the south summit.  Here 75  Scrambles  directs  you
to descend S to 5400 ft.  Wrong!  A  simple  contour  leads  to  the  saddle
between the north and south peaks. Chalk up another  major  error  for  this
guide book. (I am  assuming  the  book  reversed  the  two  above  mentioned
saddles. The descent is required  to  get  to  the  first  saddle,  not  the
second. Had I known this ahead of time I could have saved myself  a  lot  of
confusion.)

From the N-S saddle I followed the ridge easily to the base of  the  N  peak
where a pleasant class 3 rock scramble led to the summit (6.5  miles,  5100
ft and 5:30 hrs). Nestled in amongst the summit rocks were  some  absolutely
gorgeous clumps of  Lewisia  tweedii.  A  new  Mountaineer  summit  register
placed in June 2002 with two entries graced the summit cairn.

I could see all the way back along the  convoluted  ridge  to  the  LO  from
whence I had come. It had taken me 3 hours to get here from there and  would
most likely take almost that long to get back again given all  the  ups  and
downs on the ridge and the need to descend and climb again to get  past  the
lateral cliff. Then I still had to descend  the  4.5  mile  trail.  Not  an
appealing prospect. The guidebook  mentioned  an  alternate  route  directly
down Siverly Cr from the N-S saddle to the Lake Wenatchee road.   Given  the
track record of errors in this guide book and the fact that the  map  showed
this route to be very steep I was somewhat  reluctant  to  trust  myself  to
this way, but it seemed the lesser of two evils to me at the time.

So once back at the N-S  saddle  I  launched  myself  swiftly  downhill.  It
started well, down open meadowy slopes. When the brush became bad, a bit  of
a traverse left into timber worked for a while.   Eventually  I  was  forced
back into a section of dense brush where I floundered  for  a  while  before
being once again able to exit  left  into  timber.  A  bit  of  grassy  open
hillside, a section of cliff  to  circumvent,  more  floundering  through  a
tangle of maple flat and I emerged onto the road in  a  cloud  of  voracious
mosquitoes. Miraculously a stiff breeze came up to blow the  obnoxious  bugs
away and make the 1.5 mile walk along the road back to  the  ranger  station
tolerable. This actually turned out to be a  reasonable  route  and  shorter
than reversing my way up (3 hours down from summit). 11 miles, 5600  ft  and
9 hours total.  Fay Pullen, 6/18/03.

promised to be a long day,) I decided to go  with  the  written  directions,
but had no faith that they would actually lead me  to  the  summit.  I  have
grown very disappointed with this  guidebook  which  is  just  riddled  with
major errors.

I parked on the wide shoulder of Hywy  20  (1900  ft)  2.8  miles  from  the
Colonial Cr Campground and headed into  the  woods  just  left  of  a  small
boulder field working my way up onto the ridge above. Once on  the  ridge  I
climbed steeply through open  forest  and  intermittent  mossy  cliff  bands
gaining elevation rapidly. At 3600 ft I ran into  an  orange  flag,  a  good
sign others had been this way and maybe that I was on the right  route.  But
I only found several more and then they disappeared for good.

Somewhere around 4200 ft, where the ridge makes a jog  to  the  S,  I  found
myself on a sub ridge barred from gaining access back to the main  ridge  by
a rock wall. Traversing under the cliff up a marshy creek bed  then  through
awful brush I was able to get back onto the main ridge  at  about  4800  ft.
Now the ridge began to open up with meadows and views and even a  faint  way
trail that came and went. The final 1000 ft was a  pleasant  scramble  along
the now rocky ridge to  the  summit  where  I  was  greeted  by,  horror  of
horrors, what I would guess to be that proliferating sign of  the  times,  a
solar powered cell tower (5600 ft gain and 5 hrs). Seemed completely out  of
place.

Ignoring the tower and supporting guy wires I spent a  very  enjoyable  hour
on the summit taking in the 360 view, from Snowfield to  Logan  to  Jack  to
the Pickets. The trip down was a pleasure along the open ridge, then  became
a challenge in the woods to stay  on  route  and  avoid  the  various  cliff
bands.  At times I had to backtrack uphill to find the way and so  I  didn\'t
make as good a time downhill as I had hoped. 6000 ft  and  10  hours  total.

Colonial Pk, Paul Bunyan\'s Stump, Pinnacle Pk (USGS Ross Dam) - Last year  I
climbed Snowfield and Pyramid but didn\'t have time to  include  these  three
peaks, so I was back this year to correct this situation. I  approached  the
same way as before, up the Pyramid Lake trail and  then the  climbers  trail
to Pyramid Ridge.  As the saying goes, it is easier the second  time  around
and  this time made no errors in route finding.  I found a gravelly spot  to
camp very near the ice lake at the base of the Colonial Glacier at  5900  ft
(5000ft gain and 5:40 hrs).

I set up camp and attempted to heat water for some tea and soup.  But as  it
was very windy, I placed  my  windscreen  too  closely  around  my  canister
stove, which caused it to overheat and essentially  turn  into  a  fireball.
Then I burned  a  couple  a  fingers  on  both  hands  trying  to  move  the
windscreen and turn off the stove. I immediately  plunged  both  hands  into
the icy water of a nearby creek.  This was not  a  great  start  and  I  was
worried how my damaged fingers would affect my climbing, especially  on  the
rock of Pinnacle.

Undeterred, I was off at 4:30 pm to climb Colonial.  The  route  was  pretty
straightforward up the gentle Colonial Glacier to  the  base  of  a  steeper
snow finger leading toward the ridge above. On the way  up  my  now  painful
fingers caused me to insert them at frequent intervals into the  soft  snow.
This seemed to help.  As soon as possible I  exited  the  snow  finger  left
onto loose but easy rock and traversed around to talus  then  more  snow  to
the notch W of the peak.  An unpleasant loose gully led to more  solid  rock
on the ridge and the summit at 7:00.   A  deteriorating  notebook  inside  a
nice cylinder had been placed on May 25, l986.  I noted the ascent of  Laura
Zimmerman and Jim  Brisbane  on  June  1  of  this  year.   I  added  a  new
waterproof notebook to the register, then headed back down, arriving  at  my
tent at 8:45.

I now determined that my accident had destroyed the canister  and  my  stove
was nonfunctional, so I could not heat water for dinner. I made do  with  an
energy bar and cold drinks and turned in early. I  did  the  same  the  next
morning for breakfast and made the startling discovery that you  can  get  a
faster start if you don\'t have to cook. An advantage  surely,  but  I  still
missed my morning tea.  Surprisingly, my fingers hardly hurt at all  in  the
morning and gave me very little trouble the rest of  the  day.   Maybe  cold
therapy really works.

I was at the saddle S of Paul Bunyan\'s Stump by 7:00 am.  This was a  lovely
spot, flat and heathery and would be a nice place to camp.  I worked my  way
up the broad S ridge on heather and interesting slabs to  the  base  of  the
first cliffs.  The upper cliffs looked very  intimidating,  but  a  traverse
left revealed a wide ledge leading to a  gully  on  the  W  side  which  led
easily to the summit ridge. A few careful moves  along  the  narrow  exposed
crest and I was on top, a very pleasant climb indeed (1600 ft  and  2  hrs).
There was no register so I left one.

Next on the agenda was Pinnacle Pk.  I got a good look  the  SW  route  from
Paul Bunyan and didn\'t like what I saw so decided to try the N ridge  route.
So after descending from Paul Bunyan, I climbed back up on easy snow to  the
Pinnacle-Pyramid saddle.  I saw a possible  route  on  broken  rock  to  the
right above a snow finger.  The hardest part was exiting the  undercut  snow
onto the rock itself.  From here an easy but very loose gully led to  the  N
ridge.  The ridge itself was quite solid and fun, if  exposed,  climbing  to
the N notch. Here an 80 ft class 4 face caused me to rope up.   I  passed  a
rappel sling at the top of the  face.   The  summit  was  only  a  few  feet
farther along the crest (1000ft and 2 hrs from Paul Bunyan).  There  was  no
summit register but I had forgotten to bring one along when I left  my  pack
at the start of the rock climbing. Darn!

I did a couple of rappels to get off the rock, then  zipped  down  the  snow
back  to  my  tent.   I  had  a  couple  of  hours  to  enjoy  my  beautiful
surroundings before heading out.  It took 3.5 hrs to get  back  to  my  car.

About 21 miles and 10,000 ft elev gain.  Fay Pullen, 7/17-18/ 2003.

Camp Robber, by Fay Pullen

IRON CAP (USGS  Mt Daniel, Big Snow Mtn) - I had originally  planned  to  do
this peak and 3 others from the West Fork Foss  River,  but  concluded  that
was too ambitious for a 3-day trip.  Instead I decided to make it  the  sole
objective of a 2-day trip from the  Dutch  Miller  Trail.   Besides,  I  had
always wanted to camp at the charming Chain Lakes below La Bohn Gap  and  it
was now or never before the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River Road is  closed  at
Dingford Creek (planned for fall 2003).  So I again found myself driving  up
this awful road (I had climbed Burntboot Pk a few weeks  earlier)  and  then
starting from the TH in a  light  rain.   The  forecast  was  for  improving
conditions during the day and good weather  for  tomorrow.  The  light  rain
stayed with me all the way to Williams Lake where it began to  rain  harder.
I was beginning to doubt the accuracy of the forecast. Rounding the  lake  I
picked up the way trail to  Chain  Lakes  at  the  mine  on  the  far  side.
Miraculously, the rain quit just as I was picking out a scenic  campsite  on
a knoll between two of the larger tarns (9 miles, 3300 ft, 5:45  hrs).   But
by this time I was so wet and exposed to a chilling wind  that  things  were
looking rather bleak.  I retreated to my warm sleeping  bag  and  hoped  for
better things tomorrow.

I awoke the next morning to a bright blue sky and  sunshine  and  things  no
longer looked so bleak.  What a glorious day! Recharged with energy,  I  was
on my way by 7:30.  I climbed the ridge directly W  of  my  camp,  descended
400 ft into the basin on the other side  and  contoured  at  about  5300  ft
across steep talus until I could climb up to the broad flat  area  S  of  Pt
6263.  I then rambled through gorgeous meadows and rock  gardens,  following
the odd cairn and bits of way trail tread, to Iron Cap Pass.   This  has  to
be one of the most scenic sections of the Alpine Lakes High Traverse  and  I
thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.

The way trail went downhill from the pass, but since my destination was  the
peak and not the traverse, I stayed high on the ridge until I could  contour
into the bowl on the NE side of Iron Cap.   A  few  icy  snowpatch  remnants
were easily avoided as I climbed toward the notch just E of the  summit  and
gained the "obvious" (I hate to use this term, but in this case it truly  is
obvious and the only viable escape through the cliffs) ledge slanting up  to
the right. At the end of the ledge a bit of steep heather  and  a  few  bush
belays led to the easy summit slopes and I was on top  by  11:15  (1900  ft,
3:45 hr).

I signed the register and noted a recent entry by  Don  Goodman  stating  he
had made the ascent via a traverse from Hardscrabble Lakes.  Looking W  down
the ridge in that direction it appeared a long and difficult route. I  spent
a pleasant hour on the summit, then headed back arriving  at  camp  at  3:00
(3100 ft, 7:30 hr).  Again I greatly enjoyed the traverse across the  lovely
alpine terrain.  I really didn\'t want it to end.  I spent some time at  camp
exploring old mines before leaving at 5:00 for the 4 hour trip to  the  car.
24 miles, 7000 ft, - Fay Pullen, Kent, 9/19-20.


WILD GOAT, TOURMALINE, CAMP ROBBER (USGS Big Snow Mtn)   -  Two  days  later
found me back in the area trying for the  other  three  peaks  on  my  list.
This time I approached from the West Fork Foss  River  Trail  and  I  had  a
companion, Linda. We began at 11:00 and by 4:00 we were at the  end  of  the
maintained trail at Big Heart Lake (passing Trout, Copper and  Little  Heart
Lakes on the way). Here we met two fellows coming out from  Azure  Lake  who
had cut short  their  original  plan  to  complete  the  Alpine  Lakes  High
Traverse to the Necklace  Valley  complaining  they  ran  out  of  time  and
energy.  One of them described the continuing way trail to Chetwood Lake  as
terrible and downright dangerous in places.  We did not find this to be  the
case.  As way trails go this one was easily  followed  and,  though  it  did
wander up and down a bit and had a few scramble moves here and there it  was
not really that bad.

As the way trail traversed  the  ridge  between  Big  Heart  Lake  and  Lake
Angeline, the terrain became increasingly more alpine and lovely in  nature.
 We set up camp by a delightful tarn on the E ridge of  Tourmaline  Pk  just
before the trail descended to Chetwood Lake (9 miles, 5000 ft, 7 hrs).

We woke the next morning to clouds and fog and a heavy  dew.   Not  what  we
had hoped for. Nevertheless we started at 8:45 for Wild Goat.   We  followed
the trail down to Chetwood Lake, then the rather rugged N  shore  (not  much
of a trail here) to Chetwood Pass.   We  climbed  SW  up  steep  heather,  W
across a spur right to drop into a talus basin, then up to the  notch  W  of
the summit for the final scramble along the ridge to the 6305 ft  top  (1450
ft, 2:50 hrs).  We found a bottle register  here  recently  placed  by  Mike
Collins.

The fog was  beginning  to  lift  by  now  and  we  had  fleeting  views  of
Tourmaline and Iron Cap.  I was really glad now that I had  already  climbed
Iron Cap and didn\'t have to add it to the agenda.  It looked like  it  would
take the rest of the day to get there from here.  We studied Tourmaline  for
a more direct ascent from  our  present  position.   Several  routes  looked
possible but the whole southern side facing us was quite cliffy,  and  since
we carried no climbing gear, we decided the best we could safely  do  was  a
direct route from Chetwood Pass to the E ridge,  rather  than  return  along
the shoreline of Chetwood Lake to the way trail.  This  we  managed  to  do,
staying below the cliffy areas, and emerged on the ridge  a  couple  hundred
ft above our camp.  From there it was an easy scramble up big  talus  blocks
and slabs to the 6245 ft summit (3000 ft, 6:45 hrs).  On  the  way  we  were
treated to several impressive veins of tourmaline rock for  which  the  peak
is named.

The fog had by now completely lifted.  Camp Robber, connected to  Tourmaline
by a long ridge, looked at least a mile off but  didn\'t  appear  to  be  too
difficult. Linda had had enough and elected to go directly back to camp,  so
I set off alone for my last peak at 4:00.  I descended NW to a  rocky  basin
and began a very enjoyable traverse on bedrock slabs and  large  blocks.   I
just love this type of scrambling and was greatly enjoying myself,  although
time was beginning to be an issue. It would be dark  at  7:00.  I  kept  the
traverse as high as possible below the  cliffs  of  the  ridgeline  until  I
could begin ascending to the summit ridge.  Unfortunately, I  misjudged  and
hit a false summit first.  Darn! A short descent and class 3  scramble  were
required to make it to the true 6286 ft summit at 5:00 (3600 ft,  8:15  hr).
Here I found a Mountaineer register left by Don Goodman on  6/5/01  and  the
familiar names of Mitch Blanton, Don Beavon and Mike Collins.

I miscued  a  bit  on  the  way  back.   Not  wanting  to  gain  unnecessary
elevation. I tried to contour from the rocky basin directly to  Tourmaline\'s
E ridge, got too low and ran into cliffs.  I had to climb up  and  over.   I
made it to camp at 6:30 where Linda had hot water  ready  for  dinner  (3800
ft, 9:45 hr).  I was one tired but happy climber.

Our last day dawned sunny and clear  but  with  another  heavy  dew.   While
waiting for the tent to dry in the sun, we were  first  visited  by  a  lone
(lonely?) fellow who talked our ears off for almost an hour.   He  had  come
from Big Heart Lake and was on his way to Chetwood Lake,  or  wherever.   He
really didn\'t care, as he had no destination.  He was just wandering  around
for a week or so.  He had gotten this far so we assumed he knew what he  was
doing although he seemed a little out  of  it.   We  were  next  visited  by
another fellow coming from Chetwood.  He was on  his  third  day  from  Lake
Dorothy.  He had intended to do  this  version  of  the  Alpine  Lakes  High
Traverse but found the terrain too difficult and slow and so  quit  at  this
point.  It seems many people underestimate the difficulty of  the  Traverse.
At least this guy didn\'t seem disposed to long conversation and was  quickly
on his way. Our campsite was becoming positively crowded and  tent  was  now
dry so it was time to go (10:30).

On the way out we were entertained by a fisherman  at  Big  Heart  Lake  who
complained that he hadn\'t had so much as a nibble.  No  sooner  had  we  sat
down nearby for a rest than he reeled  in  a  good  sized  trout,  which  he
promptly dropped and lost after unhooking it.  In the effort  to  hang  onto
it he fell into the water himself, boots  and  all.   He  then  tried  again
(after removing his soggy boots) and  landed  another  smaller  fish  a  few
minutes later.  This one he lost also, "deliberately", or so  he  said.   So
were we good luck or bad luck for him?

At Copper Lake we stopped to take a dip.  Although the  day  was  warm,  the
water was not, but it was refreshing.   Just  above  Trout  Lake  we  met  a
family with small children struggling up the trail  headed  for  a  camp  at
Malachite Lake.  It was now about 4:00.  We knew  they  had  a  stiff  climb
ahead of them and were going to be hard pressed to get to a campsite  before
dark.  They really should have stopped at Trout Lake.  25 miles, 10,100  ft,

October 5-6, 2003, Tower Mtn and Golden Horn, by Fay Pullen

TOWER MTN, GOLDEN HORN (USGS Washington Pass) - I  was  well  aware  of  the
wildfires burning in the NE sections of our mountains at this  time  and  of
the many road and trail closures because of them, but I did not  expect  the
closures to extend to the west  of  Washington  Pass,  or  if  they  did,  I
expected the closures to be prominently displayed at  the  TH.   So  when  I
pulled into the PCT North TH near Rainy Pass at  10:30  on  a  bright  sunny
morning and saw several other cars in  the  parking  lot  and  no  signs,  I
thought I was safe.

I was packed up and ready to hit the trail by  11:00,  full  of  energy  and
anticipation to climb a pair of attractive peaks in an attractive area.   So
I was absolutely stunned when some 200 feet up the  trail  I  encountered  a
small sign stating the PCT was closed at  Cutthroat  Pass.   My  peaks  were
some 5 miles past Cutthroat Pass.  Why wasn\'t this sign on the reader  board
or at the very least visible from the TH?  In a somewhat state of shock  and
mostly propelled by momentum and not knowing what else to do, I  decided  to
continue to Cutthroat Pass and reassess the situation there.   Perhaps  they
had just forgotten to take the sign down.

Upon reaching Cutthroat Pass (5 miles, 1900 ft, 2.5 hrs), sure enough  there
was a trail barrier and sign indicating the trail was  closed.  What  to  do
now? After searching (very briefly) my usually very law abiding soul, I  did
what any  self-respecting  climber  would  do.   I  ignored  the  signs  and
continued on my way.  Now don\'t get me wrong.  I have the  greatest  respect
for and fear of wildfires.  They are not to be treated  lightly.   The  same
respect does not extend to bureaucrats who insist on  thinking  for  me  and
saving me from myself.  As a climber I am certainly able  to  assess  danger
to myself and how much I am willing to risk.  Climbers do it all  the  time.
So here I am at beautiful Cutthroat Pass.  There is not a cloud in the  sky.
 There are no fires visible on the horizon, or even smoke for  that  matter.
My conclusion is that the fires are far away and the forest service is  just
covering their rear ends and limiting their liability in case  a  fire  gets
out of hand.  If I am wrong in my assessment, then that is my  fault  and  I
am willing to pay the consequences.

And so I continue on the lovely trail past Cutthroat Pass.  My enjoyment  of
the beautiful scenery (this has to be one the most scenic  sections  of  the
PCT and a very impressive view of Tower and Golden Horn is to  be  had  from
the trail above Granite Pass) is tempered by my fear that behind every  rock
and around every corner is a ranger just waiting to give me a  citation  for
unlawful trespass.  I  don\'t  make  a  very  good  outlaw.   I  am  consoled
somewhat by fresh boot tracks in the dusty trail.  Others have been  outlaws
too.

I made it without incident (i.e. without  meeting  anyone)  to  lower  Snowy
Lake where I found a gorgeous site in full view of Tower Mtn to set up  camp
(10 miles, 2700 ft, 4:45 hrs).  Within an hour I  was  ready  to  start  for
Golden Horn.  Passing equally lovely Upper Snowy Lake, I continued  on  easy
open scree and sand, following way trails at times, to the  southeast  ridge
of Golden Horn. Then along the ridge,  past  the  false  summit,  to  circle
around and climb the summit rocks from the west (1800 ft,  1:45  hr).   From
the summit I could see smoke from the nearest fire two drainages  over,  not
close enough to cause me any concern.  A colorful sunset accompanied  me  on
my trip back to camp.

I set out the next morning at 7:30 for Tower Mtn.  The route description  in
Beckey is very accurate, so accurate I can only assume  it  was  written  by
someone who had actually climbed the mountain.  From camp I  made  a  rising
traverse over easy terrain to the talus basin W of the peak, then up a  very
loose broad gully to a notch in the SW ridge.  Scrambling  along  the  ridge
and then on the right side brought me to  the  base  of  the  summit  cliffs
where another gully, marked on the left by a small capstone spire, led  left
through the cliffs to a small notch.  I  descended  slightly  on  the  other
side of the notch and traversed under a cliff band until  I  could  enter  a
steep  gully.   I  followed  this  gully,  which  was  pleasant  class   2-3
scrambling, until stopped by a rock step.  This I turned  by  traversing  to
the right into a groove until I could get back  to  the  main  gully.   More
bedrock scrambling and I was stopped once again by a white wall  just  below
the ridgeline. I exited to the right and  traversed  right  several  hundred
feet on a series of exposed ledges until I could work my way  up  to  the  S
ridge.  What an interesting route this was turning out to  be.   Challenging
but not too difficult if you stayed on route.  At a  few  places  I  had  to
cast around for the easiest way.  I could see  if  you  got  off  route  you
could be in class 4 or even class 5 terrain  very  quickly.    A  few  well-
placed cairns did help along the way.

A short exposed scramble N along the ridge led to the  summit  where  I  was
greeted by a huge cairn and a nice summit register placed in  1995  by  Mike
Torok (1700 ft & 2:20 hr).   I  recognized  a  few  entries  including  Mike
Collins and Mitch Blanton on 8/31/02. But I  had  to  chuckle  at  the  most
recent entry by a fellow who had summitted a  week  earlier.   He  commented
that the forest service should close the PCT more often. Made for much  more
pleasant and less crowded camping at  Snowy  Lakes.   A  fellow  outlaw  and
kindred spirit.

 Careful downclimbing got me back to camp in  2  hours  at  noon.   After  a
pleasant 2 hour rest lounging in the sun, I  began  the  trip  out  reaching
Cutthroat Pass in a little over 2 hours where I was again "legal".   2  more
hours and I was back at the car.  And to think I could have  missed  out  on
this splendid trip if I had paid attention to the signs. 26 miles, 7400  ft,

GILBERT  MTN.  (USGS  Gilbert  Mtn.)  -  Following  the  directions  in   75
Scrambles, I started up the North Creek Trail from  the  end  of  the  Twisp
River Road at 1:00 in a light but steady rain.  I met a  horse  part  coming
out just as I was getting  started.   They  informed  me  that  they  turned
around about half way to North Lake where they  encountered  several  inches
of new snow.  I could tell they thought I was crazy for going  out  in  such
lousy conditions, especially when they learned I was intending to spend  the
night.  By the time I reached North Lake (5 miles, 2250 ft, 3  hrs),  I  was
beginning to think they were right.  It was still  raining,  there  was  now
about 8 inches of wet snow on the ground, I was  quite  wet  and  cold,  and
prospects  for  climbing  my  peak  appeared  dismal.   But  trusting  to  a
favorable forecast for the next day and the fact that it  was  too  late  to
get back to the car before dark anyway, I made camp on a rare bare patch  of
ground under drippy trees and crawled  into  my  sheltering  tent  and  warm
sleeping bag.

 Strong winds and sideways rain and later snow during the night did  nothing
to improve the situation, but I spend a toasty, comfortable  night  sleeping
a solid 12 hours.  Miraculously, I emerged from my tent in  the  morning  to
blue skies and no wind.  Despite much fresh snow on the peak above  me,  how
could I not give it a try?  Thus 8:00 found  me  trudging  around  the  west
side of the lake and up a talus slope until forced to the right  by  cliffs.
Dodging more cliffs, I worked my up and into a large  bowl  below  Gilbert\'s
west ridge.  Snow was now knee deep and since I had no  snowshoes,  progress
slowed.  An easy snow slope led to the  ridge  between  Pts  7483  and  7414
(1600 ft, 2:45 hrs).

Bypassing Pt 7414, I continued up and down along the  pleasant  west  ridge.
Progress was still quite slow due to deep drifted snow in places  and  snow-
covered rocks, but there was little real difficulty until a  dicey  class  3
section along the very spine of the ridge just before the final major  notch
at the base of the summit pyramid.  Now the real scrambling  began,  500  ft
of continuous  class  2-3  made  much  more  difficult  by  the  fresh  snow
covering.  For the most part I stuck to the  crest  of  the  ridge,  despite
advice to leave the crest near the summit in 75 Scrambles.  That advice  was
probably correct as about 100 ft from the top I  found  myself  cliff  bound
above a minor notch.  Somehow I managed to  force  a  tricky  traverse  down
unstable snow on slabby rock to get  around  this  final  obstacle.   A  few
minutes later I was signing the summit register (2550 ft, 5 hrs).

The trip back to camp was much easier as all I  had  to  do  was  follow  my
broken trail, and I reached  my  tent  in  2.5  hours.   A  short  rest  to
recuperate, then 2 more hours on the trail and I was back at  the  car  just
at dark.  14 miles, 5150 ft, - Fay Pullen, Kent, 10/12-13.

SHROUD MTN (USGS Mt Daniel, Scenic)  -  Encouraged  by  the  recent  glowing
report from Mark Owen and a most appropriate name I decided to treat  myself
to this climb for Halloween.  It turned out to be a bit  more  of  a  trick,
not the easy straightforward trip I had in mind.

I began the trip from near the end of the  Tonga  Ridge  Road.   This  road,
although in good shape, is a bit of a pain to drive as it wanders for  miles
on the north side of Tonga Ridge until  finally  ending  in  the  Fisher  Cr
drainage on the east side. Here I took the  little  used  but  good  2  mile
trail to Sawyer Pass.  The temperature at the  start  was  21  degrees  with
several inches of new snow.  More snow at Sawyer Pass made it  difficult  to
find and stay on the way trail to Fisher Lake.  I knew this trail climbed  a
bit onto a flat ridge, then dropped about 300 feet to the lake.  I  guess  I
dropped too much as  I  soon  found  myself  at  Lower  Fisher  Lake.   Lost
already. Not a great start to my climb.

I followed the outlet creek up to Fisher Lake  to  get  back  on  track  and
found the trail to Lower Ptarmigan Lake.  Again I  had  trouble  staying  on
the trail in the snow.  I passed the lake on the  west  shore  over  tedious
and treacherous snow-covered talus then continued up the  inviting  draw  to
Upper Ptarmigan Lake.  Here I encountered foot deep snow.   I  was  slow  to
here and getting slower and I could feel the day slipping away.   I  briefly
considered a direct approach to my peak up through  the  cliffs  surrounding
the  lake,  but  rejected  it  as  too  dangerous  under  the  current  snow
conditions, and instead opted for the much longer but safer route  described
by Mark.

I traversed the north side of the lake, then  worked  my  way  up  and  left
through woods and talus and meadows skirting below cliffs to the broad  5500
ft saddle above Terrace Lakes.  From here I followed the long  SE  ridge  to
the summit.  Although technically an easy ridge I did not find it the  idyll
described by Mark.  What a difference  conditions  can  make.   I  felt  the
pressure of the dwindling day and I continued to  be  slowed  by  the  fresh
snow on sections of talus.  I knew I would be coming out in the dark.

But at last I made the summit at 4:00  PM  and  signed  Mark\'s  new  vitamin
bottle register.  It was sunny on top with nice  views  but  my  thermometer
read 22 degrees.  It was going to be a very cold night.  I  did  not  tarry,
but quickly returned to the saddle, by which time I needed my  headlamp.   I
was able to follow my tracks in the snow  fairly  easily,  although  slowly,
back to Fisher Lake.  Here I tried to find the trail I had lost on  the  way
in.  But there were so many social trails around the lake I finally gave  up
and followed my tracks down to Lower Fisher Lake.

On the map it appeared that if I just contoured north from  the  lower  lake
along a broad flat bench for over a mile, I would eventually hit  the  trail
back to my car.  This appealed much more than following my tracks  some  500
feet uphill to Sawyer Pass.  And so I  wandered  around  in  the  dark  over
trackless terrain for an hour and a half  on  this  Halloween  Eve.   During
this meander it was easy to image all manner of witches and goblins  lurking
behind trees just beyond my headlamp beam and laughing at  me.  But  it  was
not a bad way to spend Halloween. Eventually I did hit the  trail  and  then
the car at 9:30 PM.

November 4, 2003, Mt Morpheus, by Fay Pullen

MT MORPHEUS (USGS Snoqualmie Lk, Lk Philippa) - This is the Home Court  Peak
(5432 ft) between Dream and Anderson Lakes.  From the end of  the  driveable
portion of the North Fork Snoqualmie River Road, where it is washed  out  at
Bear Cr, I began by riding my mountain bike up the road a short 2  miles  to
the old  TH  for  Anderson  Lake.   This  was  a  cold  crisp  morning  with
temperatures in the low 20\'s and a recent light fluffy  snowfall  at  higher
elevations. I continued on foot up the rough eroded  trail  another  long  2
miles to where it breaks out into open meadows for another mile traverse  to
the pass above Anderson Lake.  Here the snow was several inches deep over  a
frozen and icy tread that made the footing very treacherous.

 Crossing the pass (2850 ft &  3  hrs),  I  took  a  welcome  break  in  the
sunshine, then left the trail to make a rising traverse  over  a  series  of
tedious thinly snow-covered talus fields to cross  the  south  ridge  of  Pt
5312 at about 5000ft.  A pleasant contour on  meadowy  south  facing  slopes
below the west ridge of Morpheus followed  until  I  found  myself  directly
below the final summit uplift.  Here I encountered a very  steep,  slippery,
snowy heather gully where bush belays were happily used to  pull  myself  up
to a small notch in the south  ridge.   I  crossed  to  the  east  side  and
continued up slabs to the east ridge, which  was  then  followed  the  short
remaining distance to the summit (3970 ft & 5:45 hrs).

I found no register on top (although a small one could have been  buried  in
some crevice and snow-covered), so I left one.  The  day,  though  freezing,
was windless and the sunshine warm so I  lingered  a  while  on  top  before
beginning the descent.  I made it back to  the  pass  and  the  trail  in  a
little over 2 hours, just at dusk.  Here  I  donned  both  headlamp  and  my
small 6-point crampons (not instep, which I don\'t like, these crampons  only
cover the front half of the boot) for the icy descent  down  the  trail.   I
reached the TH 2 hours later for the frigid blast down  to  the  car  on  my
bike.  15 miles, 4400 ft, 10:45 hrs, - Fay Pullen, Kent, 11/4.

     November 6-7, 2003, Loowit Trail (Mt St Helens), by Fay Pullen


  Loowit Trail, Mt St Helens (Greentrails Mt St Helens NW # 364S) - And now
  for something different for me - not a summit but a trail trip,  although
  a very rugged trail, especially this time of year.


  I have always been fascinated with Mt St Helens, from the  first  time  I
  climbed her beautiful symmetrical  dome  many  years  ago  to  subsequent
  ascents up to a greatly altered post-eruption crater rim. So the  thought
  of circumnavigating the mountain on the Loowit Trail was  very  appealing
  and something I wanted to do every since I learned that a trail had  been
  "constructed" across the blast zone completing the  circle.   Be  advised
  that this trail is only shown on later versions of the Greentrails map or
  on the 1998 Geo-Graphics National Monument map.


  I arrived at the Climber\'s Bivouac trailhead, on the south  side  of  the
  mountain, at 11:00 amid much traffic from elk hunters, and started up the
  Ptarmigan Trail at 11:30 with several inches of well-trodden snow on  the
  ground.  The day was  fairly  warm  and  sunny,  but  a  stiff  wind  was
  worrisome. I soon reached the Loowit Trail (2.1 miles, 960 ft, 1 hr)  and
  turned right.  All footprints stopped and I was now making fresh  tracks.
  I was surprised at the loveliness of this first section  that  showed  no
  signs of the violent 1980 eruption.  It  was  open  meadowy  terrain  and
  looked very friendly. Much of the snow had melted  on  the  south  facing
  sunny slopes and a gorgeous view of Mt  Adams  was  dead  ahead.   I  was
  feeling inspired and all misgivings about doing this trip so late in  the
  year vanished.  I felt I would have no trouble making my destination  for
  the day - the Plains of Abraham just below  Windy  Pass,  some  10  miles
  distant. Little did I know!


  Soon I left the friendly sunny slopes,  entered  woods  where  the  light
  fluffy snow was calf deep, and began a 1300 ft descent to June Lake.  The
  trail switch backed down to Swift Cr then climbed up to  cross  the  Worm
  Flow lava field.  Here there was essentially no trail, just large  wooden
  poles stuck in the rock to follow, slow and tedious.  I was beginning  to
  lose my optimism that I would make my camp before nightfall.


  I passed the June Lake Trail at 2:15 (5.2 miles, 1140 ft, 2:45 hrs), then
  gradually climbed  to  regain  all  the  lost  elevation,  first  through
  meadows, then switch backing up a rocky ridge and beginning a long up and
  down traverse across many ravines on the east side of the mountain.  Here
  the snow deepened, in places drifted a foot or more.  The crossings  also
  showed the effects of the heavy rains of mid-October, which  washed  away
  the tread in many places.  Some were quite challenging as I scrambled  up
  and down the loose eroded rock.  Slowed even more, I was  now  certain  I
  would not make my destination before dark (5:00 this time of year).


  Somewhere along this section  I  was  astonished  to  come  upon  a  long
  abandoned mountain bike!  I was surprised to  learn  that  many  sections
  (except the restricted area) of the  Loowit  Trail  were  open  to  these
  machines.  This seemed crazy to me as the trail is too rough for them and
  they would have to be carried over many obstacles.   I  guess  one  rider
  agreed with my assessment and just abandoned his bike.

     I reached the Ape Canyon Trail at 5:00 (9.9 miles, 2800 ft,  5:30  hrs)
  where I ran into fresh mountain bike tracks in the snow.  This had to  be
  one tough biker. The snow here was wind crusted  and  must  have  been  a
  chore to ride or push through. I followed these tracks onto the Plains of
  Abraham and I must admit they were very helpful in allowing me to stay on
  course by just the light of an almost full moon.  This  trek  across  the
  flat open plains by moonlight was sheer  magic.  I  reached  the  Abraham
  trail at 6:00 where the tracks and I parted company.


  I was now on my own finding the way.  There  were  fewer  cairns  than  I
  expected and I soon lost the trail, but I could see  Windy  Pass  in  the
  distance and so just headed for it.  The wind was now  getting  to  be  a
  real problem on this open unprotected plain, but it was at my back  so  I
  was able to keep going.  There was supposed to be  a  water  source  just
  below Windy Pass, and this was where I had intended to camp.  But  I  had
  crossed no water in any of the previous ravines and  I  found  none  here
  either.  I guess the summer had been too dry.  I  was  getting  a  little
  desperate now.  No water and the wind was a real concern.  I had to  find
  a sheltered spot to camp soon.


  Forced by the wind to continue, I soon found myself at Windy  Pass.   One
  book I read had suggested camping at Windy Pass.  Where they got the idea
  that this was a possibility is beyond me.  It is called Windy Pass for  a
  reason and I doubt that there are many days per year when the wind  isn\'t
  blowing.  This night it was blowing so hard that I literally had to crawl
  the last bit to avoid being knocked off my feet.  The wind had to  be  in
  excess of 60 mph.


  I was really desperate now.  I had to get out of the  wind.   There  were
  several signs at the pass but I couldn\'t hang around long enough to  read
  them.  I can only assume they were informing me that I was  now  entering
  the restricted zone and that leaving the  trail  and  camping  were  both
  forbidden.  Well I had no choice.  At least  I  only  broke  one  of  the
  rules.  I went down the other side in knee-deep drifted snow  far  enough
  to get out of the worse of the wind and set up my tent  on  a  flat  spot
  next to the trail.  I rationalized I wasn\'t doing any harm as I camped on
  snow.  I gratefully crawled into the shelter of my  tent  at  7:00  (12.5
  miles, 3800 ft, 7:30 hrs) and spent the next 2 hours laboriously  melting
  powder snow for water in a tiny pot.


  The wind soon increased in intensity even  in  my  "sheltered"  spot  and
  raged all night long keeping me awake worrying if  I  would  be  able  to
  continue my trip or even reverse it  and  retreat.   Things  deteriorated
  even more when it began to snow  towards  morning.   Since  I  was  awake
  anyway, I began preparing breakfast at 4:30 AM. At first light I  emerged
  from my tent anticipating the worst and a  hasty  retreat.   Much  to  my
  surprise conditions were not that bad.  Visibility was good (although the
  top of the mountain was in fog), the wind had  lessened  just  enough  to
  allow movement and the snow  flurries  were  minor.   So  6:30  found  me
  continuing on my way, the wind still at my back.


  I was now in the no man\'s land of the blast zone - stark,  desolate,  and
  monochromatic.  Surely nothing could live in this barren  landscape.  Yet
  on closer inspection, here and there  a  lone  seedling  could  be  found
  struggling  to  grow  in  the  lee  of  a  boulder.   And  the  snow  was
  crisscrossed with the tracks of Elk, although I never saw one.  Nature is
  remarkable resilient. Under the conditions I was barely  able  to  follow
  the trail. Every hollow and depression was filled with drifted snow.  But
  exposed areas and ridges were wind blasted free of snow. Whenever  I  was
  uncertain where the trail went I would stop  and  look  in  the  distance
  until I could locate a cairn or section of visible tread.  I  passed  the
  Windy Trail at 6:55 and the Loowit Falls Trail at 7:25 then descended 600
  feet down the poorly marked Sasquatch Steps to the Willow  Springs  Trail
  at 7:45.




  I now began a long mostly flat traverse of the  Pumice  Plains  across  a
  moonscape of utter desolation. There was less snow  down  here  but  that
  didn\'t help much in finding the trail, which was mostly  nonexistent  and
  only marked with small hard to follow cairns.  There was no tread.   Much
  of the way showed new signs of erosion from the recent rains.  I  had  to
  chuckle at the rule of not straying off  the  trail  in  this  restricted
  area.  It was impossible to stay on the  "trail".  As  I  worked  my  way
  around the north side of the mountain I could look directly up  into  the
  breach of the crater, and I felt I was getting more  of  a  sense  of  St
  Helens than I  ever  got  from  just  climbing  to  the  crater  rim.   I
  thoroughly enjoyed this section, which had its own haunting beauty.


  I crossed Studebaker Ridge at 9:30 (5.4 miles, 950 ft, 3 hrs from  camp).
  I was soon out of the worst of the blast zone  and  entered  an  area  of
  growing trees on the west side of the mountain.   More  deep  snow,  more
  ravines to cross, a section of eerie standing dead forest  and  then  the
  1000-foot descent to the South Fork Toutle River.  Here I was  struck  by
  the carpets of brilliant yellow-green moss, in colorful contrast  to  the
  muted colors of the blast zone.  I completely lost the trail in the river
  bottom, so crossed at a likely spot on boulders and headed uphill on  the
  other side until I hit a trail.  It wasn\'t until I had contoured on  this
  trail for over a mile, when I knew I should be climbing steeply,  that  I
  figured out I had gotten on the Toutle Trail instead of the Loowit Trail.
   Darn! I didn\'t even know that trail existed, as it  didn\'t  show  on  my
  Greentrails map.  Not to worry.  I  soon  intersected  the  Sheep  Canyon
  Trail and followed it uphill 1300 feet to  once  again  gain  the  Loowit
  (12.1 miles, 3000 ft, 7 hrs).


  I felt most of my problems were now over.  I was sheltered from the  wind
  on this side, the sun was out and good trail, I thought, should lead  the
  rest of the way.  But the mountain wasn\'t through with  me  yet.  I  soon
  came to a huge ravine.  The original trail had completely washed away and
  to get across I had to descend 300 feet on a detour trail.   Bad  enough.
  But when crossing the bed of the ravine  I  was  confronted  by  a  newly
  formed 10-foot vertical wall.  More evidence of the  recent  flooding.  I
  could have used an ice ax to chop steps up the crumbly rock surface,  but
  I didn\'t have one with me.  So I scratched and clawed my way up the  wall
  and wearily climbed back up the 300 feet to the original trail.


  Good trail through pleasant meadows did lead to the Butte Trail at  3:15.
  There were a few more minor ravines to cross, then the final obstacle  of
  the Swift Creek Lava Flow where wooden poles again marked the  route.   I
  hit the Ptarmigan Trail at 4:45 just as the light was fading and made  it
  to the car without needing a headlamp at 5:30 (19.5 miles,  4000  ft,  11
  hrs).

Burntboot Pk (USGS Big Snow  Mtn)  -  The  good  news  is  the  Middle  Fork
Snoqualmie River Road is in good shape to  the  Taylor  River  bridge  -  it
appears to have been recently graded.  The bad news is the  road  from  that
point on is as bad as ever and a real pain to drive.  It took me about  1.5
hours to drive this 13 mile section.  A 4X4 is a real asset here.

I followed the route description by Carl Dreisbach in The Middle Fork  Guide
rather than that by Beckey, or at  least  I  tried  to.   Leaving  from  the
parking lot at the end of the road  at  10:20,  I  immediately  crossed  the
Middle Fork River.  This was no problem  this  time  of  year  in  this  dry
summer and I was able to cross  by  rock  hopping.   On  the  other  side  I
climbed  up  a  small  talus  slope  until  it  ended,  then  floundered  in
horrendous brush for an hour trying to traverse left  to  a  shallow  gully.
At times I had no idea where I was going.  Eventually I  reached  the  gully
where the going was tolerable up the rocky bed.  Soon I  was  stopped  by  a
rock step some 50 ft high that I surmounted by  doing  pull-ups  on  hanging
brush to the right.  This first part was the hardest part of the whole  trip
and took close to 2 hours.

Once back in the gully bed above the step, the going, though still  somewhat
brushy, was easier.  The gully slanted left following along  under  a  cliff
to the right.  Near the top of the cliff I was  able  to  enter  forest  and
gradually work my way up gentler terrain to open  heather  slopes  and  then
talus under the north face of  the  peak.  Impressive  views  opened  up  of
Chimney Rock  and  Overcoat.   Following  at  the  base  of  the  cliffs,  I
traversed east to the major gully on the NE side and up its  loose  rock  to
just below the summit ridge.  Here a really nifty ledge led  left  across  a
smooth slab to  the  ridge  just  below  the  summit.   This  ledge,  though
exposed, was a delight to climb.  A short final scramble put me  on  top  at
3:20.

The summit was marked by a large cairn, to which I added a register.   After
a 35-minute rest, I took the short walk to the  west  peak,  then  found  an
easier way down into the gully than the exposed ledge.  Once back  into  the
woods, I wandered around a bit staying on course to the lower gully where  a
rappel was needed to descend the rock step.  I followed the  gully  down  as
far as possible but did no better in avoiding brush  than  on  the  way  up.
There was no help for it and I again spent an hour crashing the awful  stuff
until emerging on the bank of the river at dusk.

     EVERGREEN MTN (USGS Evergreen Mtn) - I drove up Rapid River Road 6530

After about 45 minutes and 850 ft of gain I hit an old abandoned logging
road (shown on the USGS map) that greatly facilitated travel.  I followed
this old road, then the ridgeline and an occasional flag another hour or
so, gradually encountering snow, to emerge on the main Evergreen Mtn road
(2000 ft, 2 hrs).  Here I stopped to put on snowshoes as the snow was
turning soft and slushy.  I continued up the gentle ridge, cutting the
switchback, then followed the road to its end at the Evergreen Mtn TH.  An
attractive open ridge led steeply up past a minor wooded bump to the main
corniced summit ridge and the lookout (4300 ft 4:15 hrs).

     No views were in evidence as I was now in dense fog, nor could I find
a way into the lookout, so I didn\'t hang around long on the summit.  On the
way down the snow was very slushy tending to sluff off and my snowshoes
were not holding well.  So, not wanting to go sliding off into oblivion, I
postholed knee deep down the steepest section of the ridge until the angle
slacked off.  I made it back to the car without further mishap. 9 miles,

      ARROWHEAD  MTN  (USGS  Mt  Howard)  -  No  logging  roads  approaching
Arrowhead showed on any map I had, but as I drove east from Stevens  Pass  I
could see a road switchbacking high  on  the  NW  slope  of  mountain.   So,
parking just past the RR underpass at a nice wide turnout, I crossed the  RR
tracks and powerline and just headed uphill, carrying my skis, until  I  hit
the road.  I then skied up this good snow  covered  road  for  a  couple  of
miles until it ended in a clearcut at about 4600 ft.   I  continued  up  the
left side of the clearcut, crossing the creek, entered the gentle  woods  at
the top and traversed left to the base of a steep open  slope.   This  slope
would be suspect  with  unstable  snow,  but  today  things  were  firm  and
avalanche danger low, so I climbed up and right onto  the  summit  ridge  at
5500 ft.  Here I left the skis and booted up the remaining 600 ft along  the
easy ridge to the summit (3300 ft, 3 hrs).

    I lingered on the summit enjoying the views on this clear sunny day  and
even took the time to sketch a picture of Big Chiwaukum.  I  managed  a  few
good turns in the softening snow of the open slopes  before  the  quick  ski
down the easy road.  The only unpleasantness was the very last bit  carrying
skis back down the patchy snow from the logging road to the car.

     RED MTN, WEST PK (USGS Mt Phelps,  Grotto)  -  The  Money  Cr  Road  is
closed by a big washout  2.5  miles  from  the  bridge  over  Money  Cr.   I
started from here by bike but was only able to get  0.75  mile  farther  before
being  stopped  by  snow.   I  continued  on  skis,   enduring   the   usual
intermittent snow patches of spring melting  patterns,  for  a  mile  or  so
before hitting consistent snow.  I was using skis fitted with Pika  bindings
that allow for the use of climbing boots.   These  bindings  are  heavy  and
clumsy but are adequate for plodding up logging roads.

     The weather was unsettled with off and on  heavy  showers,  so  by  the
time I reached Lake Elizabeth, some 4 miles up the road, I was beginning  to
get wet.   I followed the road a little past the lake to the divide  between
Money Cr and the S Fork Tolt R where I  stashed  the  skis.   The  rain  was
beginning to change to wet snow.  From the divide I  descended  slightly  to
cross a marshy area, then headed straight uphill into  the  woods  following
alongside a gully to a saddle in the ridge  E  of  Crater  Lk.   This  route
seemed preferable to me than contouring around the  ridge  directly  to  the
lake.

     From the saddle it was a long contour between  4000  and  42000  ft  on
steep wooded slopes around the lake basin  until  I  could  begin  ascending
directly toward the West Pk.  Two days earlier I had  tried  this  route  in
similar miserable conditions,  but  due  to  uncertainty  where  I  was  and
wishful thinking (i.e.  lousy  routefinding)  went  up  too  soon  following
inviting terrain and found myself on Pt 5139, actually a  very  nice  little
summit but not where I wanted to be.  Due to time constraints I had to  call
it a day, although it looked as if the ridge could be traversed to the  West
Pk.  So this time I knew to hold to the contour longer, and after  about  an
hour from the saddle entered pleasant open slopes leading upward.

     It was now snowing seriously, there was about  a  foot  of  accumulated
fresh snow and I was postholing knee deep through that  and  the  underlying
old wet stuff.  Snowshoes would have been the order of the  day  but  I  had
elected not to carry them all this distance.  So I paid the  price  for  not
having them as I punched my way slowly upward.  Occasionally the snow  would
stop for brief clearing and views.  I could see Pt 5139 that I  had  climbed
2 days earlier.  I hit the S ridge  above  the  saddle  with  Pt  5331,  and
easily followed it to the snowy summit (3860 ft, 5:45 hrs).   No  views  now
and no chance to either find or leave a register.  Too much snow.  Darn!

     The snow was too wet and soft for glissading, but  postholing  downhill
is still faster than uphill.  I followed my tracks all the way  back  to  my
skis making it in a little over 1.75  hours.  The ski back down the road  was
slow in the wet slushy snow but still preferable to walking or  snowshoeing,
and I made it back to the car before  dark.   It  even  quit  raining  which
allowed me to dry out slightly.

Big Chiwaukum (USGS Chiwaukum Mtn) - This was  my  second  attempt  on  this
peak this year.  My first attempt was May 30-June1. On  that  trip  I  tried
first from up the NW ridge but  weird  unconsolidated  snow  that  made  for
insecure stepkicking and icy rock made the upper traverse too hazardous  for
me.  I then descended about 1500 feet  and  traversed  to  try  from  the SW
side.  This time I got to the false summit, but again  snow  conditions  and
ice stopped me. I spent a tense hour  trying  to  traverse  into  the  gully
leading to the summit feeling at any moment the snow might peel away and  me
with it. I finally gave up because even if I made it to the  gully  I  would
never be able to climb the final iced up rock. This dual  sided  attempt  so
wore me out that I spent a second night in camp and my planned two day  trip
turned into a three day one.
 
I didn\'t get to my second try until September. At least I  thought  the  ice
and snow would surely be gone. Yeah, right! Rain and a snow  level  of  6500
ft were predicted for that night, but I felt  I  could  sneak  my  climb  in
before that happened.  As it turned out, I found myself  climbing  the  peak
during the worse possible weather window.
 
I followed the Whitepine Tr, then Wildhorse Tr to  the  large  meadow  below
the W side of the mountain and found a nice campsite  several  hundred  feet
above the trail at 5750 ft. (6.5 miles, 3400 ft and  4  hours  to  here).  I
quickly set up camp then started for the peak at 4:15  pm.  I  could  see  a
storm brewing off in the direction of the Enchantments and heading  my  way.
The weather was coming in sooner than predicted.  Boy, you never  can  trust
those weathermen!  But my peak was still clear so I  continued  on,  gaining
elevation at a good pace aided by my previous experience with the  route.  I
headed up alongside a gully into an  upper  rocky  basin,  trending  to  the
right, to avoid cliffs, as I climbed. Then up a grassy gully onto scree  and
talus slopes, followed by a traverse left just below the S  ridgeline.  This
is where the weather broke  and  it  began  to  thunder  and  hail.  It  was
actually quite beautiful and exciting, but it  was  really  not  good  being
this high in a thunder storm.  However, the thunder seemed  to  stay  mostly
over the Enchantments so I continued on. I traversed under the false  summit
recognizing the high point of my previous attempt.  What had taken  an  hour
then, I easily passed in a few minutes on sandy ledges. Now the  interesting
rockwork began. I entered the gully, climbed to the top  and  exited  at  an
exposed notch onto a ledge which I followed to a  series  of  ramps  to  the
pointed summit arriving at 6:15 (2770 ft and 2 hours).

The weather was now getting positively  awful,  the  hail  changing  to  wet
sticky snow with thickening fog.  I quickly signed the register and  beat  a
hasty retreat. Descending the now snowy rock was a trial and my hands  froze
trying to find holds. Once off the rock, I breathed a sigh  of  relief,  but
with visibility now down to a hundred feet or so I  had  to  stay  alert  to
find the route back down.  Fortunately I had taken the  trouble  to  mark  a
few waypoints with my GPS on the way up, so I didn\'t go  completely  astray.
(The trouble with waypoints is they tell you where you want to  go  but  not
exactly how to get there.) The scree and  talus  now  had  a  layer  of  wet
slippery snow, and  the  descent  was  definitely  of  the  slip  and  slide
variety. Darkness descended upon me before I got completely down. I made  it
to the upper basin O.K., but missed the easy gully to the lower one with  my
camp.  I  got  completely  confused  and   nothing   seemed   familiar   (no
intermediate waypoints here, just one for  camp).   I  ended  up  slithering
down wet mossy rock on a  steep  hillside,  then  blindly  followed  my  GPS
through awful wet brush and several bogs back to my tent at  8:45  (Yes,  it
took me longer to go down than up). If not for my GPS I would have  wandered
around all night looking for my camp.

I awoke the next morning to much improved  weather,  although  my  peak  was
still in the fog and everything was very wet.  Oh  well,  you  can\'t  always
time things just right. Before heading out,  I  decided  to  add  Frosty  Pk
(6489) to my Backcourt checklist. Frosty turned out to  an  easy  hike  from
Frosty Pass (7 miles, 2750 ft, 4:30 hrs RT from camp). I was  back  in  camp
by 1:45 and ready for the trip out by 3:15, reaching the  car  at  6:15.  23
miles and 10,100 ft total for the trip.  Fay Pullen, 9/6-7/02

Mt Buckner, Mt Booker ( USGS Cascade Pass, Goode Mtn) - I was really  helped
on this one by Stefan Feller\'s  recent  trip  report.  First  it  helped  me
decide to approach  Horseshoe Basin via the lower basin  rather  than  going
over Sahale Arm.  I didn\'t like the  idea  of  descending  such  treacherous
terrain with a full pack alone. Second it caused me to add Mt Booker,  which
sounded interesting, to the itinerary.  I toyed with the idea of also  doing
Horseshoe Pk when I learned it was on the 100  Highest  List,  but  I  would
make that decision when I actually saw the peak.

I started up the Casade Pass trail at 10:00 and reached the pass  at  11:45.
I was minding my  own  business,  resting  and  having  a  snack,  when  the
Ubiquitous Park Ranger descended upon me  demanding  to  know  where  I  was
going.  "Horseshoe Basin", I replied.  "There is  no  camping  in  Horseshoe
Basin," he answered belligerently.  "What!" I said.  "I  have  a  permit  to
camp there." "Impossible," he said. "Let me see your  permit.   Oh  this  is
for the Mt Buckner XC zone." "Does that  not  include  Horseshoe  Basin?"  I
said. "How are you going in?" He said.   "From  lower  Horseshoe  Basin",  I
said. " Past the waterfalls?" he grilled.  "Yes" I replied beginning to  get
rather annoyed. "What is the problem  here?  I  have  my  permit.  I  am  an
experienced climber. Why am  I  getting  the  third  degree?"  (I  was  also
thinking I was climbing mountains before this guy was  born!)  "Most  people
are not able to find the way  from  Lower  to  Upper  Horseshoe  Basin."  He
continued. At this point we were getting an audience  of  other  hikers  and
things were beginning to get embarrassing.  Even the  ranger\'s  partner  was
looking a little red in the face.  Eventually it dawned on  Mr  Ranger  that
he was coming on a bit strong and that maybe I was  a  reasonably  competent
climber despite my diminutive appearance and  there  was  no  call  for  his
attitude. To his credit, as we sorted things out, the ranger  did  apologize
at length, but it did not make the bad feeling go away.  I do  realize  that
rangers have to deal with a lot  of  idiots,  but  this  guy  was  seriously
lacking in people skills and I feel like I was a victim of "profiling" -   a
little old gray-haired lady couldn\'t possibly make it to Horseshoe Basin.

Pondering this unpleasant encounter, I continued down the  other  side  from
Cascade Pass, some 3 very hot miles to a junction with the  Horseshoe  Basin
trail, then 1.5 miles up into the lower basin.  This  route  was  worth  the
extra effort just to see this gorgeous cliff rimmed cirque with  its  dozens
of gushing waterfalls. But getting past the rim to the upper basin would  be
no easy matter. I chose to go up left of  the  Black  Warrior  mine,  as  it
looked shorter and less brushy and because crossing Basin Cr  to  the  right
looked a challenge.  But I did make a mental note of  a  possible  route  to
the right.

A snow slope took me part way up past the mine.  Then slabs,  a  steep  dirt
gully, some thick cedar scrub and finally open easy terrain  brought  me  to
the slopes directly below the route from Sahale Arm.   Looking  up  at  that
route, I was doubly glad I hadn\'t come in that way.   It  looked  wicked.  A
long traverse over talus, crossing myriad creeks, and I  found  a  wonderful
campsite just past the Big Cable on a heathery bench  at  5900  ft  directly
below Mt Buckner (9.5 miles, 4100 ft, 6.5 hrs).  It was  now  4:30.   I  was
too tired and it was too late to try for Booker today, my original plan.  So
I relaxed in my gorgeous surroundings, ate and rehydrated all afternoon  and
turned in early.

The route up Buckner the next morning was  straightforward  and  obvious.  A
short ways up I ran into old tracks in the snow traversing higher  from  the
Sahale Arm route and I followed these the rest of  the  way  to  the  summit
(3200 ft, 3.5 hrs). What glorious views from the top.  It  was  almost  more
than one could absorb. On the way up I was checking out Horseshoe Pk  but  I
had trouble seeing anything that looked as if it had 400 ft  of  prominence.
Because I wasn\'t  quite  sure  which  pinnacle  was  Horseshoe  and  because
everything on Ripsaw Ridge looked wicked, but mostly  just  because  I  just
didn\'t feel in the mood for anything that committing,  I  decided  to  forgo
that peak and try for Booker instead.  Even though it was now  11:00  and  I
knew it would be a very long day, and I would get out after dark, I  thought
I could still do it. Amazing what a good night\'s sleep will do for  you.  So
after descending from Buckner, I started a downward traverse  toward  Booker
at 7200 ft.  Stefan\'s route description  helped  greatly  and  prevented  me
from making the mistake of following Becky.  I crossed the rib at  6600  ft,
followed the gully then snow to the Buckner-Booker saddle,  went  up  to  pt
7840, dropped down the other side, traversed beneath cliffs  until  directly
below the summit, then up a snow finger and class 3 rock. Stefan  was  right
- it is a long way.  I made it to Booker\'s summit at 2:45 and back  to  camp
at 5:15, running into two goats on the way. (5700 ft, 10.5 hrs both  peaks).


I now had to hustle to make it  to  easy  terrain  before  dark.  I  quickly
packed up and was ready to head down at  6:15.  I  didn\'t  relish  the  long
traverse across the upper basin back to my ascent route.   Becky  made  some
vague reference to crossing Basin Cr in  the  lower  basin,  going  E  until
finding the Big Cable and following it to  the  upper  basin.   I  foolishly
thought I could reverse this and follow the  cable  downhill.   You\'d  think
that by now I would know better than to rely on Becky\'s vague directions.

 I was able to follow the cable  downhill  several  hundred  feet  until  it
disappeared over the rocky rim right  next  to  a  roaring  waterfall.   Too
scary for me.  On to Plan B.  My memory of looking up to the E of the  Black
Warrior Mine assured me there was a feasible  route  here,  so  I  headed  E
along the rim, passing the remains of two log  structures  and  more  mining
debris.  Then I slithered down awful thick scrub cedar until  I  could  work
my way over to the easier terrain I had seen from  below.   I  actually  ran
into a few bits of scattered flagging and even what looked  like  occasional
tread of an old trail, but for the most part a well used route  was  not  to
be found. I don\'t think many people approach Upper Horseshoe Basin from  the
lower one.  Most must go over Sahale Arm. Anyway, I found a  reasonable  way
down.  All that remained was to find a way across Basin  Creek,  no  trivial
matter. The area below the mine was  a  massive  snow  avalanche  deposition
zone. The snow was probably 20-30 deep, with huge moats and scary  crevasses
and gushing water underneath.  I was lucky to  find  a  collapsed  ice  wall
that offered a mostly safe passage across the  snow  to  the  trail  on  the
other side.

It was now 7:45.  All that remained was to follow the trail out.  I  dragged
my tired body up the 1800 ft to Cascade Pass  before  needing  my  headlamp,
then down the other side staggering into the TH at midnight.  No  Ubiquitous
Ranger at this hour.  Even he must sleep. 28 miles and 11,700 ft  gain.  Fay

Robinson Mtn (USGS Robinson Mtn) - For our annual overnight  trip  together,
this year my son wanted to go to the  Pasayten  Wilderness,  an  area  where
neither of us had previously  been.  Given  that,  I  chose  Robinson  as  a
desirable objective. We started up the Robinson Pass trail  (elev  2600)  at
2:45, pretty good for my son considering the long drive. The  day  was  warm
and sunny and the trail dusty from much horse traffic. Just past Beauty  Cr,
we picked up the unmarked trail  that  climbed  alongside  the  creek.  This
rough trail was easy to follow, helped by signs of recent horse  traffic.  I
didn\'t know you could get horses up such steep trails. But they  had  really
chewed up  the steeper sections.

 As we rounded the hillside into the upper valley, we  heard  several  rifle
shots. So much for solitude. After crossing many rockslides,  then  a  small
creek, we broke out into open meadow  (2600  ft,  4  hrs).  Sitting  in  the
meadow,  glassing  the  opposite  hillside  were  two  hunters.   They  were
friendly enough but they were occupying the  campsite  (elev  5200)  we  had
hoped to use. This is when we learned that the high hunt started  on  Sunday
(this was Friday). They had been brought in  by  packers  (hence  the  horse
traffic) and were staying the entire 10 days of the hunt.  I  guess  serious
hunters stake out their territory early. The rifle shots heard  earlier  was
one of them shooting at a bear who caught them offguard.  (Bear  season  was
already open.) Happily they missed.  We  had  a  nice  chat  and  they  even
offered to share their campsite  with  us,  but  we  declined.  They  seemed
genuinely concerned that we wouldn\'t be able to find a place to camp  as  it
was now getting late (6:45). I pointed out that there was  a  good  site  at
the tarn  at the base of Robinson if we had time to get to it, or  at  least
in the woods below. They replied they had  tramped  all  over  the  hillside
above and there was no tarn up there or even any  level  spots.   We  parted
with them shaking their heads with disbelief at those crazy climbers and  us
wondering why hunters can\'t read maps, or if they even have them.

We headed up the  initially  steep  meadow,  climbing  alongside  the  small
creek.  I didn\'t want to get far from that creek as finding water  could  be
a problem this time of year. The map indicated a  flattening  of  the  slope
and a possible place to camp at 6000 ft and  sure  enough  in  fading  light
(7:30) we came upon a wonderful spot, complete with  an  old  fire  ring,  a
level, rockless tent site and a great view out over Beauty Cr  valley  (4.5
miles, 3400 ft and 4 3/4 hrs). The creek was still nearby for water. I  made
dinner that balmy night by the light of a gorgeous moon and stars.

We started for Robinson the next day at  8:30  reaching  the  lovely  little
tarn at 9:00.  Looking at the rocky shoreline we were happy  we  had  camped
where we did.  From the tarn we climbed  to a  small  moraine  ridge  above,
then up talus and loose scree into a gully on the left. The  upper  part  of
the gully was very loose and unpleasant and we had  to  be  careful  not  to
knock rocks down on each other. The top of the gully  (elev  7400  ft)  gave
access to the long SE ridge of  Robinson.  It  was  now  a  matter  of  just
following this ridge N and W , first  on  the  crest,  then  sidehilling  on
scree past several bumps.  Climber and goat trails would come and  go.  Just
before the last false summit, some real  scrambling  began,  first  a  short
section down and around a rib into a gully.  Then up the gully to the  notch
above and a short exposed but easy scramble on the narrow ridge to a  survey
marker. The last bit was a simple walk on  talus  to  the  summit  at  12:30
(2700 ft and 4 hrs).

The views were lovely, but I had difficulty recognizing anything.  This  was
all virgin territory for me.  Great  possibilities  for  future  trips.   We
spent a pleasant, warm and mostly windless hour on the  summit.   I  left  a
large register before leaving.  I was surprised there was none there.

We left the ridge earlier than on the way up to avoid the awful  gully,  but
I don\'t think we gained much, descending steep loose  scree  slopes  farther
upvalley. Nearing the tarn we were surprised to be  greeted  by  a  friendly
black lab and her owner, a lone woman from Winthrop. She was camped  at  the
tarn and planned on climbing Robinson tomorrow with a friend who was  coming
up for the day (he didn\'t like to camp).  She had been  up  Robinson  before
so knew what to expect.  Her dog was a good scrambler.  She too had met  the
hunters below who once again insisted there was no tarn up here.  We  had  a
good chuckle over that.

We got back to the tent at 4:00 and left at 5:30.  We ran into  the  hunters
again on the trip out. They had been worried about us but  we  assured  them
we had found a comfortable campsite.  Then they asked if we were  going  out
that night, commenting that it was already 6:00. Certainly, I replied.   All
we had to do was get to the  main  trail  and  walk  out  by  headlamp.   No
problem.  Climbers do it all the time. Again we  parted  with  them  shaking
their heads at those crazy climbers.

We hit the Robinson creek trail at dusk (7:30) and walked the  rest  of  the
way out by headlamp.  There was one  unanticipated  problem  though.   There
had been even further horse traffic since yesterday, and the trail  was  now
ankle deep in dust.  We had to walk several  hundred  feet  apart  to  avoid
kicking up dust for each  other  and  even  then,  the  dust  we  kicked  up
ourselves was at times so thick  visibility  was  clouded  by  headlamp  and
breathing difficult.  But we survived  and  reached  the  TH  at  9:00.  The
parking lot was absolutely jammed with horse trailers!  14  miles  and  6200

   Day 1 - With this plan in mind I started up the West Fork Tr at 10:30 on
   a sunny but cool morning.  There were two large horse  trailers  in  the
   parking lot and evidence on the trail of recent horse  traffic.  I  just
   hoped this horse party wasn\'t camped at Star Lake,  my  destination  for
   the day. About eight miles in and  a  mile  before  Fish  Cr  Pass,  the
   terrain opened up with gorgeous golden alpine larches everywhere and the
   sheer N cliffs of Star Pk looming above to the left. From Fish Cr Pass I
   descended a short distance to lovely Star  Lake  and  found  a  pleasant
   campsite nestled amongst the rocks at the N end (9 miles, 3600 ft and 4.5
   hrs). Much to my happiness, I was all alone at the lake.


   After setting up camp, I set off to climb Star Pk at 3:40. I  worked  my
   way up through larch groves S of the lake, then meadow and talus to pick
   up a way trail leading to the SW ridge  above.  It  was  then  a  simple
   matter to follow the ridge, or to the right of it, on talus all the  way
   to the easy summit. I was back in camp by 6:00, much sooner than  I  had
   expected (RT 1550 ft and 2:20 hr). I ate  dinner  watching  a  beautiful
   sunset (caused by approaching weather and clouds) reflected in the lake.
   That night was quite windy but warm.


   Day 2 - I began this day at 7:00 by climbing back up  to  Fish  Cr  Pass
   where I was treated to stunning views of miles of golden alpine  larches
   glowing in the early morning sun. The threatened storm of  the  previous
   night had fizzled out. From the pass I followed the easy ridge NW to the
   summit of Courtney Pk (8392) (1235 ft and 1 hr).  The  route  from  here
   followed the long curving ridge all the way to Oval Pk.


   From Courtney, I descended talus NE down to the saddle at 7680  ft  then
   back up to the summit of Buttermilk Ridge (8267) (1840 ft  and  2:15  hr
   cumulative), enjoying the view down to Oval Lakes on the way. Down again
   to 7700 ft then following the ridge to Pt 7978.  Here  I  descended  the
   cliffy NW side with some steep downclimbing, then traversed directly  to
   the Oval Pk saddle  at  7580,  rather  than  lose  excess  elevation  by
   descending the NE side as described in  75  Scrambles.   Rather  tedious
   talus led up to Oval Pk at 12:00 (3300 ft and 4:50).


   From Oval\'s summit I started back by going straight down more  talus  SE
   to the basin below, heading for a large tarn at 6936 ft. I  was  getting
   mighty tired of talus hopping. Once in the  basin,  I  wandered  through
   meadows and larch groves until I came out at the tarn.  Here I picked up
   an abandoned trail on  the  S  shore.   This  trail  was  fairly  easily
   followed back to the main trail about 1 mile below Fish Cr  Pass.   Just
   before hitting the main trail I  startled  a  magnificent  big  buck.  I
   wished him luck in the coming hunting season. On the climb  back  up  to
   the pass I met the horse party belonging  to  the  trailers  at  the  TH
   heading out.  We had a nice chat.  They  had  camped  much  farther  in.
   There were about 8 horses total, half of which were  pack  animals.   As
   they passed loaded with everything but the kitchen sink (and maybe  even
   that - I did spot a large wood stove tied to one packhorse), I reflected
   on our very different styles of camping. But here I am probably  in  the
   minority. This is definitely horse country.


   I was back in camp by 3:00 (8 miles, 4550 ft and  8  hr  total).  I  had
   originally planned to move camp this day a little farther down the trail
   toward my next destination, Boiling Lake, but I soon  gave  up  on  that
   idea. It had taken longer to climb to Oval and back than I  had  planned
   (too much tedious and slow talus).  My  camp  was  so  pleasant,  I  was
   rather tired and the thought of moving camp just didn\'t  appeal.   So  I
   lounged around the rest of the afternoon, painting, washing  up  by  the
   lake and enjoying the larches on the opposite shore backlit by the  late
   afternoon sun.  Magic! This night was calm and cold.


   Day 3 - I had much to do this day if I was to complete all my summits in
   my allotted four days, so I broke camp and was ready to go by 7:20.  The
   trail was very faint in the meadow below the lake but I had  checked  it
   out the evening before so knew where to go. It essentially went straight
   downhill through the center of the meadow following Fish  Cr,  until  it
   entered some trees below and became easy to follow again.  I  picked  up
   the Summit Trail (#1259) in another meadow  farther  down  and  followed
   this trail through some lovely open terrain, then forest,  up  and  down
   over two passes to a junction with the 1  mile  spur  trail  to  Boiling
   Lake.  I  was  now  out  of  the  Chelan-Sawtooth  Wilderness  and  into
   motorcycle country and the trails showed it, being built for  wheels.  I
   hit Boiling Lake at 1:20 and set up camp for my third  night  on  the  E
   side near a small creek (11 miles, 2560 ft and 6 hr). I had seen no  one
   all day and again I had the lake all to myself.


   I left to climb my next 3 summits at 2:00 hopeful but doubting  I  would
   be back before dark. From the lake I followed a good horse trail S up  a
   draw to a 7440 ft saddle, dropped a bit  on  the  other  side  to  avoid
   cliffs, then climbed up again to the S  ridge  of  Cheops  (8270).  This
   ridge was then followed N on tedious talus, first to the  left  then  to
   the right of the crest. The summit ridge of Cheops is quite  ragged  and
   not sure which of the points  was  the  highest,  I  ended  up  climbing
   several pinnacles.  My conclusion was the S point was the highest  (1500
   ft and 1:30 hr).


   I retraced my route back to the Cheops-Martin saddle, then  continued  S
   along the ridge toward Martin.  Where the ridge steepened,  I  traversed
   on the right flank then worked my way up to the summit (2200 ft and 2:40
   hr). Martin turned out to be a decent scramble on fun rock. There was  a
   large cairn on top and a register placed in 1994 by  Mike  Torok.   This
   was the first register I had found on any of the summits. (I  placed  my
   own registers on some of the other summits until I ran out.)


   Next on the agenda was Cooney (8321), also called Switchback  by  Becky.
   It looked a long ways off, and as it was now getting late I was  worried
   that I didn\'t have enough daylight left to make that summit,  especially
   if I had much slowing talus to cross.  But of course I continued on.  As
   it turned out the traverse to Cooney was quite pleasant and easier  than
   anticipated, and I greatly  enjoyed  the  terrain  above  the  beautiful
   Cooney Lake basin. The summit of Cooney had a huge cairn, behind which I
   took refuge from a now biting wind, but no register (2700  ft  and  3:40
   hr).  Now all I had to do was get back to camp.


   Impatience lured me directly down the W side of Cooney in  search  of  a
   "shortcut" rather than pick up  the  Foggy  Dew  Tr  (#417)  to  the  S.
   Probably not the best idea as I ran into  cruddy  scree  and  unpleasant
   gullies.  But I did make it down and hit the Summit Trail in  the  broad
   saddle SE of Pt 7228 at 6:20 in fading light some 3 miles from camp.  It
   was then an easy matter to follow this freeway of a motorcycle  trail  N
   back to the Boiling Lake Tr and then my tent, the last bit  by  headlamp
   (6 miles, 3250 ft and 5:50 hrs).  I was so tired that I crawled into  my
   sleeping bag right away and made a simple dinner lying down.
   Day 4 - This was by far the coldest night.  Everything  froze  hard  and
   there was a heavy layer of frost on my tent, which didn\'t help an  early
   start for my last summit and the trip out. But I did manage to get going
   by 8:30. I found another horse  trail  (they  were  everywhere)  leading
   directly from the lake toward Hoodoo Pass. Below the pass  at  a  likely
   looking spot I dropped my overnight pack for the dash up Bigelow  Pk  on
   the SW slope, a simple climb (1680 ft and  1:50  hr  from  Boiling  Lk).
   Bigelow had another register left by Mike  Torok.  Before  descending  I
   wandered over to an interesting rocky point on the ridge to the S with a
   fun little scramble.


   I took a long lunch at Hoodoo Pass and scoped out Hoodoo  Pk  and  Raven
   Ridge for a future outing, before beginning the 6.5 mile descent  of  the
   mostly uninteresting East Fork Buttermilk Tr.  Shortly below the pass  I
   met a couple coming up, my first  people  since  the  horse  party.   We
   chatted. I told them I had to get back to the West  Fork  Buttermilk  TH
   where my car was.  They kindly offered to drive me around, but  as  they
   were still on their way up, the timing wasn\'t quite right.   However,  I
   told them that if I was still at their TH when they  came  out  I  would
   gladly take them up on their offer.  But of course I wasn\'t.


   I hit the TH at 2:45.  From here I walked up the road over a mile toward
   Buttermilk Butte until I hit the ridge, then plunged downhill  for  1200
   ft on the other side.  At first I was able to follow  a  well  used  cow
   trail and I thought my descent would be easy.  But soon  the  cow  trail
   ended at a muddy spring.  Then I was on my own as I wandered down  awful
   forest so littered with deadfall and booby traps progress  slowed  to  a
   crawl. No wonder forest fires are so bad around here.  This forest was a
   tinderbox waiting to explode with so much dry fuel  on  the  ground.  It
   also wasn\'t that obvious which way to go, what with various ravines  and
   subridges to cross.  But eventually, with the help of my GPS, I hit  the
   West Fork Tr very close to the TH and the car at 4:30 (12.5  miles,  2480
   ft and 8 hr from Boiling Lk).


   I did find the miles of talus hopping this time of year tedious but  the
   beautiful golden alpine larches more  than  made  up  for  that.   I  do
   believe this is the best area I have ever been to for fall larch  color.

Terrace Mtn (USGS Scenic, Mt Daniel) - Taking advantage of
unseasonably good weather for so late in the year, I drove the Tonga
Ridge road (18.3 miles from Foss River road) to its very end in an old
clearcut (3600 ft).  The road was in good condition the whole way.
There seemed to be no signs of any way trail anywhere, although I did
check out a few stray flags - but they seemed to only lead into
hideous brush. There being no hope for it, I gritted my teeth and
plunged into the brush at the end of the road, heading for the nearest
line of timber.  Matters were not helped by a thick feathery coating
of ice crystals on everything.  Once out of the clearcut, things
improved a bit, but not greatly, and I struggled on heading blindly
uphill in a generally SE direction. Somewhere in this mess I happened
upon a lone flag tied to a tree.  Were they as lost as I was?

Eventually I reached the crest of Terrace\'s N ridge, but
disappointingly, travel did not improve.  I was getting positively
discouraged that I would ever make my destination at this rate with so
few daylight hours. Still, I carried on, until to my absolute delight
I stumbled upon a way trail (at 4800 ft) a short ways higher right on
the crest. This was a puzzle to me where it came from or where it was
to go.  Someone had obviously done a lot of work clipping brush to
make the way passable.  Although very steep and rough it was
infinitely better than crashing the brush and my spirits immediately
improved.

Following this way trail, I began to make much better time, soon
emerging  into the open at a flat area of the ridge (5300 ft) covered
with sparse crusty snow. Here I got my first view of Terrace. At the
far end of the flat I passed a messy campsite, then veered right with
the ridge. The way trail continued up, then contoured the grassy
hillside. Eventually it seemed to lead downhill, so I gave up
following it and headed back to the crest of the ridge. Perhaps the
trail went to Lake Clarice.

I continued up and down along the ever more inviting ridge, going over
Pt 5789 where the terrain became rocky and alpine. At about 5800 ft I
reached the final rise of the mountain.  This began as a narrow rocky
ridge that I attacked head on, for the most part class 2 scrambling.
Then I traversed a bit left onto broader slopes.  There was not much
snow but what there was very hard and icy. If there had been more I
would have sorely needed crampons.  As it was I was able to avoid most
of it and continued steeply back up to the crest.  At the false summit
(there is always a false summit) a notch and an interesting slot gully
barred the way. A 10 foot class 3 step down, then the final summit
rock, which I turned by a traverse to the right , put me on the
pleasant summit at 3:10 (3200 ft and 3:30 hrs).

It was sunny and warm on the summit and the view of Daniel and Hinman
lovely, but daylight was running out and I had a long way to go to get
out.  So after leaving a register, I quickly began the way back. Being
very careful on the summit rocks, but practically running along the
gentler ridge sections I made it back to where the way trail left the
first flat open area before needing my headlamp.  I stuck with the way
trail to several hundred feet below where I had picked it up in the
morning (to 4300).  I was most hopeful that it would lead back to my
car and get me through all that brush.  But the lower I followed it,
the farther I got from my car.  It seemed to be descending to the east
side of the ridge, not the west side, where I needed to go.  Perhaps
eventually, it would have traversed back to the west, but I couldn\'t
take that chance.  I was afraid of  ending up in Deception Cr a long
ways from my car. So again I gritted my teeth and left the trail for a
most unpleasant traverse back toward my car.  The last bit in the
clearcut  was the worst, blindly following my GPS through head high,
newly frosted brush. Actually the inch long ice crystals were really
beautiful, but I don\'t think I fully appreciated them at the time.
Anyway, I managed to come out right at my car.  Thank heavens for
GPS\'s.  About 7 miles, 3500 ft and 7 hrs - Fay Pullen 12/3/02.

Bearjack Ridge, West Peak and East Peak (USGS Redtop Mtn.)  -  With  limited
time  available,  these  two  low  Back  Court  peaks  seemed  a  reasonable
objective.  I started from the Miller-Bear TH in  the  Teanaway.  The  first
obstacle was crossing Miller  Cr,  which  I  accomplished  by  wading.   The
second obstacle was crossing Bear Cr, this time on  a  half  submerged  log.
Once across these two creeks, which were running  high  with  snow  melt  on
this warm day, I headed south uphill through steep  open  woods  to  the  NE
ridge of the West Peak, then followed this ridge to  the  summit  (1400  ft,
1:30 hr). A tiny cairn marked the top, to which I added a tiny register.

Continuing east along the main summit ridge, I climbed over  several  bumps,
including points 4464 and 4542. For  the  most  part  this  ridge  was  very
pleasant travel through woods, grassy meadows and open lithosol.  Fields  of
Spring Beauty and Glacier Lilies and one lone  Bitterroot  graced  the  way.
Occasionally a bit of annoying brush  would  bar  passage.  After  almost  2
hours of rambling, I emerged on the summit of the East Peak. (2600 ft,  3:20
hr). No cairn here so I built a small one and added another tiny register.

From the East Peak. I plunged north and west  downhill,  first  on  a  ridge
then steep hillside to hit Bear Creek just  west  of  the  junction  of  the
north and south forks.  Luckily a convenient log at this point allowed  easy
crossing to the Ironbear trail on the other  side.   I  had  run  into  very
little snow up to now and so was somewhat surprised  to  find  much  of  the
trail still snow-covered in this protected valley. A half hour later  I  was
back at the TH, with wet feet as I was too lazy to remove my boots  for  the
final crossing of Miller Creek. 6 miles, 2600  ft,  5:15  hrs.  Fay  Pullen,

K9 (USGS Stevens Pass)  -  Beginning  in  drizzle  and  fog  that  persisted
throughout the day, I was able to follow the Tunnel Cr trail all the way  to
Hope Lake where solid snow took over.  From here  I  headed  uphill  to  the
south to the saddle SE of Point 5567. A descending traverse  brought  me  to
the basin E of K9. Climbing W out of the basin up steep slopes  to  K9\'s  SE
ridge led to the main summit ridge. Several inches of new wet snow  set  off
small sluffs in the steeper sections as I postholed calf deep in the  slush.
After a fun short mini knife-edge snow ridge, where I could put one foot  on
each side of the crest, I followed this ridge to the rocky summit.  A  cairn
and a pill container register marked the spot.  Inside the register was  the
smallest little tablet I have  ever  seen.   The  only  entry  was  by  Dick
"kangaroo" Kegel dated 9/26/03.

There was no sense hanging around for long as I couldn\'t see a thing  and  I
was beginning to get damp. The descent down the steep stuff was rapid.   Not
so the traverse back to the saddle. I lost my  tracks  in  the  woods  above
Hope Lake and so initially missed the Lake, but I was soon  back  on  route.

Reynolds Peak (8512 ft) & Rennie Peak (7742 ft), May 13-14, 2004


Starting up the Reynolds Cr trail off the Twisp River road, I ran  into  the
first snow at 4400 ft after about 2 miles. As the snow  depth  increased  so
did my frustration level as I alternately stayed on top and  postholed  knee
deep or deeper, never knowing which would occur when. At 5100 ft I  found  a
snow free spot in the woods to camp (4 miles, 2000 ft, 2:15 hr).

30 minutes later I was on my way to climb Rennie Pk.  The  frustrating  snow
continued to slow my progress.  I was able to stay on the trail  until  5600
ft. Open snow slopes and a short steep wooded rib led to the basin  east  of
the peak. Here conditions improved as the snow became firmer and  I  quickly
climbed to the final talus slopes leading to the summit (2650  ft,  2:30  hr
from camp).

There was a cairn but no register so I left one.  It  was  now  7:30  and  I
could see weather approaching from the Twisp River valley.  I knew  I  would
have to hurry to make it back to camp before dark to  be  able  to  find  my
tent in the featureless forest. Snow snifters soon changed  to  steady  snow
that began sticking on the rocks and ground.  I  did  make  it  down  before
dark, dragging into my tent at 8:55 where the snow had turned  to  rain.   I
made dinner and went to sleep in my toasty dry sleeping bag to the sound  of
several hours of light rain.

The next morning dawned clear and sunny. I started at 7:00 for  Reynolds.  I
began by traversing south through awful snowy woods where every  other  step
I sank in hip deep. This mostly level traverse of less than Â½ mile  took  40
minutes.  Not a great  start.  After  crossing  Reynolds  Cr  on  a  log,  I
traversed a slide path and began climbing steeply up the left  side  past  a
waterfall until the slope lessened with a series of lovely snow basins  that
led to the trough between the main and north peak of Reynolds. As lovely  as
this alpine area was, I couldn\'t appreciate  it  fully  as  the  frustrating
snow conditions still persisted. My pace slowed to  a  crawl,  I  seemed  to
lose energy and visions of a summit by 11:00 vanished.

As I slowly made progress upwards I examined the cliffs to  my  left  for  a
route onto Reynolds NE ridge.  I saw a  couple  of  possibilities  but  most
ended in overhanging cornices and I wasn\'t even sure the NE ridge  could  be
followed to the summit.  So I stayed in the trough  heading  for  the  route
from the E described in Becky which I knew culminated in a class 3-4  gully.
I could see the beginning of this gully in the distance  but  couldn\'t  tell
yet if it led easily to the summit.

I reached the base of the gully (8000 ft) at 10:40 and had my answer, or  so
I thought. Continuous snow led straight up seemingly  all  the  way  to  the
ridge.  Only 500 ft to go.  Piece of cake. Two hours later I  was  still  at
it. First, the snow in the gully suddenly turned icy, so I put on  crampons.
Second, the gully was deceptively steep, steeper than it had appeared to  me
from below.  Even with an ice axe in one hand and a  ski  pole  axe  in  the
other I felt decidedly insecure. I\'m not sure what the angle was  but  since
I kept bumping my knees that usually means 50 degrees or so. And third,  the
upper part of the gully steepened even more and ended  in  a  cornice.   The
bottom line was I was not a happy climber and by  the  time  I  figured  all
this out, several hundred feet up, it was too late to retreat gracefully.  I
was  getting  decidedly  freaked  out.  Considering  my   options,   neither
continuing up nor going back down the gully appealed.  I did have a rope  in
my pack but it did little good, as there was no way to get to it.  The  only
option that had any promise at all was to traverse to the right onto  broken
rock.  This I did and, after teetering on a ledge  to  remove  my  crampons,
was able to work my way out of  the  gully  and  onto  a  very  steep  upper
snowslope. The snow here was soft and unconsolidated  and  didn\'t  make  for
very secure stepkicking.  It was also punctuated here and  there  with  rock
and the resulting holes that often form next to such features.  I  ended  up
laboriously manufacturing holds by excavating the snow  from  the  rock  and
packing it down securely. After a hundred feet  or  so  of  this  I  reached
secure ground a few feet from the  summit  and  collapsed  with  a  sigh  of
relief (3500, 5:45 hrs.).

There was a large cairn on top and a  register  placed  by  the  Boealps  in
1985.  However, the  booklet  was  full  so  I  added  another  one  to  the
container. I spent a short Â½ hour on the summit, worrying how to  get  down.
No way was I going down the way I had come up.  I  briefly  toyed  with  the
idea of rappelling down the NW ridge.  It didn\'t look  that  long,  was  all
rock and I would probably be able to find anchors, but in the end I  decided
not to chance it. The SE face was melted out and  appeared  to  be  an  easy
scramble. If I could then traverse N beneath the summit pyramid  to  the  NE
ridge, there was a good chance I could find a way off  that  ridge  back  to
the snow trough of my ascent. I just didn\'t  know  if  I  could  follow  the
ridge far enough to be able to do that.  It looked pretty rocky. But it  all
worked out.  I was able to follow the ridge, with minor scrambling here  and
there and by staying high to bypass several deep gullies, although I had  to
go all the way to the saddle below Pt 7038 before I could  exit  the  ridge.
Soon I was on my uphill tracks and  back  at  camp  at  3:45  exhausted  and
soaked from sinking in knee deep on every step. After a  mandatory  hour  to
rest and rehydrate, I was on my way out, reaching the car at 6:30  happy  to
have survived my little adventure.

Grand total 17 miles, 8455 ft.

Horse Lake Mtn (4640 ft), Jack Ridge (7828 ft) & Axis Pk (7550 ft) - May 19-
20, 2004

I had business in East Wenatchee at 6:30 PM on May 19 - a public hearing  of
the Douglas County Regional Planning Commission (Douglas County is where  my
cabin is located).  Not wanting to "waste" a trip to the area, I decided  to
combine business with pleasure. But what to  do,  especially  with  such  an
awkwardly timed meeting?

My plan was to first climb Horse Lake Mtn.  This low  Back  Court  Peak  had
never seemed worth the effort of a drive all the way to  Wenatchee.  But  it
seemed perfect for a little trip to complete before my meeting. I  drove  up
Number Two Canyon Road to the gated road, and started on  my  mountain  bike
at 1:40 PM. The trip actually turned out to be a  little  gem.  The  terrain
was  surprisingly  interesting,  but  most  noteworthy  was  the  absolutely
gorgeous display of wildflowers  -  vast  fields  of  solid  gold  arrowleaf
balsamroot and purple lupine.  I  have  never  seen  better.  They  were  so
beautiful I  kept  getting  distracted  and  had  trouble  concentrating  on
keeping my bike on track, especially on the fast ride back down.  I  reached
the cute little summit at 3:00 amongst gathering  thunderclouds  then  raced
back to the car just beating the rain (1800 ft, 2:45 hr).

My meeting was over at 7:30, which gave me time to drive  to  the  Eightmile
Lake TH and start up the trail at 9:00 by headlamp.  The  rain  had  stopped
but all was wet and fresh. I set up camp at the first campsite  I  found  at
the lake at 11:00. (3.3 miles, 1400 ft, 2 hrs)  I had  eaten  dinner  before
leaving, but I did have a snack, although I fell asleep  while  waiting  for
my cup of herbal tea to brew.

I was on my way the next morning at 6:45 heading for Jack  Ridge.   I  don\'t
have much to add to Jim Brisbine\'s recent report of  the  same  peak,  as  I
essentially went the same way, and I was on top  at  11:10  (3165  ft,  4:25
hr). I spent a glorious hour on the summit basking in the sun and  sketching
Mt Stuart.  I also scoped out Axis Pk.  I had no information as  to  how  to
climb it, but from what I could see from Jack and by looking at  the  map  a
reasonable route appeared from the snow basin west of  the  peak.  The  hard
part would be finding the base of  this  route  once  in  the  Eightmile  Cr
valley and getting across the roaring creek.  Also,  I  wasn\'t  sure  I  had
enough energy left for another climb and  thunderclouds  were  forming  over
the Enchantments and heading my way.  I would see how I  felt  and  how  the
weather held once I was back in the valley.

Both the weather and my energy level held.  I found an easy log crossing  of
the creek  and  traversed  upward  without  too  much  difficulty  onto  the
pleasant snowslopes of the  drainage  west  of  the  peak.  Where  the  main
drainage kept straight ahead, I climbed steeply left into a  hanging  basin.
From here a continuous steepening snowslope led upward to  emerge  onto  the
west ridge just shy of Pt 7397. Melted out sandy shelves  and  boulders  led
past several annoying false summits on the ridge until  finally  culminating
in the highest point, which I reached at 4:10 (5785 ft 9:28 hrs).   I  added
a register to the small cairn that  overlooked  Eightmile  Lake.   The  lake
looked so close below me. Alas, I would have to retrace my roundabout  route
back to it.

Descending down the west drainage, near the bottom I began  traversing  east
toward the lake but ran into unexpected cliffy and rugged  terrain  and  had
to wander around a bit before hitting the  flat  of  the  valley.   Again  I
found an easy log crossing of the creek.   Downed  trees  are  plentiful  in
this valley. I was back in camp at  6:30.  The  sun  was  shining,  my  camp
pleasant and I had the whole lake to myself. I  would  have  loved  to  have
spent another night, but family obligations required my  presence  the  next
morning. So after a rest and snack, I gathered my weary bones  together  and
headed out at 7:50 PM arriving at the car at 9:15 with enough light  to  get
by without a headlamp. Total 18 miles & 7350 ft.

Two incidents occurred on the way home, both  on  highway  97  over  Blewett
Pass. First I almost hit a deer. I mean I came within 2 feet of hitting  it.
 Thank heavens for ABS. Then a short time later I had a blowout and  had  to
change the tire by the side of  the  road  in  the  dark.   I  had  to  take
everything out of the back of my  Cherokee  (remember,  besides  my  camping
gear I also had a mountain bike) to get at the tire and  boy  are  those  16
in. tires heavy.  I could barely lift it. At least it wasn\'t raining. I  was
very happy to finally make it home at 12:30 AM.

Mountaineer Peak (6935), May 27-28, 2004


The weather forecast was not good,  not  even  for  the  east  side,  but  I
figured I would still have better luck over there.  I  hoped  to  climb  the
high point of Mountaineer Ridge above Lake Stuart.  If things were  too  bad
to allow that at least I would have a nice hike to the  lake,  where  I  had
never been. I went expecting and prepared for rain.

In no hurry, as it was an easy 4.5 miles to  the  lake  on  good  trail,  and
perhaps hoping for improvement in the weather,  I  didn\'t  leave  town  till
2:00 pm and started on the trail to Lake Stuart at 5:20. It  rained  lightly
the whole way in, but I stayed mostly dry by using an  umbrella.  The  trail
was very pleasant hiking and snowfree until very  near  the  lake,  which  I
reached at 8:00 (4.5 miles, 1600  ft,  2:40  hrs).  I  found  a  lovely  bare
campsite right on the lake with a good view of  the  twin  gullies,  to  the
left and to the right of  the  summit,  leading  to  the  top  of  my  peak.
According to John Roper, the right one was easier.  I  fell  asleep  to  the
sound of wind waves lapping on the shore of the lake. The rain had ended.

On my way the next morning at 7:30, I followed  a  rough  trail  around  the
lake, then entered snowy woods and crossed the lake\'s inlet creek.  The  day
began with promise  -  partly  cloudy  skies  and  even  a  few  minutes  of
sunlight.  But that was  short  lived  as  the  clouds  gathered  themselves
together and by the time  I  reached  the  large  open  slopes  beneath  the
gullies it was snowing steadily and beginning to  accumulate.   Off  and  on
snow showers, with moderate clearing in between continued for  the  rest  of
the climb.

Despite the 1-2 inches of fresh topping, the underlying snow  was  hard  and
before entering the right gully I donned  crampons.  The  gully  appeared  a
straight shot up, but, as gullies usually do, steepened near  the  top,  and
after about 900 ft I opted for an exit right. Another  couple  hundred  feet
of steep snow brought me to the summit rocks. I  stashed  crampons  and  ice
axe, and scrambled up snow-covered rocks casting around for the  summit.   A
fearsome looked pinnacle loomed left and appeared the highest point.   Lucky
for me it was not, and, circumventing it, I continued left along  the  rocky
ridge to the cairned high point (1800 ft, 3 hrs). A film can  register  held
the familiar names of John Roper and Jim Brisbine.

Visibility was good enough to peer over the edge down  to  Lake  Stuart  and
across to Axis, where I had recently been.   But  the  top  portion  of  the
frightful north face  of  Stuart  was  buried  in  the  clouds.  I  gingerly
downclimbed the slippery rocks to my stash then began  the  tedious  process
of backing down my steps until the steepness of the snow relented. Slow  but
safe. I was back to my tent at 12:45 where I enjoyed a  2.5  hr  rest  before
heading out  at  3:20.  I  even  stopped  to  do  some  sketching  during  a
particularly inviting sunny period.  It had stopped precipitating,  but  the
clouds still came and went.  Once past the Colchuck Lake  turnoff,  I  began
meeting parties coming in getting a head start on the Memorial Day  weekend.
Some of them  looked  to  have  serious  plans  in  mind.   With  the  still
unsettled weather, I wished them luck. Back to  the  car  at  5:45,  a  most
leisurely and pleasant trip, despite the weather.  12 miles, 3400 feet.

Martin Peak (8511) and Bonanza Peak Attempt (9511)      June 2-4, 2004


Up to now I have avoided trying Bonanza Peak because of the hassles (not  to
mention expense) of catching the Lake Chelan ferry to Lucerne and  then  the
bus up to Holden. I hate being dependent on ferry and  bus  schedules.   But
after searching for any possible alternative, I  finally  decided  this  was
still the fastest and easiest way to approach the peak.

So Wednesday found Linda and me leaving town at 6:00am  to  catch  the  9:45
Lady II at Field\'s Point. Cost was $12 to park the car for  two  nights  and
$28 RT each to Lucerne.  A $3 surcharge had been  recently  added  to  cover
the high cost of fuel. The boat landed in Lucerne at 11:30 where  we  and  a
dozen paying guests piled onto the school bus for the 12 mile, 2000 ft  ride
up to Holden.  We arrived in Holden at 12:15 but were held  captive  in  the
bus for another  15  minutes  while  the  guests  went  through  an  initial
orientation to the rules and  regulations  of  the  village.  We  then  made
reservations for the bus trip  out  on  Saturday  ($10  RT  each)  and  were
finally on our way up the Hart Lake trail at 1:00.

A mile on old road and another Â½ mile on trail  brought  us  to  the  Holden
Lake junction and we slowly began the hot climb  up  to  the  lake  sweating
under packs heavy with climbing gear. The trail was well maintained with  an
easy grade and snow free until we entered the lake basin where we  lost  the
trail.  Emerging on the shore of the lake at 4:45 (5.5 miles, 2000  ft,  3:45
hrs) we were startled to see a bear feeding  in  the  meadow  a  short  ways
away. He seemed unconcerned  and  completely  ignored  us  as  we  did  him,
although it did increase our resolve to hang our food high.

We spent the  next  hour  searching  for  a  snowfree  campsite;  eventually
finding a lovely spot nestled at the boundary between boulders and trees  on
the north side of the lake. Our campsite had a stellar view of the route  up
Bonanza and what I saw made my heart sink.  The  whole  face  was  plastered
with fresh snow from the previous two weeks of storms.  I  had  a  very  bad
feeling about the whole thing. Then while eating dinner  we  saw  a  strange
shining light appear in the sky and slowly set over  the  NE  ridge  of  the
mountain. Neither Linda nor I had ever seen anything like it.  Was it a  UFO
or our guardian angel trying to tell us something?  In retrospect I am  sure
it was the later. A further warning came during the night in the form  of  a
large avalanche roaring somewhere down the face. But being  single  focused,
as climbers frequently are, we awoke the next morning still planning  to  at
least go up and check things out.

We began at 8:00 on Thursday climbing toward Holden Pass. A late  start  you
may say for such a major peak, but we felt no  hurry  with  such  long  days
this time of year.  Good thing we were late. Below  Holden  Pass  we  turned
left to climb steeply through a cliff  band  unto  the  upper  snow  slopes.
Passing another smaller band with slabs beginning to melt out we worked  our
way toward the glacier. The day was  warm  and  sunny,  the  snow  soft  and
slushy.  It was beginning to be an effort breaking trail. At 11:00 and  7500
ft we stopped to rest and rope up to cross the glacier. All of a  sudden  an
avalanche let loose from the upper slopes of  Bonanza  and  swept  down  the
snow finger and onto the glacier, right over the route we would  have  taken
up. If we had left an hour earlier we would have been  right  in  its  path.
Linda and I looked at each other. No words were even necessary.  We  may  be
slow learners but we  weren\'t  completely  stupid.  Then  to  emphasize  the
situation, two more good sized slides let loose in  the  next  few  minutes.
But we needed no more  convincing.  Before  heading  down,  I  measured  the
amount of new snow over the old crust.  It was over 2 feet deep.

My original plan had been to climb Bonanza today (Thursday) and  Martin  the
next day (Friday) and hike out on Saturday. Probably the smart thing  to  do
would be to stick to that schedule, descend  to  camp  and  rest  and  start
fresh for Martin  tomorrow.  But  we  both  hated  to  have  to  regain  the
elevation again to Holden Pass and we still had a lot of daylight left.   So
we decided to head directly to Martin. We had a good view of  the  route  on
the west ridge.  It didn\'t look easy  but  it  was  mostly  snowfree  so  we
wouldn\'t have any avalanche dangers.

From Holden Pass, We followed the west ridge on easy snow  to  the  6640  ft
saddle below Pt 7205. Traversing below cliffs,  we  then  followed  an  easy
ramp trending left and back onto the broad  crest  of  the  ridge.  Here  we
stashed our unneeded glacier gear and crampons, but took the  rope  and  ice
axes. Following the crest to the next small  saddle,  we  traversed  on  the
south side, then followed a gully to a notch (#1). Ledges on the north  side
appeared possible but ended in a snowslope capped by a rocky step.  Back  to
the notch, where we left our ice axes, to try the more possible rock on  the
south side. We worked our way gradually up over increasingly difficult  rock
to another  airy  exposed  notch  (#2).  We  were  now  stuck.   Other  than
retreating, the only possible  way  was  along  the  narrow  rock  crest,  a
cheval. Roping up, I scooted along the crest some 50 ft  or  so  to  another
notch (#3) and easier terrain, then brought Linda over. A  gully  led  to  a
4th notch and a deadend.

It was now about 4:00, unbelievably my  altimeter  indicated  we  still  had
1000 ft of elevation to go and the terrain was getting harder,  not  easier.
Were we destined to fail a second time today?  Our only hope was to  descend
and hope for easier going. Back to notch #3 and down the  gully  to  a  snow
slope which we were forced to cross.  Fortunately, I had kept a second  very
short ice axe with me and the  snow  was  so  soft  it  was  not  a  problem
crossing it. On the other side, sandy ledges and scree led easily up and  we
finally began to make faster upward progress. After about  500  ft  we  were
back on the crest at a 5th notch. Here was an  old  tattered  rappel  sling,
the first sign of other climbers we had come across.  Linda had  had  enough
and decided to wait for me here while I made a last effort for the summit.

I headed up the last 500 feet at 4:30, taking  the  rope  and  promising  to
turn around at 6:00 at the latest. I climbed solid rock to the  left  of  an
unpleasant looking gully, then  traversed  into  the  gully  higher  up  and
continued to work my way up a series of ledges and gullies, always near  the
crest. An exposed but easy section along the  very  top  of  the  ridge  was
followed by a vertical 15 ft chimney and ledge to the final scramble  and  I
was on the summit at 5:20. My altimeter read 150  feet  low.   We  had  been
closer than we thought and this last bit  was  easier  than  anticipated.  A
quick photo, a sign-in of the old metal register (to which  I  added  a  new
notebook), a bite to eat and I was on my way back down at 5:30 and to  Linda
at 6:15.

I had rappelled the last unpleasant gully above the  notch,  and  since  the
rope was already out, we made  another  rappel  down  the  gully  below  the
notch. We downclimbed to notch #3, then rather than reversing the  a  cheval
ridge, crossed to the north side and descended ledges  to  the  cliff  above
the snowfield we had seen from notch #2. A rappel, where we  had  difficulty
finding an anchor, dropped us to the snow and the easy ledges  back  to  our
ice axes at notch #2. From there we were able to downclimb  to  our  glacier
gear stash.  All this took time and  it  was  now  8:30  with  one  hour  of
daylight left.

From the stash we traversed SE until directly above Holden Lake  and  zoomed
down easy snowslopes and a gully to emerge at the bear meadow  and  actually
made it to camp before dark at 9:30 (6 miles, 5000 ft and  13:30  hrs  total
for the day). By the time we collected ourselves, had dinner and  fell  into
bed it was 11:00.

Up the next day, Friday, at 7:00, left at 10:00 and back to Holden at  12:40
in time to make arrangements to take the bus out, one  day  early,  at  1:45
and catch the 2:30 (which actually  came  at  3:00)  boat  back  to  Field\'s
Point. We even had time to buy a hearty lunch at  Holden  and  cool  off  on
this very warm afternoon in the pleasant waters of Lake Chelan  waiting  for
the boat.

Grand total: 17 miles and 7000 ft.

 Grotto Mtn (USGS Baring) - I was able to coax my Cherokee all  the  way  to
 the end of FR 6028 (2200 ft), although the last  bit  was  very  rough  and
 overgrown to a narrow passage. It was an easy start up the open clearcut at
 the end of the road to the woods about 500 ft  above,  then  along  a  spur
 ridge to 3400 ft where an unpleasant steep traverse left with  intermittent
 snow led into a snow gully at 3800 ft.

 The soft snow made for rapid step kicking up the gully until  coming  to  a
 large basin at 4600 ft  Here I was met with a  major  obstacle.   A  hidden
 "crevasse" crossed the entire slope. I have never seen anything quite  like
 this before at such a low elevation on non  glacial  snow.  It  was  not  a
 bergshrund or moat where the melting snow  pulls  away  from  rock  slabs. 
 Looking down into various holes it was solid snow as far  as  I  could  see
 (maybe 15 feet). Could this perhaps have something to do with  the  massive
 slab avalanche described by Stefan Feller (P&P  Mar 2002). Maybe  this  was
 the crown wall of the avalanche that had then been partially filled in with
 subsequent snowfalls and  avalanche  debris.  At  any  rate,  I  had  great
 problems getting across this thing, and lost about an hour in doing so.
 Once above the crevasse I veered right up steepening slopes to hit the SW
 spur ridge at 5500 ft. Another steep traverse up led to the main NW ridge.
 A vertical 15 ft snow pitch, which I belayed, and a tiptoe along the
 remaining corniced ridge and I was on the summit, with a stunning view of
 Mt Baring. A tiny register was in the bare summit rocks.

 I basked in the sun and the views for a while before heading down to tackle
 crossing, very carefully, the crevasse once  again.  Scary  business.  Once
 across, the rest of the descent was a piece of cake. 

3600 ft and  8  hours.

 North Gardner and Gardner Mtns (USGS Silver Star  Mtn,  Mazama,  Gilbert  &
 Midnight Mtn) - After taking 7 hours to hike 12 miles and 3100 ft  gain  up
 the Wolf Cr trail, the last half of which  was  snow  covered,  I  found  a
 pleasant spot in Gardner Meadows (5800 ft) on bare  ground  under  a  tree,
 with a small meltwater creek close by, to pitch my tent. Light snow showers
 fell during dinner.

 The next morning I was off by 7:30, heading mostly  north  up  easy  frozen
 snow toward the saddle between  Gardner  and  Pt  8487. It  was  positively
 frigid and an icy wind made me regret not bringing a face mask. There  were
 intermittent light snow showers and sun breaks. At an upper basin  at  7000
 ft I veered left up a likely looking slope to gain the south  ridge  of  Pt
 8487 to avoid the nasty looking cornices near  the  saddle.  A  short  rock
 scramble, then easy snow and scree brought me to the  summit  of  Pt  8487.
 Then down to the saddle with North Gardner.  A pinnacle  was  in  the  way,
 which I bypassed by unpleasant loose scree then icy snow on  the  left.   I
 put on crampons for this snow traverse.

 Once at the main saddle, it was  a  pleasant  scramble  on  snow  and  rock
 working my way up to the summit of North Gardner (8956)at 11:45. Buried  in
 the snow I found the register that had been placed by Don Goodman in  1986.
 Surprisingly, after the icy wind and snow showers on much of the ascent, it
 was warm and sunny on the summit, and I took a moment to enjoy the views.
 I retraced my steps back to Pt 8487  then  descended  to  the  saddle  with
 Gardner (8200 ft). The climbing guide  implied  that  the  ridge  could  be
 followed from the saddle to the summit of Gardner, but  it  is  very  rocky
 with numerous small pinnacles and under the present icy conditions  I  gave
 up on that idea after a brief attempt.  If I wanted  to  climb  Gardner,  I
 would have to descend 800 ft and traverse around to the south side.
 An easy scree slope led down  from  the  saddle,  then  a  long  descending
 traverse on snow left around the basin under cliffs until the  south  slope
 could be accessed.  This slope then proved to be an easy climb up onto  the
 broad summit area.  I reached the summit of Gardner (8898) with  its  large
 cairn at 4:00. My descent back to camp was pretty much  directly  down  the
 south slope, which only took a little more than an hour. Again  dinner  was
 accompanied by light snow which fell much of the night.
 I awoke to warmer temperatures than yesterday, but about 2 inches of  fresh
 snow. I had a leisurely breakfast and left about 10:00. About 4 miles down,
 in the forest, I followed the fresh tracks of a good sized bear in the  new
 snow for a mile or so.  That kept me more alert than usual for the rest  of
 the trip out. I reached the car at 3:30. 

30 miles and 9550 ft. Fay  Pullen,
 Kent, 5/5-7.

 Sheep Mtn (USGS Bedal) - The road to Monte Cristo still had extensive  snow
 patches as I walked the long mile to the Sauk River bridge. Here I left the
 road and wandered NE across confusing bottomland. I crossed two streams  in
 this area flowing in opposite directions from each other.  Very strange.
 Once across the flat, travel improved as I made my way up  reasonably  open
 timbered slopes. At about 3200 ft I began to traverse left under cliffs and
 then entered a major snow gully at 3400 ft.  At the point  I  entered  this
 gully on a sort of level bench there was evidence of  a  massive  avalanche
 occurring earlier this winter. The avalanche  had  come  tearing  down  the
 gully, hit the level bench and continued 100 feet  or  so  up  and  over  a
 wooded spur above taking out every tree in sight. Trees large and small lay
 in a contorted and tangled mess of impenetrable shattered wood. I made good
 time up the gully although cracks were beginning to appear in the snow  and
 I could hear the creek roaring in the depths below.  These required caution
 to cross. At about 5000 ft the gully began to narrow and steepen and headed
 in a wall above, so I exited right up an easy snow slope  over  a  rib  and
 into the next gully.  Here  I  ran  into  old  kicked  steps  and  glissade
 tracks.  Someone had been this way recently.

 Bypassing a small waterfall on dirty rock on the left, I then made good use
 of the old steps up the steepening gully on continuous snow all the way  to
 a gap in the S summit ridge at 5860 ft. A short rock step out of the gap, a
 meander along the mostly snowy ridge and a simple  scramble  up  the  final
 rock tower, about 1/4 mile from the gap, led to  the  pleasant  summit.   I
 lamented the fact that I had no views on this misty and foggy day,  but  at
 least it wasn\'t raining. 

7 miles, 4100 ft & 8 3/4 hours.  Fay Pullen, Kent,

Turquoise Pk. and Malachite Pk. (USGS Big Snow Mtn.) - The West Fork Foss
River trail was largely snow free to just before Malachite Lake.  The lake
itself was still mostly frozen over and surrounded by snow but I did find a
lovely campsite on a snow free bench slightly above the logjamed outlet (4
miles, 2500 ft and 3:15 hrs to here).  After lounging around for two hours
on this warm sunny day, I started for Turquoise Pk. at 5:00 PM. Thinking I
had plenty of time to climb this peak, I soon found I had underestimated
its difficulties and ended up barely making it back to camp before dark.
Thank heavens for the long days this time of year.

A traverse north from the lake\'s outlet on steep brushy hillside soon
brought me to an open snow basin below Malachite Pk. Easy snow led to the
saddle between Turquoise and Malachite, then  slightly steeper snow to the
false summit. So far so good.  But then I got my first good look at
Turquoise. More challenging than I had anticipated. A short descent would
gain the saddle below the final impressive summit pyramid where a long
traverse beneath an impassible rock wall would then be required before the
upper snow slopes could be accessed. These upper snow slopes were very
steep with the runout over the rock wall, so even though the soft snow made
for good step kicking, I elected to exit as soon as possible to the NW
ridge and slither through tree branches and up heathery rock the last 100
ft to the summit (2200 ft and 2:30 hr).

On top I found a film can register left a few years ago by John Roper and
Mitch Blanton. To this I added a new small register of my own. The descent
off the summit pyramid was tense and slow backing down my steps. The rest
was straight forward, but it was 9:30 PM before I dragged back to camp with
barely enough light to find my way.

I started the next morning at 7:30 AM for Malachite retracing my route to
the snow basin. From here I headed up the right side of the slope leading
directly toward the peak, mostly easy snow except for some scrub trees in
the middle. Near the top I diagonalled left to a notch at 5800 ft on the
south ridge. From here I traversed left directly beneath the rock wall,
partially on snow and partially on scree, to another notch on the west
ridge. Now on the north side of the summit, I was confronted by very steep
snow that first required a small descent to bypass a rock spur then a
traverse left and up.  Again I disliked the runout of this snow slope so
exited left as soon as possible to gain the east ridge. Here I followed the
narrow crest of the ridge and an easy but very exposed ledge on the south
side and through a notch that put me above the disagreeable snow slope. A
few more steps and I was on the summit. (2250 ft and 3:00 hrs). Here I
found a register left by Steve Fox the previous September.

I spent a very pleasant hour in the sun on the summit taking in the view of
all the peaks in the heart of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness before beginning
the nerve-wracking descent, again very carefully backing down the snow.
Then came several fun glissades and I was back in camp at 1:30. I left at
3:00 for the uneventful but hot trip out reaching the car at 5:30.  These
two days broke records for high temperatures in June. 14 miles and 7400 ft.

Black Pyramid and Three Musketeer Ridge  (GT  The  Enchantments)  -  For  my
annual pre-permit trip to the Enchantments Linda and I headed  up  the  Snow
Lake trail to Nada Lake. Shortly after crossing Nada Cr  we  picked  up  the
climber trail on the left side of the talus slope.  Near  the  head  of  the
talus a ledge gave access to the slabs left of  thundering  Nada  Waterfall,
and a steep cairned scramble route led into Temple Canyon where we ran  into
the first snow. We found a delightful campsite on a  snowfree  slabby  bench
right next to the creek at 6300 ft with a panoramic view  of  Black  Pyramid
and lower Temple Ridge (6.5 miles, 5000 ft and 7:20 hrs).

After a leisurely breakfast the next morning, we started for  Black  Pyramid
at 9:30, which gave time for the morning sun to soften the snow  (we  didn\'t
bring crampons). The peak looked very formidable from camp but Becky  listed
the East Ridge as class 3 and 4. However, the description of this route  was
very sketchy so I knew the climb would be an adventure.

From Camp we crossed a flat soggy  snow  basin  then  climbed  up  a  narrow
couloir to the broad shelf below the North Face.  By now the snow  was  soft
enough for good step kicking. We followed the shelf east to  its  end  where
we worked our way up unpleasant wet slabs to gain the  East  Ridge  at  6950
ft. We looked straight down on Snow Lakes, which  appeared  very  high  with
water  flowing  over  the  dam.   Here  roped  climbing  began  as  we  were
confronted with a steep step that we passed by going around a corner on  the
right and up a series of ledges back  to  the  crest.  A  tiptoe  along  the
narrow exposed crest brought us to the base of the  final  uplift,  where  a
scramble gully led left to a notch.

Crawling through a hole under a large boulder put us on a wide  sandy  ledge
on the  south  side  of  the  ridge.  Broken  rock  appeared  to  promise  a
reasonable route up from here.  But  what  appeared  reasonable  from  below
turned out to be quite challenging. Expecting moderate  class  3-4  rock  we
had not brought rock shoes and were climbing in heavy boots.  The  rock  was
quite downsloping and slippery with black lichen (from which the  peak  gets
its  name),  the  holds  were  sparse   and   protection   cracks   minimal.
Nevertheless, I managed to work my way up about 60  feet  to  a  ledge  with
several trees, then left to an alcove below a  vertical  wall.  Things  were
really looking bleak now and I was getting near my limit. But the  wall  had
a nice crack running all the way up that would  take  protection  nicely.  I
also found evidence of others passing this way, such as rappel slings and  a
dropped #10 hex.  I was on some route, but class 4 it was not. So  I  fought
my way up the crack, pulling on pro as needed, to a squeeze chimney  at  the
top that did major damage to my epidermis. Here I found I was on the  summit
ridge and could look straight down  the  North  Face.   But  where  was  the
summit?  I climbed to the top of the high point next to my notch  and  could
see pinnacles to both the east and west.  Which  was  highest  I  haven\'t  a
clue, but getting to either would be hazardous to my health  so  I  declared
my pinnacle the summit.  Good enough for me. My altimeter read 7425 ft.

Linda had gamely followed me to the tree ledge in order to belay me  higher,
but she too had had enough and elected not to go  higher.   So  much  for  a
reasonable class 4 route. Several rappels and much downclimbing got  us  off
the rock, careful plungstepping down the couloir and we  were  back  in  our
most welcome camp at 6:30 (1125 ft and 8:30 hr RT)

During the night marine air came in as a weak disturbance  approached.  Even
so we had intermittent sun for breakfast. Then we were on our  way  at  9:00
for Three Musketeer Ridge on the other side  of  Temple  Canyon  from  Black
Pyramid. This time we traveled light with no climbing gear except the  rope.
We gained the south ridge just above Musky Lake, which was then followed  up
easy scramble terrain bypassing cliffs and boulders on  the  left.   We  hit
the ridge just left of the twin highpoints  (east  of  the  three  pinnacles
that give the ridge its name) where we had  a  spectacular  view  of  Edward
Mesa, Toketie Lake and Leavenworth. Easy scrambling  up  big  boulders  with
fascinating clefts and cracks accessed both summits.  I concluded  the  east
one was higher, where I left a register. We lingered admiring  the  view  in
the other direction toward Temple Ridge and the Lost  World  Plateau.   From
this vantage point Black Pyramid looked like an insignificant,  though  very
jagged, bump on lower Temple  Ridge,  greatly  overshadowed  by  the  higher
Comet-Professor group and Mt Temple itself. I could pick out the pinnacle  I
had climbed in the center but I was still unable  to  determined  where  the
summit was, though most likely it was to the west.

We could see weather approaching from the direction of  Cashmere  Mtn.  Time
to go.  We descended directly to charming Musky Lake on very pleasant  sandy
slopes, but were caught halfway down by a rain shower.  This  continued  all
the way back to camp when it abruptly ended and welcome sun appeared to  dry
us out. (1400 ft 3.5 hrs RT).

A quick rest for lunch and we were on our way out at  2:00.   Another  short
rain shower caught us descending some of  the  worst  slabs  alongside  Nada
Waterfall. We made two rappels to aid  the  descent  with  the  heavy  packs
before reaching the trail at 4:00 and the TH at 7:00, more  than  ready  for
the fitting reward of a gourmet dinner in Leavenworth. 16 miles and 7700  ft
gain.  Fay Pullen, 6/11-13/03.

Sherpani Peak (6720+ ft) and Nursery Peak (6962 ft) - June 11-12, 2004


It was sprinkling, never enough to get really wet, and the sun  even  shined
now and then as I started up the Paddy Go Easy Pass trail at 12:40  pm.  The
trail was snowfree until rounding the corner into the basin about  500  feet
below the pass, where snow soon took over. The pass  itself  was  completely
snow covered, but I was lucky enough to find a  bare  level  campsite  in  a
patch of trees slightly downhill on the north side (3 miles, 2800  ft,  2:40
hr). However, I had to descend another 250 feet to find running water.

After setting up camp, I started for Sherpani Peak  at  4:20  in  increasing
fog. The hard part was getting past the cliffs of Paddy Go North. I  climbed
onto the northeast shoulder, then descended some 500 feet down a steep  snow
gully until I could traverse  below  the  main  ridge  and  cross  the  east
shoulder of Pt 6564. A contour brought  me  to  the  saddle  just  south  of
Sherpani.  The south ridge was quite rocky,  so  I  traversed  to  the  east
ridge where easy snow led to the summit  rocks.  Though  short  these  rocks
looked rather intimidating in the damp fog, but a  crack,  and  then  ledges
spiraled counterclockwise to the final 6 foot summit block.   A  long  reach
(for me) from a small foothold pulled me on top the block (1275 ft and  2:10
hr from camp).

The summit register was a large notebook in an impressive metal case  placed
in 1992 and filled with tributes to Gene  Prater.  I  recognized  the  usual
assortment of names  including  Steve  Fox,  Mike  Torok,  John  Roper,  Don
Beavon, Mitch Blanton and Fred Beavon (exactly I year ago). I carefully  let
myself down off the block, circled back on the ledges,  but  in  going  down
the crack, I used an arm jam for a hold and promptly got my elbow stuck.   I
mean it was really stuck. As I struggled  for  several  painful  minutes  to
unjam it, I had a mental  image  of  the  next  summiters  coming  across  a
skeleton dangling by its  elbow  from  the  crack.  Not  a  pretty  picture!
Making little progress by struggling, I forced myself to relax and was  then
able to get free. I made it back to camp at 7:50 (1760 ft, 3:30  hr  RT),  a
little the worse for wear with a sore elbow. A very cold wind was blowing.

I awoke the next morning at 6:15 to the expected fog, but by the time I  was
ready to start for Nursery Peak at 7:30 the sun was shinning and views  were
appearing. I began the disheartening  1200  ft  descent  to  the  French  Cr
valley floor on snow, then down a rock step, then forest. I  hit  the  creek
in an open marshy meadow and  squished  my  way  upstream  looking  for  the
valley trail but only finding it very near the  saddle  to  Meadow  Cr,  too
late to do me much  good.  From  the  saddle  I  went  uphill  through  easy
meadows, heather and scree to hit Nursery\'s west ridge at the low point.  It
was then an easy matter to follow the ridge on the south side to the  summit
at 10:15 (2100 ft and 2:45 hr).

It was now sunny and warm and windless and I spent a glorious  hour  on  top
taking in the views I  had  missed  yesterday.  The  Cradle  was  especially
noticeable just to the north. The film can register had been placed in  1985
(it  identified  the  peak  as  "The  Bib")  and   only   had   5   entries.
Interestingly, 4 of them were from 2000 on, one each year to 2003.  Names  I
recognized were Greg Koenig and Mitch Blanton (from Bootjack and  Highchair,
10/15/00), Mike Torok (6/23/01) and Grant Myers (9/14/02).

On the way back I found the valley trail and followed  it  downhill  to  the
crossing of French Cr. It was higher up on the north side  above  the  creek
than I expected - probably to avoid the wet marshes. It looked  little  used
and went through several lovely meadows  carpeted  with  fields  of  glacier
lilies, spring beauties and shooting stars. From the creek crossing I  tried
to follow the trail leading to Paddy Go Easy Pass, but I  soon  lost  it  in
snow. Eventually I ran into my downhill tracks and  followed  them  back  to
camp (3300 ft and 6 hrs RT).

The brief period of good weather was coming  to  an  end  and  the  sky  was
clouding up. Rain had been predicted for later in the day.  So after  a  two
hour rest I packed up and zipped down the  trail  in  1:15  hr  beating  any
rain. I\'m not so sure about the couple I met at the trailhead just  starting
up though. I suspect they saw plenty of rain.  But they looked well  dressed
and equipped.  Oddly, the fellow lamented the fact that I had camped at  the
pass, stating he thought it was his secret spot. My reaction (unspoken)  was
is anyplace that has a good trail secret? Perhaps  he  meant  this  time  of
year when all is covered by snow.

Bonanza Peak (9511 feet) - June 28-30, 2004


The second time\'s the charm. After failing on Bonanza a  month  ago  due  to
fresh snow and avalanches, I was hot to give it another try,  but  I  wanted
to make sure the peak was in condition before going to all that  effort.  So
the previous week I climbed Copper with the secondary objective  of  getting
a good view of Bonanza.  What I saw looked good. The face  was  mostly  snow
free.  All  I  had  to  do  was  convince  Linda  to  come  with  me  again.
Surprisingly, she was all for it. So for the third time in a month  I  found
myself taking the  boat  and  bus  to  Holden.  It  was  all  becoming  very
familiar.

We started up the trail  to  Holden  Lake  at  1:40,  arriving  at  the  now
snowfree but buggy lake 3 hours and 2000 feet later. It was warm  and  sunny
but at least not sweltering like last week. Continuing around  the  lake  we
picked up the climbers trail, which was marshy and brushy at first, lost  it
briefly in talus and picked it up again on the other side,  reaching  Holden
Pass at 6:40 (7 miles, 3200 ft and 5 hrs). There were snow  patches  at  the
pass but we found a lovely bare spot to pitch our tent. We  fell  asleep  to
the thunder of the spectacular waterfalls spilling  over  the  cliffs  below
the Mary Green Glacier just across the valley.

On our way the next morning by 7:00, we began along  the  ridge,  passing  a
first small cliff through a slot to the left, up heather and talus and  snow
to the infamous waterfall slabs, which looked  quite  frightening.  We  were
able to cross a first waterfall by hugging the cliff on a ledge. Then up  on
slabs between watercourses to a second crossing, onto snow,  where,  if  you
lost it or the snow gave way, you would take  a  long  and  unpleasant  ride
down a waterslide over the lower falls. Next was easy snow along  the  right
edge of the glacier. At 8:30 and about 7900 feet we roped up and  began  the
traverse across the glacier toward the snowfinger leading to the SE face  of
the peak. We stayed high near the cliffs of the NE ridge  where  there  were
few if any crevasses.

Near the avalanche cone at the base of the  snowfinger  (we  speculated  how
much of that debris had come down during our first  attempt)  we  picked  up
the tracks of a previous party. We had learned in Holden  that  two  parties
were on the mountain the previous Saturday (this was Tuesday).  The  earlier
party was driven off by lightening and didn\'t make  the  summit.  The  later
party came after the storm and was successful. Timing is everything.

Linda led up the snowfinger following the previous tracks.  For some  reason
they hugged the right edge near glacial ice even  though  there  was  easier
terrain to the left. Linda, who excels on snow, made it up fine  but  called
down suggesting I put on my crampons. Good idea as  parts  were  quite  icy.
Snow was softer above this  section  but  there  was  still  occasional  ice
underneath. We continued to the  very  right-hand  top  of  the  snowfinger,
directly below the hanging snowpatch, crossed a suspect  snowbridge  to  the
end of the snow and cast around for a way  across  the  moat  and  onto  the
rock. We had to descend a short ways to find a reasonable spot. It  was  now
10:30 and 8650 feet.

We stashed our glacier gear, taking only one short ice axe,  racked  up  and
scoped  out  the  route  above.  It  looked  rather  intimidating.   Several
snowpatches were in the main gully and I could see one higher  up  near  the
ridge crest, where melting snow made the rock wet. It would be best to  stay
out of the gullies.  We  began  by  scrambling  a  couple  of  hundred  feet
simultaneously up easy rock, first right of the gully, then crossing on  wet
ledges to left of the gully. Soon the angle increased to the point where  we
began belaying. The climbing was never very difficult, mostly in  that  gray
area between scrambling and climbing. Several leads I didn\'t bother  to  put
in any pro, but at an occasional step or move it  felt  good  to  have  some
something in and belaying gave Linda the confidence to move faster  (She  is
more comfortable on snow than rock.  I am just the opposite, so  we  make  a
good team.)

We worked our way up the rock on a rib  to  the  left  of  the  gully,  then
traversed left to a wet gully below the upper  snowpatch.  There  was  great
latitude for variation, but the main route was fairly obvious following  the
line of least resistance and the many rappel stations. Some of the rock  was
very pleasant. Other was loose and careful climbing was  required  to  avoid
sending rocks down. I would not want to have  a  party  climbing  above  me.
Hardhats are recommended, which we did wear. We belayed perhaps  5  pitches.
I rather lost count. The last pitch I was forced onto the  upper  snowpatch.
Good thing I had my little ice axe along. From the snowpatch a  chimney  led
to the summit ridge and a rappel station on the north side.  From  here  the
needle like sheer ridge looked  impassible,  but  magically  a  hidden  slot
behind a horn led back to the south side and an  easy  but  loose  and  airy
scramble the final hundred feet to the summit at  2:30  (3100  ft  and  7.5
hrs).

The summit register  was  an  official  brass  Mountaineer  cylinder  placed
inside a metal clasped box. It dated from  1993  and  was  over  half  full,
having started on the back of the  pages.   We  were  the  second  party  to
summit this year, after the one successful party of the  previous  Saturday.
We spent a glorious hour on top basking in the reflection of a  panorama  of
snowy peaks before beginning the unpleasant but necessary  task  of  getting
off this thing.

Six or so rappels, again I lost count, got us down to the  scramble  section
below the main gully and then our equipment stash. We both put  on  crampons
for the trip down the snow finger. Linda led off and was out of  sight  with
me still close to  the  rock  when  the  rope  stopped  moving  for  several
minutes. As I climbed up to within sight of her she  informed  me  that  she
had fallen through the suspect snowbridge. She  saved  herself  by  throwing
herself horizontally across the gap and was glad she  had  crampons  on  for
purchase against the icy wall of the hole. Needless to say I found  a  lower
way onto the snowfinger proper. We stayed more to the right on the way  down
the finger and avoided most of the icy section of the way up.  It  was  then
clear sailing down the glacier, until we hit the waterfall slabs. They  were
even more frightening than on the way up as more water  was  cascading  over
the rocks than in the morning and facing downhill didn\'t  help  the  psyche.
The step off the snow onto the gushing wet  rock  was  unnerving.   We  both
survived, although we both also got wet feet. We were back in camp  at  8:00
for a 13-hour roundtrip.

We made the trip back to Holden the next morning in 3.75  hours  arriving  at
12:00 just as a thundershower hit. What timing! We were so happy  today  was
not our summit day.  It rained moderately heavy for over an  hour.  We  were
in time for the first sitting of lunch at 12:00 (the second is at 1:15)  and
the hearty meal of soup and salad and homemade bread fortified  us  for  the
long trip home.

Cathedral Peak (8601 feet), Amphitheater Mountain (8358 feet) and Remmel
Mountain (8685 feet) - July 7-9, 2004

With showery weather forecast for several days over  the  Cascade  Crest,  I
decided to try  my  luck  farther  east  in  the  Pasayten  Wilderness.   My
preconceived wishful notion of this area was  that  it  is  normally  sunny,
warm, dry and bugless. It ended up being none of these.  My first  clue  was
arriving at the Thirtymile TH at the  end  of  the  Chewuck  River  road  to
clouds, light sprinkles and cold temperatures. I had packed  very  light  in
keeping with the long distances I would have to travel, but made a few  last
minute additions in keeping with the unexpected conditions  before  starting
up the trail a little before noon.

Unknown to me beforehand, the Chewuck Valley was the site  of  the  Farewell
Fire of 2003 and the results were immediately evident. In fact I  was  lucky
to even get to the trailhead.  The last couple of  miles  of  the  road  had
numerous washouts that had only recently  been  cleared.  The  trail  itself
wandered for the first  9  miles  or  so  through  charred  forest  and  the
extensive flood damage that inevitably occurs once  ground  cover  is  lost.
The flood damage was not limited to creek beds. In places it  appeared  that
whole hillsides had slid covering the trail for hundreds of feet in  debris.
A lot of work had been done recently to make the trail passable  and,  if  I
had to guess by the evidence of limited traffic so far,  was  probably  only
opened on the July 4th weekend. Many other trails in  the  area  were  still
closed, including Andrews Cr, Fire Cr and Coleman Ridge.

The weather was unsettled all day (in  fact  the  whole  trip),  alternating
between sun and sprinkles. It never rained hard enough to require rain  gear
but the threat was always there. At least it was cool hiking and there  were
no bugs. At 9 miles and 4:00 I turned onto the Tungsten Cr  trail.  At  15.2
miles and 7:15 I hit the Boundary trail and turned left  toward  Apex  Pass.
Soon after, I met a hiker (one of 3) with an East  Coast  accent  who  asked
how far it was to the Tungsten Cr trail. He seemed very  afraid  they  would
miss the junction (many of the trails are poorly marked  in  this  area).  I
told him he was very close and since it was right by old mine  buildings  he
couldn\'t miss it. He went on  to  tell  me  how  they  were  snowed  on  the
previous night at Remmel Lake, incredulity evident in his voice.  It  didn\'t
surprise me given how cold it was.

At 8:00 I crossed Apex Pass, a lovely meadowy area that would  have  made  a
nice camp, but I really  wanted  to  get  as  close  to  Cathedral  Pass  as
possible before stopping. Here I got my first look at Cathedral Pk, the  top
of which was in the fog. At 8:50 PM I found a  perfect  site  just  off  the
trail in the headwaters of Cathedral Cr and set up my camp in  waning  light
(19.5 miles, 4300 ft and 9 hrs). During the night I heard  precipitation  on
my bivy tent that sounded suspiciously like snow but it didn\'t last long.  I
briefly worried about my prospects the next morning, but mostly I slept  the
sleep of the weary.

I was able to get through breakfast and packing  the  next  morning  without
precipitation, but as soon as I began at 7:00 AM hiking  the  last  mile  to
Cathedral Pass it started to snow. At the pass it was  snowing  and  blowing
and foggy.  Things were not looking good. I  blindly  headed  uphill  a  few
hundred feet, stashed my overnight gear in the rocks and  continued  with  a
very light day pack - very light because I was wearing all my clothing.   It
had stopped snowing but was still very cold. Most of the snow had melted  or
was blown by the wind into protected areas.

I couldn\'t see the notch I was  supposed  to  be  heading  for  but  figured
following just left of the S ridge would get me to the vicinity. Soon I  was
high enough to see the notch, where I  picked  up  a  climbers  trail.  This
followed right along the base of cliffs and up rock,  where  occasionally  I
had to remove my gloves for handholds, to a fascinating vertical sided  slot
filled with snow. A large cairn was here. I descended into the  icy  slot  a
few feet where I could see a long step up would lead  to  a  ledge  and  the
ridge above. I dinked around here for a long time figuring out  how  protect
this move.  I am acutely aware that even  a  short  slip  can  have  serious
consequences for me climbing alone. I didn\'t have my usual  full  compliment
of gear, bringing only a 40-foot rope, an assortment of 7  small  to  medium
chocks, 4 carabiners and some slings. With a cam I  could  have  had  bomber
pro in a second.

Eventually, I rigged some pro to my satisfaction and  gained  the  ledge.  I
scrambled up to the ridge,  followed  along  the  crest  a  short  ways  and
descended slightly into a notch (actually the other end of  the  snow  slot)
where the move out of the notch over a  deep  cleft  again  gave  me  pause.
Some rime on the rock didn\'t help matters.  Once I figured  out  this  final
move it was an easy scramble the remaining few feet to the  summit  (3  hrs,
1570 ft from my camp).

Something wonderful happened while I was stuck in the slot - the fog  lifted
and the sun came out. I was ecstatic. Not only did I make my  summit  but  I
actually had views. I could see back to Apex Mtn, my  camp  of  last  night,
the unusual long ridge of Amphitheater, down  to  Cathedral  Pass  and  Lake
and, farther away, impressive Remmel Mtn. What gorgeous country.

 There was no register in the summit cairn that I could find so I  left  one
of mine, then started down arriving  at  my  overnight  pack  at  11:30  and
Cathedral Lake at noon. Here I took an hour rest for lunch lounging  in  the
most welcome sun. As I was preparing to leave, a couple on horseback  passed
by coming from Remmel Lake.  The man  exclaimed  the  beauty  of  this  high
country but complained of the monotony of the  long  trail  up  the  Chewuch
River.  He should try it on foot.

From the lake I continued on trail around the west arm of  Amphitheater  and
into the SW basin.  I was preparing to stash my overnight pack at  7500  ft,
when another horse party passed by headed for the saddle  between  the  west
and middle peaks to look down on Cathedral Lake. A good horse trail  led  to
the saddle.  I followed this a short ways then headed right up easy  terrain
to the summit of the higher middle peak. I found no register but  could  not
leave one of mine as I had only brought one on this trip. I was back  to  my
pack at 2:40 (1 hr RT from pack, 800 ft).

I was now hoping to add Remmel Mtn to  the  itinerary,  today  if  possible.
But how to get there from here? Remmel is easily climbed  by  the  trail  on
the SE side, but I was  on  the  NE  side  with  impressive  ridges  barring
access. Of course I could always follow trail down Remmel Cr  then  back  up
around the mountain to Four Point Lake, but  this  entailed  an  extra  6.5
miles and 1400 ft gain. I thought I could see a XC route that would  get  me
over the E ridge.  With this plan in  mind  I  continued  on  trail  through
gorgeous open country  headed  for  the  cutoff  trail  to  Remmel  Cr  that
bypasses Remmel Lake. Somehow I missed it and ended  up  at  the  lake,  not
where I wanted to be. The whole area  is  crisscrossed  by  a  confusion  of
unmarked horse trails. This lost me some time, then even more time as I  was
forced into a detour way around the impassible bog at the head of the  lake.
I then went downstream leaving the trail at 6600 ft and 4:15.

I next wandered through confusing forest littered with downed logs,  plagued
by bugs newly activated by moisture and the warming day with no view  as  to
where I was going. I got very discouraged and thought maybe  I  should  have
stuck with the trail. Climbing Remmel today was fast becoming not  possible.
But I stuck with it and eventually found myself  in  the  basin  NE  of  the
summit at a rocky tarn, just where I wanted to be.

The sun was gone, again, and it began to hail just in time to  accompany  me
up slippery talus to the 7640 ft notch at the head of the  basin.  I  wasn\'t
sure what the descent on the other side  would  be  like.   It  looked  very
steep on the map. As it turned  out  it  was  very  easy,  easier  than  the
ascent, on grass and dirt and I quickly descended to the  7088  ft  tarn  on
the south side.  I found a delightful campsite near  the  outlet  stream  at
7:00. (12.5 miles, 4000 ft and 12 hrs  for  the  day)  Fortunately,  it  had
stopped precipitating, which made setting up camp more pleasant. It was  too
late to try Remmel today, so I had a leisurely dinner and turned in early.

During the night it rained moderately hard for a long time and  I  think  it
also thundered but I was too tired to worry about it and slept soundly.  The
rain stopped by morning, thank heavens. Bivy tents are a pain  in  inclement
weather. Just dressing  inside  one  requires  all  manner  of  contortions.
Forget about eating or cooking in one.

I started for Remmel at 6:00 AM. I briefly considered  going  east  from  my
tarn directly to the summit.  It looked like it would go but it also  looked
quite steep and rocky near the top. Considering my time constraints and  the
wetness of the weather I decided not  to  chance  it.  Instead  I  contoured
south then east on wet talus into the basin SE of the summit where I  picked
up the old lookout trail, which is in very good shape, that led all the  way
to the summit, now in dense fog (1.5 miles, 1.5 hr and 1625 ft).  On  top  I
found a touching register placed in 1998 by Mike Torok in  memory  of  Chris
Weber. I was the first one to sign in for 2004, right  below  the  last  one
for 2003 by Don Beavon on 9/30, his 97th highest 100.  As  we  all  know  he
completed the last 3 a short time later. Another interesting entry was by  a
woman admitting she messed up royally.   She  was  trying  for  the  Coleman
Ridge trail and ended up here. Admittedly the unmarked trails in  this  area
are confusing, but you\'d think she would have begun to get suspicious  after
climbing up  over  a  thousand  feet  too  high.  She  stated  her  dog  was
particularly unhappy!

No views for me on this summit, but I was just happy to  be  on  it.  I  was
back down to camp by 9:00.  After a snack and  short  nap  I  was  ready  to
start the long hike out at  10:40.  I  went  downhill  from  my  tarn,  past
another tarn, and hit the trail below at 11:00. I met  another  horse  party
at the Four Point Lake junction going to the lake. 2.5 miles of rocky  trail
brought me to the Chewuch River at 12:15 and  no  bridge.  Oh  there  was  a
spindly log upstream a ways but it was not appealing. Besides  a  ford  felt
good to my complaining feet. On the other  side  I  picked  up  the  Chewuch
River trail. 4 miles of up and down and frequently boggy trail and I  closed
my lollipop loop at the Tungsten Cr trail. 9  more  miles  of  now  familiar
trail and I was back at the TH at 6:10, not a bit too  soon  as  far  as  my
feet were concerned. (16 miles, 375 ft, 7.5 hrs from tarn camp). I  had  met
no one on the trail since the horse party at Four Point Lake.

Grand Total: (51 miles and 10,300 ft)

Tieton Pk, Curtis Gilbert (USGS Pinegrass Ridge, Jennie\'s Butte, Walupt  Lk)
- Linda and I started up the South Fork Tieton River trail  at  11:00.   The
trailhead at Conrad Meadows was filled with horse  trailers  and  the  trail
had been turned to deep dust by the many horse hooves.  People on  foot  are
definitely in the minority here.  After about 2 miles  we  turned  off  onto
the unmaintained Tieton Pk trail.  This trail was easily followed  at  first
as it wandered some  3  miles  farther  along  beautiful  Conrad  Cr  before
seemingly coming to a deadend at an exceedingly marshy meadow.  We  squished
our way across, at places in danger of sinking calf deep  in  muck.  On  the
other side we picked up the trail again.

The trail now became harder to  follow  even  though  there  were  signs  of
recent work and horse travel.  I doubt  this  work  was  sanctioned  by  the
forest service as it mostly consisted of new blazes  or  dabs  of  turquoise
paint on trees. Very odd. The trail, which had thus far only climbed 600  ft
total, now decided to make up for lost elevation and  began  to  climb  very
steeply.  Eventually we lost the trail completely as the  blazes  and  paint
both ran out and we entered an area of many crisscrossing  elk  trails.   We
even saw a few of the critters that made these trails. We continued  up  and
left into opening meadowy terrain following whatever game trails led in  the
generally right direction around the E ridge of Tieton Pk. We stopped  in  a
delightful meadow  at 6300 ft directly below the SE slope  of  our  peak  (8
miles, 2400 ft and 4:45 hr).

After setting up camp we started up Tieton at 4:45.   Scree  and  then  snow
led to a notch on the S ridge where we were greeted with a magnificent  view
of Mt Rainier and Old Snowy.  We continued N along the  rotten  ridge  until
forced to the W side to bypass a pinnacle. To gain the ridge again  entailed
some of the loosest rock it has been my displeasure  to  ever  climb.  Every
step felt like you would set the whole hillside  in  motion.  At  one  point
crossing a gully we did set off a scree avalanche that just kept  going  for
several minutes while we hung on for dear life.  Very spooky.   We  made  it
off the loose stuff to safety for the last little bit along  the  ridge  and
an easy chimney on the right  to the summit (1400 ft and  1:30  hr).   There
was no summit register so I left one.   I  really  doubt  that  many  people
climb this pile of junk. By the way, Becky  has you climbing this peak  from
the saddle above Cold Lake and following the long (and loose)  SW ridge  all
the way to the summit.  Crazy!

On the way down we thankfully found  a  slightly  better  lower  route  that
bypassed the worst of the moveable gully. The  standing  glissade  down  the
snow from the notch almost made up for the unpleasant ridge.  We  were  back
in camp by 7:30.  We ate dinner watching a large herd (40?) of goats on  the
hillside across Conrad Cr.

I had already climbed Curtis Gilbert  via  the  usual  route  up  the  Meade
Glacier, but Linda had never been up it, so I agreed to climb it again  with
her.  To this end we started the next morning at 8:00, first  traversing  to
Cold Lake, then up the Conrad glacier to the  notch  leading  to  the  Meade
Glacier.  The snow was soft, the step-kicking easy. From the notch  a  steep
traverse on snow led to the summit ridge where we  picked  up  the  climbers
trail to the summit.  I had remembered the rock on Curtis Gilbert  as  being
very loose, but compared to Tieton it was positively  solid  and  a  joy  to
climb.  This relieved Linda greatly, as after  Tieton  she  had  anticipated
the worst. We were on the summit  by  11:00.   There  was  a  nice  register
container but it was filled with scraps of paper.  I had neglected to  bring
a waterproof notebook so we added our own scrap. Whatever  happened  to  all
those nice registers that used to adorn summits.  Is someone  systematically
removing them?

We were back in camp by 1:00 where we attempted to relax and rest.  But  the
sun was so hot in this shadeless campsite that we gave it  up  and  left  at
2:30.  We decided to return via the South Fork Tieton trail and make  a  big
loop back to the car.  This entailed traversing S over gorgeous open  alpine
meadows with dozens of creeks and waterfalls.  For the  most  part  we  were
able to follow a way trail, but there was still much snow this high  and  it
came and went. We anticipated an easy time of it so were not  prepared  when
we were completely stopped by a raging fork of Conrad Cr after about a  mile
(the main creek we were able to cross on a snow bridge).  We  could  see  no
other solution except to wade across. We chose a braided section  where  the
creek divided in two channels with a rest  on  the  island  in  the  middle.
Even so, by the time we were across our feet were numb from the icy water.

There were no more major difficulties in connecting to the  main  trail  and
following it 7.5 long, dusty miles back to the car at 7:30.   27  miles  and
6200 ft gain. Fay Pullen, 7/10-11/2003

Big Craggy (8470 feet), West Craggy  (8366  feet)  and  Sherman  Peak  (8204
feet)

June 15-17, 2004

I once again had business with Douglas County, this time  in  Waterville  at
the County Courthouse before the County Commissioners. I decided to  combine
this trip with a climb of the Craggy Peaks since I was over half way  there.
My meeting was at 10:30 am and I was done by 11:00. I drove on to  Winthrop,
up the West Chewach River road and Eightmile Cr road to  the  Copper  Glance
TH.

I started up the old mine road at 2:30 on a warm sunny afternoon. Once  past
the mine, the road turned to trail, rounded  a  corner  through  very  green
meadows alive with yellow glacier lilies and blue forget-me-nots and gave  a
stunning view of Sherman Peak.  This  peak  was  not  on  my  agenda  but  I
couldn\'t help being intrigued by it and immediately started plotting how  to
add it to my agenda. It was a beautiful peak from this aspect with its  rock
walls and snowy couloirs. After crossing Copper Glance Cr I  stayed  on  the
trail to Copper Glance Lake until coming to a little pond. I  thought  if  I
camped here I would be in position to climb all three peaks.  But  the  pond
was uninviting as a campsite and had no views, very important to me. I  then
considered camping at the lake half a mile on, but it seemed  too  far  from
the Craggys. So I headed upslope along the  creek  and  found  a  delightful
site on a knoll at 6700 feet just below the  scree  slopes  leading  to  Big
Craggy where I had a view of all 3 peaks (3.5 miles, 2900 ft, 3:15 hrs)

Two weeks ago I had been surprised by how much snow was on Bonanza.  Here  I
was surprised by how little snow there was.  I  had  hoped  there  would  be
enough to cover at least some of the scree, but there was essentially  none,
so as I started the next morning at the leisurely time of 8:30 I was  doomed
to work my way up the loose,  unpleasant  stuff.   Not  difficult  but  very
tedious. I headed straight up from camp, then right  toward  the  SE  ridge.
Near the top things got a little more interesting  as  the  slope  steepened
and became rockier.  I topped out on the summit at 10:30 (1770 ft,  2  hrs).
The summit register was a metal cylinder capped with a rubber  cork.  Inside
were wet pages wrapped in a plastic bag. The pages  were  filled  the  usual
suspects - Mike Torok (\'94), Mitch Blanton (\'96), Grant  Myers  (\'97),  Paul
Cho (\'02). Greg Koenig and Stefan  Feller  (\'02)  and  Mike  Collins  (\'02).
Since there was no room to sign any more and the cylinder wasn\'t big  enough
to add one of my waterproof notebooks, I replaced the register with  one  of
mine, including the loose pages after I dried them out a bit.

Continuing on to West Craggy, I descended most unpleasant scree  (it  wasn\'t
even "screeable" - too big and  lumpy)  to  the  low  point  of  the  saddle
between the two peaks, then worked my way left and up over more  interesting
scramble terrain, to a minor notch. Through the notch,  up  a  gully  and  a
very steep but short snowpatch, the only place an ice axe  was  required  on
either peak, to the main summit ridge. An easy walk led  to  the  summit  of
West Craggy at 1:15 (2740 ft, 4:45 hrs). Surprisingly,  West  Craggy  had  a
better register than the higher Big  Craggy,  an  official  Mountaineer  one
placed by Mike  Torok  on  9/3/94.   The  signers  were  the  same  cast  of
characters as on Big Craggy except that Don and Natala Goodman\'s names  were
added via a scrap of paper dated 8/9/92 (probably from a previous  film  can
register) and they noted they had  already  climbed  Big  Craggy  and  North
Craggy in 1983.

I descended from West Craggy to the minor notch,  then  went  down  a  loose
gully directly to the upper basin of Copper Glance Cr.  There  was  actually
some useful snow here that facilitated the descent and I passed  two  lovely
tarns not shown on the map.  The upper one was still frozen over, the  lower
one would make for nice camping. From the lower tarn I contoured back to  my
camp at 3:30 (2975 ft, 7 hrs).

It was early and I still had Sherman Peak  on  my  mind.   I  thought  about
moving camp to Copper Glance Lake for an early start up  the  peak  tomorrow
morning, but the prospect of packing up was unappealing and my camp  was  so
pleasant I just stayed put and spent a leisurely afternoon  resting,  eating
and reading a good book. What a life!

I was up the next morning and on my way at 7:15 reaching Copper Glance  Lake
at 8:00. Here I stashed my overnight gear and started  up  Sherman  Peak  at
8:20. I had very little information about how to  climb  this  peak,  but  I
could tell from the map and by what I could see it would not be  trivial.  I
had no climbing gear (particularly useful would be crampons) with me,  other
than an ice axe. So I was prepared to back off if things got too dicey.  But
it was such an appealing peak, and I was here, I had to give it a try.

The line of least resistance seemed to be the  snow  slope  above  the  lake
leading to a 7800 ft notch S of Pt 8109. But the slope narrowed to  a  steep
snow finger several hundred feet below the notch.  It would  all  depend  on
how soft the snow was.  Once at the notch,  the  other  side  of  the  ridge
appeared gentler, but I had to traverse  past  Pt  8138  and  another  rocky
tower before being able to access the N ridge of Sherman.  It  all  depended
on how easy this traverse was. Only one way to find out.

The snow slope started out easy enough and the  snow  was  soft  enough  for
good step kicking, but gradually it got steeper and as I  entered  the  snow
finger in the narrow gully the snow got harder. But  vigorous  step  kicking
still worked. At one point the snow  narrowed  to  3-4  feet  wide  and  was
undercut with a black hole. Conveniently, a ledge presented  itself  on  the
rock wall to the right and I was able to bypass this obstacle  and  continue
up rock and snow and by moat crawling  to  the  notch  above.  Crossing  the
notch I was pleased to find easily traversed talus  and  scree  slopes  that
allowed me past Pt 8138. The next tower  was  another  matter.  My  traverse
abruptly ended at the rock walls of the tower above and a chasm of a  ravine
below. A ledge presented a possible way but I couldn\'t tell if it  continued
all the way to Sherman\'s N ridge. I didn\'t want to chance it and get  stuck.
 So I opted for the sure plan of descending  along  the  ravine  600  ft  to
gentler terrain where I could cross and head back up again.

The rest of the climb was up easy talus and snow  to  the  summit,  which  I
reached at noon (2775 ft, 3:40  from  lake).  Another  official  Mountaineer
register greeted me on top, but this one only had 3  entries.  It  had  been
placed by a Mountaineer party on 6/18/00, but evidently  not  on  the  right
summit.  The next entry, by Steve and Liz Fellstrom, noted  they  found  the
register two points to the south toward Burgett Pk and carried it up to  the
true summit. I would say that the one  basic  requirement  of  those  kindly
willing to carry registers to mountaintops is that they place  them  on  the
proper summit!  The only other entry was the  ubiquitous  John  Roper.  From
the comments in the  register,  I  gather  that  all  these  people  climbed
Sherman from the south along the gentle ridge from Burgett Pk.  I  liked  my
way better.

Starting back at 12:30, I  was  back  to  the  notch  at  1:30,  and,  after
carefully backing down the snow finger, then a wonderful  sitting  glissade,
my overnight pack at 2:15 (3530 ft, 6:05). On  the  way  out  I  stopped  to
explore the mine, but was only able to go  in  a  few  hundred  feet  before
being stopped by a cave-in. It was possible to continue  past  this,  but  I
didn\'t feel it worth the risk.

Grand total: 14.5 miles and 9565 ft.

Jack Mountain (9066 feet) - July 13-15, 2004


Jack Mtn has been on my wish list for several years, but I kept  putting  it
off, either not finding anyone who  wanted  to  go  with  me  or  being  too
intimidated to try it alone. I didn\'t know if I  was  capable  of  doing  it
solo or if it was even wise (then again is  any  climbing  really  "wise"?),
but somehow the time seemed right  to  give  it  a  go.   The  clincher  was
rereading Mike Torok\'s trip  report  from  August  of  last  year  where  he
described the Jerry Glacier as free of crevasses and so crossed it  unroped.
 I had always worried about crossing the glacier by myself. And so  I  found
myself  starting  from  the  Canyon  Creek  TH  at  10:30  AM   with   great
expectations and not a little trepidation.

I was immediately confronted by a sign stating that  the  Canyon  Cr  bridge
was out.  An alternate start was suggested from the East  Bank  TH,  some  3
miles west, not very appealing.  Since  the  crossing  is  near  the  TH,  I
elected to check it out before going for the alternative.   It  didn\'t  look
so bad.  Of course, creek crossings are always deeper than they  look.   The
water ended up being crotch deep and by the time  I  got  across  my  shorts
were soaked and my bare feet and legs numb from the cold water. But  it  was
a warm day and once I started hiking the wet  clothing  actually  felt  good
and quickly dried.

Shortly after crossing, I was passed by  three  fellows  going  to  McMillan
Park. Thinking some explanation was necessary for my wet shorts I told  them
I got wet fording Canyon Cr. They seemed surprised, stating  that  they  had
looked at the creek and decided not to  cross,  instead  starting  from  the
East Bank TH.  Then they saw my ice axe and appeared a bit worried. "Do  you
think you will need an ice axe?"  they  asked.  "Yes,  most  definitely",  I
replied, as I explained I was climbing Jack Mtn. "Do you think we will  need
one?" they inquired further. "No", I answered. They seemed relieved,  but  I
really don\'t think they had a clue as to where I was going  in  relationship
to where they were going.

Once my  clothing  dried,  I  was  further  kept  cool  toiling  up  the  60
switchbacks on the steep trail by a thundershower that  brought  light  rain
off and on for an hour before the sun came back out.  As  I  was  hiking  it
came to me that I had forgotten to  put  a  fuel  canister  in  my  pack.  I
couldn\'t believe I had done that!  There would be no  hot  meals  or  drinks
for me on this trip. I reached the junction  to  Crater  Lake  at  2:15  and
Crater Lake itself at 3:00. Crater  Lake  is  located  in  a  lovely  cliffy
cirque with several spectacular waterfalls cascading down hundreds of  feet.
Another 1.5 hour up the Crater Mtn trail and I left the trail at 7100 ft.

A short steep descent on snow preceded a mostly level traverse to  the  7200
ft saddle between W and E Crater Mtns, and my first view  of  Jack  Mtn.  It
looked absolutely wicked, a long committing ways away, and I  had  my  first
"Moments of Doubt". The Jerry Glacier, however, looked benign and  I  easily
descended it to the 6600 ft saddle above the 5900 ft Jerry Lakes. A  further
descent and I found a wonderful campsite by the S lake at 6:15 (8.5  miles,
5200 ft, 7:45 hrs).  These lakes are worth the trip in themselves.

The campsite had a fire ring that looked well used. Hmmm! An  idea  came  to
me. I looked on the back of my wilderness  permit.  The  only  reference  to
campfires was if you had one to use dead down wood.  I  had  always  thought
campfires were prohibited in alpine areas.  Evidently not  in  the  Pasayten
Wilderness. Maybe I could have a hot dinner  after  all.  Now  it  has  been
years, if not decades, since I started a fire using only a match. I  had  to
go back to my Girl Scout training as a kid in New Mexico.   I  was  able  to
get a fire started and boil 2 pots of water for a  hearty  dinner  and  tea,
but my conclusion was campfires are highly overrated and more  trouble  than
they are worth except in an emergency. They are smoky,  time  consuming  and
take constant attention to keep  them  burning.  The  only  wood  available,
though plentiful,  was  dead  downed  branches  from  alpine  larches  that,
although they seemed dry enough, burned with a heavy sooty acrid  smoke.  My
blackened pot will never be the same and it will take heavy washing  to  get
the smell out of my clothing.

No hot breakfast or tea for me the next morning.  I made do with  an  energy
bar and some fresh fruit and was on my way at 6:00 AM.  I picked up the  way
trail out of the lake basin and over the 6550 ft saddle in the ridge  above,
then descended to the 5800 ft basin of Crater Cr and  up  easy  heather  and
snow to Jack\'s SE ridge at 7100 ft. A climber\'s trail starting on scree  led
to a long crampon traverse on snow under cliffs until  I  could  turn  right
and follow the snow to near it\'s high point and exit right onto a  ramp.  It
was now 9:30 and 7600 ft. The ramp led to a  higher  snowpatch  toped  by  a
short cliff that gave me trouble.  I tried several false leads getting  more
and more discouraged and having my second "Moments of Doubt". I was  finally
able to bypass  the  cliff  by  descending  right  along  the  base  of  the
snowpatch to cross below a  waterfall  then  back  up  on  its  right  side,
crossing left again above the waterfall and the cliff. This for me  was  the
key. Another short wall was just above, but this one had good  holds  and  I
had no trouble surmounting it. At the top was a rappel sling, the  only  one
I found on the whole mountain.

I didn\'t know it at the time, but this  waterfall  and  stream  drained  the
gully that leads directly to the notch just west of the summit, the notch  I
was supposed to be heading for.   But  this  gully,  partially  filled  with
snow, looked decidedly unpleasant to me and I stayed out of  it.  Above  the
rappel sling, the terrain eased off and climbing became  easier.   Mostly  I
stayed on the rib between the waterfall gully and the next shallow gully  to
the left.  Occasionally, I climbed in the shallow gully  itself.  Somehow  I
ended up too high, mistakenly heading for one of the spires on the W  ridge.
and was forced to make a dicey exposed traverse right  to  the  west  notch,
the most nerve-wracking part of the climb for me. From  the  notch  I  found
the climb along the ridge to the summit to  be  pleasant  and  enjoyable  on
decent rock. I reached the top at 12:15 (3900 ft, 6:15) greatly  elated  and
with that glow  that  comes  from  achieving  a  challenging  goal  with  an
uncertain outcome.

The summit register was a substantial plastic one with  a  small  loose-leaf
notebook inside placed on 8/5/95. Maybe 4-5 pages  were  filled,  one  side.
For such a major peak it doesn\'t seem Jack is climbed all that  often.   Don
and Fred Beavon signed in on 8/16/96, having climbed the N ridge  from  Ross
Lake. Mike Torok and party\'s climb of 8/2/03 was recorded.  The  last  entry
was 8/22/03. I was the first to sign in for 2004, which surprised  me  as  I
saw recent tracks at Jerry Lakes.

After properly enjoying the surrounding panorama of snowy peaks,  especially
recognizing the Snowfield Massive behind Ruby, I began my descent  a  little
after 1:00. Back at the notch, I was loath to repeat my dicey traverse so  I
headed straight down the gully.  It was  not  to  my  liking  either.   This
gully, though of low angle, was most unpleasant  with  loose  slippery  rock
and ball bearing gravel all perched above steep snow. As soon as possible  I
traversed out of the gully back to my ascent route on the rib to the  right.
Once there the descent went smoothly to  the  rappel  sling.  Since  it  was
there, I used it with the skinny 60-foot rope I had along, but I could  have
downclimbed just as well. Care was taken on the snow traverse (I didn\'t  use
crampons this time) to the SE ridge, then quickly  down  to  the  Crater  Cr
basin. A tiring plod 700 feet up to the ridge overlooking Jerry Lakes,  down
the other side and I was back to my tent at  6:00  (6  miles,  4700  ft,  12
hrs).

Although I had the time, I was too tired to face making another fire,  so  I
munched on odds and ends of cold food that included nuts,  crackers,  cheese
sticks and turkey jerky.  And I drank cup after cup  of  delicious  mountain
water. It was a very warm day. When I turned in before 9:00 it was still  67
degrees despite a short thundershower that produced a little rain  and  some
thunder.

I woke the next morning after 6:00 when sun hit the  tent,  and  left  after
leisurely packing up at 8:30. I was back to the Crater Mtn  trail  at  10:30
(2 miles, 1400  ft.  2  hrs).   Throughout  this  trip  the  other  dominant
feature, besides Jack, had been the main W peak of  Crater  Mtn  (8128  ft).
It is really a very impressive rocky crag that just  called  to  me,  so  of
course I had to climb it. I knew an old trail at one time led to  a  lookout
on the summit, but I had read the trail had fallen into disrepair.  A  steep
scramble section once had cables and ladders to facilitate  the  ascent  but
they were now gone. So  not  knowing  what  to  expect,  after  stashing  my
overnight pack, I took a daypack with my little rope  and  slings,  just  in
case. They were not needed.

I found the trail up Crater Mtn a delight, highly recommended.  Built  trail
ended at the base  of  the  cliffy  section  but  fading  yellow  paint  and
strategically placed cairns pointed the way.  It  was  fascinating  how  the
route zigged and zagged back and forth on ledges seeking out  weaknesses  in
the terrain. Looking from a  distance  you  wouldn\'t  think  the  route  was
climbable unroped but the rock and holds were good,  the  best  climbing  of
the trip. At the top of the cliff, built trail reappeared leading the  final
easy Â¼ mile to the top where I had lunch consisting of  a  dwindling  supply
of food. Of course the view  of  Jack  was  stunning.   I  was  back  to  my
overnight pack at 12:30 (2 miles, 1:45 hr, 900 ft RT).

At the McMillan Park Junction I soaked my  tired  feet  in  a  creek  before
heading down.  I met several backpacking parties sweating up the  steep  hot
trail. For the Canyon Cr  ford  I  left  on  boots  and  socks.  Crossing  a
slippery rock strewn  creek  bottom  is  much  easier  with  boots  on  than
barefooted. Despite higher water flow this hot afternoon, I  had  an  easier
time of it than on the way in.  I squished my way the  last  little  bit  to
the TH in soggy boots arriving at 4:15 (10.5 miles, 2300  ft,  7:45  hr  for
the day). Very hungry, I stopped in Sedro Woolly on the way home for a  much
needed delicious pasta dinner.

Bismarck Peak (7585 feet) Traverse - July 20, 2004


I decided to take a "rest" this week from several months of weekly  multiday
trips. So for fun Linda and I decided to climb Bismarck Peak, which  neither
of us had been up, and then see if we could traverse the ridge north to  the
Mt Aix trail.  We had both seen  this  ridge  from  Mt  Aix  and  it  looked
inviting and since the two TH\'s are  only  a  few  hundred  feet  apart  the
logistics were simple.

We started up the Pear Butte  trail  at  8:00.   It  was  cloudy,  cool  and
sprinkling lightly. The high ridges were in the fog. Neither of us  expected
this. We had come from a heat wave on the West side and were expecting  very
hot temperatures. It is rarely cooler in  Eastern  Washington  than  Western
during the summer. Enjoying the cool weather (and,  I  might  add,  a  light
pack), we made  pleasant  progress  up  the  trail,  turning  off  onto  the
Bismarck Pk trail at 10:45 (4.6 miles, 2800 ft).  My  maps,  both  USGS  and
Greentrails, showed this trail generally following the ridge  up  and  down,
but traversing right (south) of Pt 6816, all the way to summit.  Forget  all
that.

First, the trail we followed, traversed left (north) of  Pt  6816  and  then
just ended in a lovely meadow at 6300 ft. Thinking we may  have  gotten  off
onto one of the many well traveled elk trails in the area, we headed  uphill
to the saddle just SW of the summit hoping to pick up the trail again  here.
At the saddle we could find no real obvious built  trail.   So  second,  the
Bismarck Pk trail no longer goes all the way to the  summit,  at  least  not
that we could find. We wandered around a bit, somewhat right of  the  ridge,
from faint animal trail to faint animal trail hoping  to  run  across  built
trail until finally giving up and just heading  uphill  on  steep  dirt  and
talus to the summit at 1:30 (7.5 miles, 5000 ft).

There had been a register at one time on the summit,  but  it  was  now  non
functional. The main body of the plastic tube was intact, but  the  cap  had
been shattered and the contents were missing. I added a  small  register  of
mine placing it wholly inside the bigger tube. The fog had lifted so we  did
have views, but it was still  cloudy  and  a  cold  wind  was  blowing.   We
actually got cold.

After eating lunch we turned our attention to the ridge leading north to  Mt
Aix. The first order of business was  to  access  it.   The  north  side  of
Bismarck is quite cliffy.  So we descended the SW ridge to 7100 ft where  we
could then traverse back to the N ridge. The first part of the ridge  to  Pt
7151 was rocky, but a traverse  on  the  west  side  bypassed  most  of  the
difficulties with easy scrambling. Pt 7335 was also bypassed on the left  by
an unpleasant traverse  on  loose  scree.  Thankfully,  a  few  goat  trails
appeared to help out. The next bump was bypassed on the right  but  we  went
over the top of Pt 7495. A final short uphill section and we hit the Mt  Aix
trail at 5:00 (11 miles, 6100 ft).

All that remained to complete a most satisfactory day trip  was  to  descent
the 5 miles down the well used Mt Aix trail, then close the loop by  a  very
short walk along the road back to the Pear Butte TH and the car.

Total: 16 miles, 6100 feet and 11.5 hours - Fay Pullen

Goode Mountain (9200+ feet) via SW Couloir and Storm King Mountain (8520
feet) July 27-30, 2004

Goode is another one of those mountains that I dreamed about for  years  but
never thought myself  capable  of  climbing  alone.  However,  after  recent
successes on other  peaks  (notably  Jack),  I  felt  ready  physically  and
mentally to give it a try. Now I am glad I waited so I could also add  Storm
King to the agenda. Storm King had not been  on  my  radar  screen  until  I
became interested in the Bulger Peaks in the last  year.  But  the  question
remained as to how  to  approach  the  mountain.  The  usual  approach  from
Stehekin has been lengthened this year by the flood of October 2003  washing
out the road. As a result the NPS shuttle  is  not  running  and  the  lower
valley shuttle stops 1.5 miles below High Bridge.  This all  adds  some  6.5
miles to the normal approach.  Considering this and the hassle  and  expense
of getting to Stehekin and being tied to the boat  schedule,  I  decided  to
start from Bridge Cr on  the  North  Cascades  highway  even  though  it  is
longer.

Day 1.  I got out of the house reasonably  early  but  had  several  delays.
First it took 30 minutes to get my permit from the Marblemount  RS.   I  was
the only one there but the  lone  ranger  on  duty  kept  being  interrupted
answering the phone.  Why is  it  that  phone  calls  always  seem  to  take
precedence over people in person?  Then I was  stopped  another  30  minutes
where they are repairing the road at  the  rockslide  between  Newhalem  and
Diablo. So by the time I was able to start from the  Bridge  Cr  TH  it  was
already 11:00 AM.

I decided to experiment on this trip with hiking  in  most  of  the  way  in
light trail shoes. I thought they would allow me to go faster and be  easier
on aching feet.  The downside was I had to carry my climbing  boots.  I  was
also carrying 10 pounds of climbing gear, including ice axe, rock  gear  and
a 50 meter skinny rope, and food for 5 days.  I went as light as I dared  on
personal gear and clothing, but this all added up to over 40 pounds of  pack
weight, very heavy for me.

The Bridge Cr trail is mostly gently downhill,  with  a  few  ups  here  and
there, all the way the 13 miles to the Stehekin  road  and  my  trail  shoes
seemed light as a feather to feet used to heavy climbing boots,  so  I  made
reasonable time to start despite the heavy load. I reached the road at  5:00
having taken a long rest at lovely Maple Cr (at 8 miles) to  soak  my  feet.
At 6:00 I was at the Park Cr trail, after walking  the  road  2  miles,  and
started uphill.  Near the junction I heard  a  crashing  in  the  woods  and
looked up in time to see a bear running  away.   My  permit  for  the  first
night was Two Mile camp, which was, surprisingly  enough,  2  miles  up  the
trail. Here the heat, the heavy pack and the steep trail conspired  to  slow
me down, and it wasn\'t until 7:30 that I reached camp  (17  miles,  2000  ft
and 8.5 hours). The camp was affected by flooding, but  there  was  still  a
nice level sandy spot right by Park Cr to put my  bivy  tent  and  a  usable
toilet nearby. I washed my sweaty, dusty body and filthy feet and  socks  in
the creek.  Another downside to light shoes - they  let  in  all  manner  of
trail dirt.

Day 2 - Storm King.  I was on my  way  the  next  morning  by  7:00,  having
stashed my shoes and switched to boots. Right out of camp the trail  crossed
Park Cr on a good log.  About 2 miles farther the trail was  obliterated  by
a massive washout of huge boulders and debris coming  down  the  creek  that
drains the SW side of Goode. On the other side the trail  enters  the  woods
and a  cairn  marks  where  to  leave  it  and  start  uphill.  I  found  no
discernable path at the cairn and thought it too far  into  the  woods.   My
recommendation is to leave the trail just  inside  the  woods  where  travel
looks reasonable and head uphill.  Soon you will run into the good  climbers
trail that follows along the rib just to the left of the washout  creek  and
ravine.

I left the Park Cr trail at 8:30 and began the slow hot plod 3000 ft  uphill
plagued by obnoxious flies most of the way. The climber\'s  trail  was  quite
good as climber\'s trails go. After following along the wooded rib  for  1700
ft, at 5600 ft the trail traversed left into meadows and  petered  out.  But
the going was easy enough up the meadows to the crest of  another  ridge  to
the left. I found nice flat places to camp at about 6600ft but there was  no
water. Soon the ridge steepened and  became  rocky  and  a  climber\'s  trail
again appeared.  I traversed right below cliffs toward a  waterfall  and  at
noon found a wonderful campsite at 7200 ft on a narrow heather bench at  the
base of talus directly below Goode\'s SW face (4 miles, 3850 ft,  5  hrs).  I
had a great view up to the SW couloir,  the  Black  Tooth,  two  fascinating
spires off to the left with a  giant  chockstone  wedged  between  them  and
across to the north face of Booker and east face of Buckner.

I set up camp, ate lunch, replenished  my  water,  rested  a  bit  and  then
started for Storm King at 1:40. I climbed to  a  flat  talus  basin  200  ft
above my camp and then began a mile long  traverse,  first  up  and  over  a
minor rib, on a mostly level snow bench until I could round  a  corner  into
the basin below Storm King\'s twin towers. The eastern tower is the  highest.
I headed for the notch just right of  the  eastern  (right  most)  tower  on
increasingly loose and unpleasant scree. At the base of  the  gully  leading
to the notch I roped up. The gully itself was very loose and  looked  awful,
becoming steep to overhanging near the top. About  half  way  up  I  climbed
onto the right wall where the rock was not as steep and was  a  little  more
solid. From the notch (rappel slings here) a wide  sandy  ledge  led  across
the NE face.  I went  the  full  length  of  my  rope  before  stopping  and
returning to my starting point. Remember that solo roped  climbing  requires
each pitch to be climbed twice in order to retrieve the rope.

I was  trying  to  follow  the  route  directions  in  Washington\'s  Highest
Mountains but they were  completely  incomprehensible  to  me  and  made  no
sense, something about continuing the traverse all the  way  around  to  the
notch between the twin towers and climbing from the other side.  Forget  all
that. From the end of my first pitch it was an easy scramble directly up  to
the summit ridge at a minor notch. Here a 20 ft  easy  crack  (which  I  did
protect) led the final bit to the summit at 6:00. The register was  a  glass
jar placed in 1988. There were only a dozen  or  so  entries.  I  signed  in
after Don Beavon\'s entry of 8/12/03. I actually found Don\'s trip  report  of
last year more helpful, even though he climbed from the west side.   I  have
great respect for the fact  that  he  climbed  both  east  and  west  towers
unroped.

There was a rappel sling almost  at  the  summit  that  would  have  got  me
directly down to the sandy ledge very near my gully notch, but  I  had  left
my pack below the crack and so had to go back  down  that  way.  I  couldn\'t
find a good anchor to rappel the crack and so ended up down climbing it  and
the rest of the way to the notch, from which I then rappelled  to  the  base
of the gully. On down  terrible  scree  where  often  it  seemed  the  whole
mountain was moving with me and back to camp at  8:30  (3  miles,  1200  ft,
6:50 hr RT). I ate dinner watching a fiery sun set over  Mt  Buckner  and  a
full moon rise in the opposite direction. Pure magic. Well,  it  would  have
been pure magic except for the voracious mosquitoes.  Despite being  covered
head to toe in clothing and head net they still found places to drill me.  I
do believe bugs have been put on this earth to remind us when we are  having
way too much fun.

Day 3 - Goode Mountain.  I was on my way again at 7:00 AM. Back to the  flat
basin then up a yucky scree slope to the "pocket glacier" (looked like  just
a regular snow slope to me) above and up the snow to the  ridge  to  the  SE
and easy scrambling along this ridge heading for the deep  slot  of  the  SW
couloir. At the base of the cliffs above,  a  ledge  led  into  the  couloir
proper at 8500 ft. I found the couloir to be a fascinating  place  and  much
friendlier than I had expected. I stayed on the left side  mostly  following
the  stair  steps  of  a  black  dike  that,  compared  to  earlier  terrain
(especially on Storm King), was reasonably solid  and  pleasant  scrambling.
The scrambling ended at the left edge of  a  black  sloping  ledge  (with  a
rappel boulder) below a white slab at 8900 ft. Here I roped up.

I first traversed onto the black ledge and reset my anchor on  the  boulder.
I then climbed a crack on the left side of the white slab and  traversed  to
the right below a crack at the top. This  slab  gave  me  a  great  deal  of
trouble and was much harder than anticipated. I hate slabs. I  am  not  very
good at them and they are difficult to protect. That is why I  followed  the
cracks - to provide protection.  The problem was, this forced  me  onto  the
steepest and smoothest part of the slab. I am  now  thinking  perhaps  there
was an easier route to the right. At any event, it took me over an  hour  to
climb the thing and it was at my technical limit.

Once across the slab, easy scramble terrain led past another rappel  boulder
up a shallow gully to the Black Tooth notch. From the notch, a  sandy  ledge
led across the NE face to connect with the upper part of  the  NE  buttress.
This was the only other place to give me  trouble.   Although  most  of  the
ledge was easy, it was very exposed and there was  an  8-foot  awkward  step
down where if you lost it you would end up  2000  feet  down  on  the  Goode
Glacier. I took time to protect this section going in both directions.

Once on the NE buttress there were two more pitches of enjoyable  class  3-4
climbing on solid blocky rock, passing two  rappel  slings.  I  reached  the
spacious summit, where several bivy sites had been leveled,  at  1:45.   The
view from the top was not that great as it was very hazy from all the  fires
in the area, but I could clearly see the near peaks of Booker,  Buckner  and
Logan. The summit register was an official fat mountaineer roll that  barely
fit inside a narrow diameter metal tube.  The last  party  to  sign  it  had
unthinkingly pushed it all the way to the bottom of the tube  where  it  was
impossible to get out with fingers. Now, there was no way  I  was  going  to
climb this mountain and not sign the register, but it was a  real  challenge
to get the thing out. I finally succeeded by  bending  a  large  safety  pin
from my first aid kit into a hook and snagging the paper to pull it out.  It
had been placed in 2002 and already  had  many  entries.   The  most  recent
parties were the previous weekend, one via the SW couloir and other via  the
NE buttress. When replacing the register I was careful  to  leave  it  flush
with the lip of the container so the next party could get it out.

Two rappels got me to the sandy ledge, where I  again  protected  the  step,
and two more rappels from the Black Tooth notch got me to the  base  of  the
white slab, all of which took 2 hours. In another 1.5 hours I  was  back  in
camp, again plagued by mosquitoes but a very happy climber. (2  miles,  2250
ft, 11 hours RT)

Day 4.  The less said about this day the better. It was a long, hot,  dusty,
foot aching, mind numbing hike out that seemed to go on  forever.  I  wasn\'t
even sure I would be able to get out in one day and was  prepared  to  spend
another night if need be. I did make it, though. I  retrieved  my  shoes  at
Two Mile camp but kept my boots on till past the Stehekin  road.  I  stopped
twice to soak my feet in cool streams and took a long rest for  lunch.  Much
of the way back was gently but annoyingly uphill. I left  camp  at  7:00  AM
and dragged into the Bridge Cr TH a little after 7 PM, more than  ready  for
my adventure to end. (21 miles, 3400 ft, 12 hours).

Grand Total: 47 miles and 12,700 ft.

The Triad (USGS Eldorado Pk) - What a splendid climb this turned out  to  be
- highly recommended.  I am sure this peak can and has  been  climbed  in  a
day from the TH, but I wanted to savor the beauty of this high  country  and
so opted for a more leisurely 2-day trip with a  camp  at  Sibely  Cr  Pass.
Since the pass is right on the  boundary  of  the  North  Cascades  National
Park, I wasn\'t sure if I needed a permit to camp there,  but  just  to  make
sure I stopped at the ranger station to inquire.  They felt one was  needed.


Beginning from the Hidden Lake Peak TH, it was only  3  miles,  2600  ft  of
gain and 2:30 hrs to the pass, so despite a late start I arrived  in  plenty
of time to set of camp and lounge around before turning in  early  at  8:00.
I wasn\'t sure how camping would be at the pass, but  in  fact  there  was  a
large flat area for a tent and a snowpatch nearby for water  and  of  course
glorious views toward Sahale and Cascade Pass and  the  three  peaks  of  my
objective. Perfect!

I began the next morning at 7:30, following a  delightful  way  trail  north
and east that wandered up and down along the ridge through  glorious  alpine
terrain. I thought I was in heaven. The way trail ended at a notch where  it
was necessary to drop a bit on the north side and traverse on  snow  to  the
6700 ft notch SW of Pt 6804, marked by a large  cairn.   This  traverse  was
easy enough although the first part was icy enough that crampons felt  good.


From the notch a class 3 gully led down the south side  to  talus  and  snow
below.  A traverse at about 6340 ft rounded a rocky  spur  and  brought  the
Triad back into view. From here I  worked  my  way  down  a  bit  more  then
traversed right to the snowfield directly below the peak  and up  to  the  S
ridge of the E peak.  Now the fun began as I followed  a  broad  ledge  past
the E peak to the gully below the notch with the Middle Pk  (the highest  of
the three peaks), then a slab to the notch  itself.   An  exposed  pitch  up
from the notch and around  the  corner  on  the  S  (class  4)  bypassing  a
pinnacle led to more ledges and heather slopes and the summit ridge.  I  was
on the narrow top at noon (4:30 hrs and 1450 ft  from  Sibely  Cr  Pass),  a
most pleasant climb.

My route, except for the climb of the  Triad  itself,  is  part  of  a  high
alpine traverse that goes  between  the  Hidden  Lake  Peak  trail  and  the
Cascade River road.  From my perch I now had a  splendid  view  of  Eldorado
and the rest of this traverse.  It made me want to continue  on.  But  alas,
this was not to be,  at  least  not  this  day.  So  I  descended  my  route
(required a couple of rappels) and retraced my steps back to my  camp  (8:00
hrs and 2500 ft total RT).  I spent another couple  hours  relaxing  in  the
sun before beginning the short trip out to the TH. 12  miles,  5100  ft,   -

Mt Logan (USGS Mt Logan, GT Diablo Dam & Mt Logan) - I have had  my  eye  on
this peak for some time, but I had  trouble  facing  the  long  approach  up
Thunder Cr. In fact it turned out to not be as bad  as  anticipated  despite
neglecting to read the map in detail and noticing that  part  of  the  trail
descends almost 1000ft on the way in losing hard gained elevation.

Stopping at the Marblemont RS for the fourth time  in  as  many  weeks,  the
rangers there were getting to know me by name.   There  was,  however,  some
confusion as to which campsite we wanted. I wanted the Upper  Thunder  Basin
Camp, but it doesn\'t seem to be very  well  differentiated  from  the  Lower
Thunder Basin Camp, which is supposedly a horse camp, nor is  it\'s  location
well defined.  All I knew is that it was higher  than  the  lower  one.  The
rangers didn\'t seem to know either. This bit of confusion  would  return  to
haunt us. Also, there was a new face behind the counter and  who  should  it
turn out to be but the ranger who had given me  a  hard  time  the  previous
week at Cascade Pass.  He recognized me  and  reintroduced  himself  as  the
ranger who had hassled me. He was properly contrite and we  had  a  pleasant
conversation as I told him how my climb of Buckner and Booker had  gone.  He
wished me a good time on Logan. All was forgiven.

And so Linda and I started up the long Thunder Cr  trail  at  10:45  in  hot
sunny weather and through tinder dry forest. The trail was  in  great  shape
until we entered the large expanse of Thunder Basin  where  it  deteriorated
and turned brushy.  By the time we reached the  camp  called  Thunder  Basin
Camp some 16.6 miles up the trail, just after crossing the  creek  at  7:45,
we were tempted to stop there for the night as we were both beat.  The  camp
sign gave no designation as being a horse camp. But, much to  our  surprise,
as we had seen no one on the trail for hours, the camp was already  occupied
by two fellows.  There seemed to be only  one  available  spot,  the  others
having been destroyed by  now  melting  avalanche  snow.  And  although  the
fellows seemed to think this was THE Thunder Basin Camp and even offered  to
share their site with us, we decided to push wearily onward. I felt  certain
there was a higher camp.  But  the  longer  we  went  without  running  into
anything the more doubt I had that this higher  camp  existed.  Finally,  at
8:30 and at a much higher elevation  (5200  ft)  than  I  thought  the  camp
should be, we became desperate to find a place in the fading light  to  rest
our weary bodies. Fortunately we found a reasonable spot just off the  trail
in the bushes to pitch our tent, had a quick dinner  and  collapsed  in  bed
(18 miles, 5200 ft & 9:45 hours).

Continuing up the trail the next morning  at  7:45,  within  a  few  hundred
yards we ran into the elusive Upper Thunder Basin Camp,  although  the  camp
sign listed no name. A few expletives  filled  the  air.  It  was  a  lovely
campsite with two sites and a composting toilet. We continued on  the  trail
crossing the head of the basin then  began  a  series  of  switchbacks  that
ended at a rocky meadow. Here we picked up a well-used climbers  trail  that
was easily followed until it  dead-ended  at  a  deep  ravine.  Climbing  up
alongside the ravine we ran into another good way trail at  its  top,  which
we followed as it led upward to cross a rocky  rib.  From  here  we  made  a
traverse across mixed talus and heather meadows past the  south  peak  until
we could head straight up to the edge of the Fremont Glacier.

We roped up for the glacier, crossed below the rib coming  from  the  middle
peak, and climbed a narrow strip of snow left of this rib  and  right  of  a
large expanse of bare glacier ice to the gentle snow shelf  above.   A  snow
finger gave access to a climber\'s trail up  a  slanting  rocky  gully  to  a
notch in the south ridge. From here a  most  interesting  route  followed  a
series of exposed but easy ledges on the east side to the talus slope  below
the final rock tower. A final pitch on steep but good rock and  we  were  on
top (4100 ft and 6 hrs).

We only took time to sign the summit register and for a few  quick  pictures
as we could see weather rapidly moving our way.  We  made  it  back  to  the
notch before the rain started. Thunder and lightening  accompanied  us  down
the gully where we elected to rappel the final distance to the  snow  below.
The thunderstorm increased in intensity during the trip  down  the  glacier,
but before we were back to the main trail it had quickly passed and the  sun
was once more shining.  We had a good view down  the  Thunder  Creek  valley
and were surprised to see the smoke of  three  small  fires  on  the  wooded
flank of Primus Peak.  Presumably,  these  had  just  been  started  by  the
recent lightening.  I tried to make a call with  my  cell  phone  to  report
these fires but had no reception.

Before returning to camp, we continued the  short  distance  to  Park  Creek
Pass.  We then decided to move our camp to the official site  to  spend  our
second night (4700 ft and 11 hrs total for the peak and  pass).  That  night
we went to bed dreaming about getting trapped by  raging  forest  fires.  We
needn\'t have worried.  We were soon awakened by a violent thunderstorm  with
dozens of lightening strikes and heavy rain that just  hung  over  the  area
for a couple of hours. Finally it let up, but we were  further  awakened  by
two large icefalls off the Thunder Glacier, probably  caused  by  the  heavy
rain.  A very active night.

We awoke the next morning to clearing skies but very wet brush  that  soaked
us on the hike out.  However, we were happy to see that the fires  had  been
extinguished for the most part by the heavy rain  (18  miles,  1600  ft  and
9:30 hrs out).  48 miles, 11,500 ft total, - Fay Pullen,  Kent,  8/4-6/03.

Horseshoe Peak (8480+ feet) - August 11-12, 2004


Last year I climbed Buckner and  Booker  from  a  camp  in  upper  Horseshoe
Basin.  At that time I was vaguely aware of Horseshoe Peak but  didn\'t  have
much information about it.  Descending  from  Buckner  I  looked  at  Ripsaw
Ridge but couldn\'t figure out which peak was  Horseshoe,  saw  nothing  that
had at least 400 feet of prominence and so passed it by. I later  found  out
that Horseshoe was one of the Bulger peaks even though it didn\'t  have  what
I thought was the required prominence. And so I now found  myself  returning
to Horseshoe Basin to climb this peak that  I  had  missed  the  first  time
around.

I again stopped at the Marblemount RS and got a permit to spend  two  nights
in the Buckner XC zone. I thought I could do the trip with  just  one  night
out but I wanted to allow myself plenty of time just to be sure.  I am  very
slow when doing roped solo climbing. I found out there was one  other  party
signed out for that zone. I wondered if I would run into them.

Starting at 11:30 I toiled slowly  up  the  well-trodden  trail  to  Cascade
Pass, burdened by a heavy pack, excessive heat and  biting  flies,  arriving
at the pass at 2:00. As before, I elected to approach from  lower  Horseshoe
Basin rather than over Sahale Arm, and so continued downhill  on  the  trail
toward Stehekin. A short ways below the pass I ran into  a  ranger  and  who
should he turn out to be but the one who checked me out two  weeks  ago  for
Goode.  He remembered me and asked how that climb went.  I told him  and  we
chatted for a while. Then, of course, he had to ask  if  I  had  the  proper
permits for this trip.  I think rangers are required  to  do  this.  But  he
asked politely and in a friendly  manner.   This  was  a  far  cry  from  my
experience last year when I  was  hassled  by  a  different  very  officious
ranger.  Shortly past the turnoff  to  Pelton  Basin  camp,  I  met  another
ranger and once again was asked about permits.  She too was friendly and  it
was no problem.

At the crossing of Doubtful Cr I stopped for lunch and to soak  my  feet  in
the inviting water. At 4:00 I reached the  Horseshoe  Basin  trail  junction
and started back uphill.  Near the head of the basin I  ran  into  a  couple
coming out. They were the other party signed out for this area.   They  were
trying to climb Buckner but gave up after not being able to find  the  route
from lower to upper Horseshoe Basin through the waterfall  filled  headwall.
They asked if I knew the way. I replied that I had been up it last year  but
it certainly was not obvious or easy. I told them I had gone up to the  left
of waterfalls and down to the right.  There was less brush to the  left  but
to the right was more direct. I planned to go up to the right this time.   I
tried to convince them to try again with me, that together  I  was  sure  we
could find a way up, but they were wiped out  and  psyched  out.   They  had
been going for 11 hours.  11 hours! They must have started at  6:00  in  the
morning. The fellow said they were following directions  and  GPS  waypoints
from Washington\'s Highest Mountains and were seriously  led  off  route  and
confused, battling brush for hours. I pointed out the route as best I  could
to them for a future attempt then wished them luck as  they  continued  out.
Too bad.  They seemed like a nice couple and  I  would  have  enjoyed  their
company.

At 5:00 I crossed Basin Cr by boulder hopping, getting one foot wet  in  the
process, and started up the headwall. After a short rocky  scramble  section
right above the creek, I followed a ramp toward  a  waterfall,  then  turned
right (a cairn here and odds and ends of old flagging) very  steeply  uphill
into dense scrub cedar to the left of a short cliff. Pulling  myself  bodily
up the ladder of brush, I soon emerged to more moderate terrain  and  picked
my way up avoiding more brush as much as possible. At one point I crossed  a
side creek. After about 800 ft of climbing  and  another  short  section  of
dense cedar I broke out into the open meadows of the upper  basin.  At  7:00
and 6000 ft I found a delightful level spot  on  a  slab  right  next  to  a
babbling brook to pitch my bivy tent  (10.5  miles,  3950  ft,  7.5  hrs).
Surprisingly there were no bugs and I spent a pleasant evening  enjoying  my
lovely surroundings.

I started at 7:00 the next morning,  wandering  up  heather  and  talus  and
scree toward Horseshoe and the very distinctive Lick of Flame spire  to  its
right. I was surprised at how little snow there was. At 9:00 I  reached  the
basin below these peaks and the first snow, much of which  was  melted  down
to water ice, so I stopped to put on crampons.  I probably could have  found
a way around the ice but I had lugged crampons up this far and  by  golly  I
was going to use them. I crossed the basin to the left  (west),  onto  steep
dirt to a notch on the south shoulder of  the  false  summit  of  Horseshoe,
down a few feet on the other side and around a corner  into  a  loose  sandy
gully leading to the notch between the main and false summits

At the notch I roped up and followed a ledge left across the east face to  a
final steep move to the summit ridge. The ledge  was  easy  enough  but  the
move to the ridge was a stretch for me and by this time  I  was  far  enough
out onto the east face that the drop straight down to the  gully  was  about
80 feet so I dinked around finding adequate protection. That done, I  pulled
myself over the edge right at a rappel sling wrapped around  a  large  chunk
of the narrow summit ridge.  To the right a few feet was  the  summit  cairn
and to the left a few feet was the  summit  register.  The  register  was  a
spiral notebook that was soggy and in part illegible. It was placed in  1995
and averaged one or at most two ascents a year. Some years had  no  ascents.
Once again I was the first to sign in this year right after  Don  Beavon  on
7/17/03.  I seem to be following in Don\'s footsteps on  many  peaks  lately,
though not deliberately.

The tiny summit was not  conducive  to  hanging  around,  so  after  briefly
taking in the views for 10 minutes (I was particularly interested in  Boston
Peak, still on my to do list.  It didn\'t look so bad from  this  aspect),  I
started down at 11:00. I had only brought a 120 ft rope  that  didn\'t  reach
all the way straight down to the gully, so after  rappelling  the  step  off
the ridge, I downclimbed the ledge back to the notch.  Another  rappel  from
the notch got me down the worst of the gully. I was back in camp at 1:00  (2
miles, 2350 ft, 6 hrs), early enough to continue out this day.

I started out at 2:30 and did a slightly better  job  of  routefinding  down
the headwall, avoiding all the brush except that particularly bad  patch  of
scrub cedar near the bottom. Slithering through that awful  stuff,  dangling
off brush belays I lost a water bottle out of the mesh  side  pocket  of  my
pack. It wasn\'t so much the loss of the bottle that bothered me  as  it  was
the loss of the grape cytomax  inside.  My  dry  thirsty  mouth  was  really
looking forward to that drink.

I reached the Horseshoe Basin trail at 4:00, the Stehekin trail at 4:45  and
started the hot grind back up to Cascade Pass. I  couldn\'t  resist  stopping
once again at Doubtful Cr to soak my feet. Just before Cascade  Pass  I  ran
into the female ranger I had met on the way in.  She seemed genuinely  happy
that I was successful and had made it out  O.K.  She  had  seen  the  couple
coming out the previous evening.  She offered to let  them  stay  at  Pelton
but they elected to go all the way to the TH, a very long day. She was  also
interested in how to get from lower to upper Horseshoe Basin stating that  I
was the only person she knew who had done it.  I replied that probably  most
parties climbing Buckner or Horseshoe approach from Sahale  Arm.  I  reached
Cascade Pass at 7:00, where I took a short rest, and the TH at  8:30  (10.5
miles, 1700 ft, 6 hrs)

Grand Total: 23 miles, 8000 ft

Mt  Cameron  (USGS  Wellesley  Pk,  Maiden  Pk)  -  After  stopping  at  the
Wilderness Center in Port Angeles for our permit, Linda and I  started  from
the Obstruction Pt TH at 11:00.  This was to be  one  of  those  upside-down
trips that starts high and descends before climbing again - twice - down  to
Grand Valley, up to Grand Pass, down (very steeply) to Cameron Cr and up  to
Cameron Basin, our destination for the night (11 miles, 3300 ft, 6.5  hrs).
We were entertained that evening by a  curious  deer  wandering  around  our
campsite.

The next morning found us ambling through lovely upper Cameron Basin and  up
to Cameron Pass. In this summer of little snow and never-ending  warm  sunny
days, the usual snowfield guarding the pass was much diminished  and  easily
avoided.  From the pass we descended again into Lost Basin,  then  traversed
to Lost Pass.  Here we left the trail and followed the ridge  north  to  the
summit of Lost Pk (2200 ft, 3:15 hrs).  Lost Pk is listed  in  the  Climbers
Guide to the Olympic Mountains as class 1, but  the  final  scramble  has  a
short section I would rate class 2 or even class 3. Not too surprising as  I
find this guide consistently underrates climbs, at least by my standards.

On top we were surprised to meet a fellow who had  just  done  the  traverse
from Cameron in the opposite direction we were planning  on  doing  it.   He
gave us a few useful pointers, signed both the register  I  was  placing  on
Lost Pk and the one I planned to place on Cameron, and then headed  down  to
Lost Pass.

From Lost Pk a detour to the east was necessary to avoid cliffs. As soon  as
possible we then traversed  north  and  gained  the  connecting  ridge  with
Cameron, which we easily followed to the middle peak.  Mt Cameron  is  rated
class 2, but again this rating seemed low.  The  traverse  from  the  middle
peak to the main peak turned out to be a bit tricky over fractured rock  and
loose gullies. I then climbed the final tower  from  the  east  up  a  short
class 4 pitch with suspect loose blocks only to discover, once on top,  that
a walkup route existed from the west. Linda easily summited from  that  side
(3600 ft, 6 hrs).

Using the information from the Lost Pk fellow,  we  continued  west  on  the
ridge by going over the top of the next pinnacle.   Although  this  pinnacle
looked gnarly from Cameron, it actually was quite easy and the best  way  to
go. The rest of the ridge back to Cameron Pass was straightforward on  scree
and talus. We had a tiny glissade down from the pass on the small  snowfield
and were back in camp by 5:30 (8 miles, 3900 ft, 8.5  hrs).   The  resident
deer once again kept us company during the evening.

On our trip out the next day, on the climb up to  Grand  Pass,  two  fellows
passed us doing the loop trip from Deer Park to Cameron  Cr  to  Obstruction
Pt to Deer Park in one day (over 25 miles).  We also met a ranger who  hoped
we were the two women who were reported overdue  by  two  days  coming  from
the Enchanted Valley. She was very disappointed when we  told  her  we  were
not they. (We later discovered they were  found  the  next  day,  tired  and
hungry.  They had lost the trail somewhere near Cameron  Pass  and  wandered
around in the Lost Cr drainage.)

At Moose Lake we stopped for a  quick  dip  before  the  final  pull  up  to
Obstruction Pt, but the water was too cold for a real swim, even for  Linda.
 Climbing out of Grand Valley we were  passed  once  again  by  one  of  the
fellows doing the Deer Park loop. His companion had given  up  due  to  knee
problems and was bailing out at Obstruction Pt. How we got  ahead  of  these
guys again I am not sure.  11 miles, 4000 ft and  7:15  hrs  to  Obstruction

Day 1 - Osceola Peak: With showers predicted for the next  several  days,  I
headed for the hopefully drier Pasayten Wilderness.  I  had  never  been  to
Harts Pass and was very impressed with this high  mountain  road,  but  also
wondered why it was ever built and how much money it must cost  to  maintain
it.  Whatever the reason I  was  happy  to  use  it  to  get  closer  to  my
objectives and I enjoyed the beautiful views (except  for  the  recent  burn
just before the pass). From Harts Pass I drove toward Slate Peak and  parked
at the second switchback and the start of  the  Buckskin  trail  just  below
Slate Pass at 6900 ft.

Due to the long drive it was almost noon as  I  started  up  the  trail  the
short distance to the Pass.  It was sunny and  warm  to  begin,  but  clouds
were already beginning to form.  On  the  other  side  the  trail  descended
easily through lovely meadows to a junction with the  Middle  Fork  Pasayten
River trail, then more steeply down, down, down to a crossing of the  river.
More gentle downhill for miles along the river, past the Robinson  Pass  and
Ferguson Lake trails, to the junction with the trail to  Shellrock  Pass  at
5000 ft. Now back uphill to Freds Lake where it began to rain lightly.  More
uphill to Freds saddle crossing into the Eureka Cr  drainage  where  shortly
beyond I picked up the side trail to Doris Lake at 7000 ft and  camp.  (12.5
miles, 2700 ft, 5:40 hrs)

Most accommodatingly, the rain had stopped, making it much more pleasant  to
set up my tent. At 6:10 I started for Osceola  Pk.   There  were  two  other
parties camped at the lake but I only stopped to chat briefly  as  I  didn\'t
have much time to make my summit before dark. From the lake I made a  rising
rightward traverse toward the ridge until I  could  climb  directly  up  the
steep talus of the SW slope to the summit at 7:10 (1700 ft, 1  hr).  A  cold
wind was blowing but it still wasn\'t raining.  There was no  register  so  I
left one. I was back to the lake (2.5 miles, 2 hr RT) just as  it  got  dark
enough to need a headlamp. Passing  the  tent  of  a  couple,  this  time  I
stopped to chat. They were happy to see I was back safely from my  mad  dash
up Osceola. Immediately they asked me if I knew Grant Myers, with whom  they
were friends, and when I said yes, they were  not  surprised,  as  dedicated
peak baggers frequently know of each  other.  This  was  their  third  night
camped at the lake and they were headed out the next day. They professed  to
not be scramblers but could have fooled me  as  they  had  climbed  Osceola,
Lago and Rolo during their stay. I also passed the  second  party  and  they
too were glad I was back safe  and  sound.  How  nice  that  strangers  were
kindly keeping track of me.

By the time I got water from the lake and retreated into  my  tent  to  make
dinner it was raining again. But I  was  cozy  and  comfortable  in  my  new
Montbell tent. Expecting rain I had brought this tent to try  out.  This  is
the lightest double wall single person tent  that  I  have  found  that  has
enough room to sit up in comfortably and has no mesh in the inner walls.  It
cleverly uses only one pole and weighs under 3 pounds. I  was  very  pleased
with its performance, as I stayed dry and toasty during  a  night  of  heavy
rain and strong winds and had plenty of room to cook inside.

Day 2 - Mt Carru, Mt Lago, Blackcap  Mtn:  The  rain  had  diminished  to  a
drizzle when I started for these three peaks at 7:30 the next  morning.  But
the brush was saturated, so after an hour or so my  feet  were  soaking  wet
and I continued to slosh in soggy socks the rest of the  day.   Why  oh  why
didn\'t I wear my Gore-Tex boots? I began by descending  to  the  main  trail
and following it maybe Â½ mile to a switchback. The trail drops some  800  ft
from this point to Eureka Cr. I  hoped  to  avoid  this  elevation  loss  by
climbing directly up to the W ridge of Carru.  I\'m  not  sure  I  saved  any
time or energy doing this but it made for a  much  more  interesting  route.
From the switchback I climbed up heather and meadows  to  the  saddle  below
the boilerplate cliffs of Osceola\'s E face. Trying to avoid  gaining  excess
elevation over Pt 7929, I was able to traverse  downward  between  7600  and
7400 ft on the S slope until I was past a  second  bump  on  the  ridge  and
could access the SW ridge of Carru.  Once on this ridge I worked my  way  up
talus and broken rock into loose gullies leading  past  small  pinnacles  to
the W ridge. Drizzle had now changed to light snow and  fog.  Wet,  slippery
black lichen covered rock made the traverse along the narrow ridge  somewhat
treacherous the last bit to the summit (3 miles, 2370 ft, 3:15 hr). A  large
register placed 7/21/93 by Mike Torok graced the summit  cairn.  There  were
only a few ascents each year and I recognized  entries  by  Don  and  Natala
Goodman (9/7/93), Mitch Blanton (8/21/95), Paul  Klenke  (8/21/01)  and  Don
Beavon (7/9/03). Mine was only the second ascent this year  after  one  made
just two days earlier on 9/7/04.

From the summit I continued down the normal ascent route along the  E  ridge
then descended S alongside cliffs to 7100 ft to get past a  rocky  buttress.
Crossing well below the Carru-Lago saddle, I climbed up to  the  S  spur  of
Lago and picked up a faint way trail that came and went. Fresh  tracks  were
probably made by the Doris Lake couple. I made the summit of  Lago  at  1:25
(5 miles, 4000 ft, 5:55 hr) where another register placed by Mike  Torok  on
the same day as Carru awaited me.  Lago is climbed more  often  than  Carru,
probably because it is higher, and  there  were  several  entries  for  2004
alone, plus all those who had signed in on the previous  peak.  The  weather
was now improving, it had stopped precipitating and views were beginning  to
appear.  Before I left I could see the summits of Osceola, Carru,  Ptarmigan
and Blackcap, my next objective.

To get to Blackcap I had hoped to traverse as high  as  possible  SE  toward
Shellrock Pass. But surveying the terrain between me  and  the  pass  I  was
dismayed at how unfriendly it looked. Several  ugly  gullies  and  frightful
rocky ribs stood in the way. Yet descending back the way I had come  and  on
down to the trail was not appealing either. So I decided to stick  with  the
original plan and let the chips fall where they may.  It would  either  play
out or it wouldn\'t. I began by following the SE  ridge  on  the  very  crest
until past the first gully. I was then able to descend  a  rib  between  two
gullies S down to about 7200  ft  at  which  point  I  could  begin  a  long
descending traverse across several more gullies and talus slope after  talus
slope to finally end up in the meadows below the pass at 7000  ft.   Shortly
after I ran into the trail which I followed only  a  short  distance  before
leaving it at a switchback and beginning the  climb  to  the  notch  in  the
ridge just E of Blackcap. More talus, but this talus was actually fun for  a
while as it consisted of large flat stable white rocks that I  could  almost
dance across. Alas,  the  talus  turned  more  unpleasant  and  loose  as  I
approached the notch.

From the notch, I scrambled the narrow ridge or just left of it to a  higher
notch below the final summit rocks. A short class 3 scramble put me  on  top
of Blackcap at 5:00 (8 miles, 5360 ft, 9:30 hr). I  was  thankful  that  the
rocks on this final bit had dried out in  the  now  sunny  weather.  Another
Mike Torok register awaited me on the summit, but this one had  been  placed
on a different outing from Lago and Carru on 7/3/95. I didn\'t take the  time
to peruse it very closely but did note that the  peak  wasn\'t  climbed  that
often, there being only one entry for 2003 and mine the only one  for  2004.
The only other entry that caught my  eye  was  Mitch  Blanton\'s  of  8/21/95
where he had already climbed Osceola, Carru and Lago  and  was  then  on  to
Lake! And I thought I was doing well to get three peaks in a day.

I quickly left hoping I could get back to camp before dark.  I  didn\'t  make
it. I hit the trail at 6:20 thinking I had  it  made.   But  parts  of  this
trail are very faint, especially through  meadows  where  it  is  marked  by
cairns, and at times I was in danger of losing  it.  It  would  be  hard  to
follow in the dark. The trail dropped to 5800 ft, then climbed 1200 ft  back
to Doris Lake.  During the last part I had to use my  headlamp  reaching  my
tent at 8:30 (15 miles, 6600 ft, 13 hrs).

Day 3 - Mt Rolo: That night was cold and  clear  with  a  light  frost,  the
first for me of the season. I was packed and on  my  way  by  8:30.  At  the
saddle overlooking Freds Lake, I stashed my  overnight  pack  and  continued
with a very light daypack. From there I  contoured  around  Pt  7442  on  an
unpleasant traverse, to the broad saddle N of the peak  where  there  was  a
dried up tarn. I picked up a climber\'s trail that led up meadows  and  talus
to the N ridge at a notch. I slipped a few times before realizing there  was
a light coating of frost on the rocks still  in  the  shade  that  warranted
careful foot placement. A steep step with class 3 scrambling led to  a  flat
shoulder and more talus to a  second  notch.  From  here  the  summit  block
looked quite formidable, but a traverse on the W  side  gave  access  to  an
easy scree slope that put me back on the ridge and a third notch.  This  was
turning out to be a  much  more  interesting  climb  than  I  had  expected.
Another traverse on the W and a steep loose gully put me  on  top  at  10:00
(1200 ft, 1 hr). Although there were signs that this peak is often  climbed,
with a discernable climber\'s trail most of the way, there was  no  register,
so I left one.

I was back to my overnight pack by 11:20 (2.5 miles RT),  climbing  over  Pt
7442 this time to avoid the unpleasant traverse around  it.   I  relaxed  in
the sun eating lunch and enjoying the sunny views before starting  the  trip
out at 12:00. During the hike out, the weather gradually  deteriorated.   By
the time I reached the car at 5:45,  it  had  begun  to  rain  again.  (12.5
miles, 2500 ft, 6:00 hr total from Lake Doris).

Grand Total: 45 miles and 14,700 feet

Lake Mountain (8371) and Monument Peak (8592) - September 15-17, 2004


With another week  of  unsettled  weather  predicted  it  was  back  to  the
Pasayten Wilderness again where if the weather didn\'t  turn  out  to  be  an
improvement over the West side at least the peaks are generally easy  enough
to be done in any event, or so I thought.  It was also the  opening  day  of
the High Hunt on September 15.  For these reasons I chose  the  Monument  Cr
trail which I knew would not be accessible to  horse  packers  and  hunters.
Even so I ran into one horse party camped at Eureka Cr  about  4  miles  in.
The trail to this point, which I reached at 1:00 (450 ft, 1:40  hr),  is  in
very good shape and a pleasure to hike, even in the  light  rain  I  had  to
start. From here on the trail is unmaintained and impassible to horses.

After a quick lunch at the  sturdy  bridge  over  Eureka  Cr,  I  began  the
grueling climb of some 4000 ft up the ridge  between  that  creek  and  Lost
River. At least it wasn\'t hot, even though it had  quit  raining  and  there
were now even a few sun breaks.   The  trail  began  with  long  switchbacks
across talus, but soon  deteriorated  to  a  steep  track  straight  up  the
hillside. After about 2000 ft gain, the ridge leveled out  briefly  where  I
lost the trail in thick wet snowbrush. I thrashed  around  a  bit,  but  was
soon back on track for another 1000 ft of steep gain after which  the  ridge
laid back for a couple of miles of gentler  ascent.  On  this  section  many
small downed crisscrossed trees made for tedious progress. At  an  elevation
of 6400 ft, the  trail  began  a  long,  seemingly  endless,  traverse  left
beneath Pistols Peaks before making the final 600 ft climb  to  Pistol  Pass
at 7000 ft. The trail on this traverse is in very good shape. Too  bad  this
trail is now unmaintained. Much of the tread is still quite  good  and  with
minimal work and log cutting it could be made very usable again.

More good trail descended the other side of the pass  in  long  switchbacks.
Here I ran into remnants of fresh snow. I left  the  trail  at  one  of  the
switchbacks after the slope lessened and I could  begin  traversing  through
open forest to Lake of the Woods which is 600 ft below and .7 mile from  the
pass.  I later found out that a way trail leads to  the  lake  from  farther
down the trail.  This junction is lower than the lake, so one has  to  climb
back up to it, but it avoids some of the steep  sidehill  I  encountered.  I
arrived at the lovely lake at 7:00 (12 miles, 5500 ft, 7:40 hr) just  as  it
began to rain again and with just enough light to set  up  camp.  It  rained
steadily most of that night.

I awoke the next morning to cloudy skies but no rain and  enough  visibility
to see where I was going. I left camp at 8:00 heading for  the  E  ridge  of
Lake Mountain through open woods and talus. A mostly solid gully with  rocky
ledges provided a fun scramble to the ridge.  The higher I climbed the  more
snow I encountered, but  it  didn\'t  present  any  great  problems  on  this
section. At 9:45 I topped out on the summit of Lake  (1750  ft,  1:45).  The
register was placed 5/29/88 by the  BoeAlps.   I  had  trouble  opening  the
screw lid as it was  frozen  shut.   I  was  finally  able  to  open  it  by
breathing on the threads and melting the ice. The booklet  inside  was  damp
and rather fragile so I didn\'t examine it closely. I did note Don Beavon  on
8/9/03 and two climbs for 2004.

I was now a little uncertain how to proceed to Monument. I had Don\'s  report
of last year where he climbed the E ridge. But that is rated class  3-4  and
Don stated he had to take care on it so I knew I didn\'t want  try  it  under
the present wet conditions.  I also had the route described in  Washington\'s
Highest Mountains, but that involved descending a disheartening 2000  ft  to
access the S ridge at 6400 ft.  I had hoped to find a way onto the  S  ridge
higher up (Beckey mentions a vague gully at 7800 ft) and to locate  a  route
visually from Lake, but the upper part of Monument was shrouded in  fog  and
I couldn\'t see anything. Well, I would just begin  by  descending  Lake\'s  N
ridge and hope something would work out.

Just getting off of Lake was not that easy.  I began down the  N  ridge  but
was soon stopped by icy ledges at a rappel sling. Under dry conditions  they
looked like they could be downclimbed, but I wasn\'t going to risk  it  under
the current conditions. This was one time, trying to save weight, I did  not
bring a thin rope. I was beginning to regret this decision. I  would  regret
it even more later. Although these are just scrambles  I  should  have  know
better.  Even Don took a rope along, just in case.

So it was back uphill to find a safer way down, which  I  did  more  to  the
west, though I still ran into some iced up rock. Eventually I worked my  way
back to the N ridge below the difficulties and followed this  ridge  to  the
head of the basin below Monument.  By now visibility  was  improving  and  I
thought I could see a broad gully that would get me onto the  S  ridge,  but
as I traversed around the head of the basin at the  base  of  the  cliffs  I
couldn\'t locate anything that seemed reasonable.  All I  saw  was  an  awful
looking rocky headwall. Continuing the traverse, I did come to  a  break  in
the cliffs, though I don\'t think this was what I saw from afar.  Once  below
it, I saw it was a steep narrow gully, definitely class  4  at  least,  that
looked like it might go, but I wasn\'t sure.  Did I  really  want  to  commit
myself to this thing without a rope?  I considered my options.  There  might
be another gully farther downhill. Then again there might not.  Or  I  could
descend all the way to  toe  of  the  ridge  at  6400  ft  from  my  present
elevation of 7900 ft, a sure but unappealing option.  In the end  I  decided
to give the gully a try.

I climbed into the gully and up a few feet to check it out. It  only  looked
a hundred feet or so to the ridge crest.  But soon the gully  steepened  and
I was forced onto the right wall on broken rock.  The rock was wet  but  not
icy, so I continued up slowly and carefully, testing each  hold.  I  knew  I
was running it out and with each move it  would  become  harder  to  reverse
myself if I reached an impasse.  I still couldn\'t see if  the  very  top  of
the gully would go. I would have felt so much better if only  I  had  had  a
rope to facilitate retreat. I worked my way back into the  gully  above  the
vertical section and finally saw the final  bit  was  an  8  ft  open  book.
Tackling the smooth rock  with  all  the  fervor  of  a  possibly  condemned
person, I launched myself upward, grabbed a thank god hold at  the  top  and
hauled myself over the edge.  What greeted me was  the  sweet  sight  of  an
easy romp on snow-covered talus the last 500 feet to the summit.  I  was  on
the S ridge! Even in my relief and joy at success, I  chastised  myself  for
being so extended.  Yes, the route did go.  But it could just  as  well  not
have and where would that have left me? It was really a  dumb  thing  to  do
and I vowed to be more prudent in the future.

I was on the summit of Monument at 1:40 (3100 ft, 5:40).  This  had  another
BoeAlps register placed 9/19/94. Entries  were  by  Grant  Meyers  (7/2/95),
Paul Klenke (8/24/01), Don Beavon (8/9/03) and two others for 2004.  I  must
make special mention of Mitch Blanton\'s 8/22/95 climb.   This  was  part  of
his marathon where he approached from Slate Pass on 8/20,  climbed  Osceola,
Carru, Lago, Blackcap and Lake  on  8/21  (noticed  during  my  climbs  last
week), and Monument on 8/22 continuing out the same day via  S  Fork  Eureka
Cr. He stated he was getting old and wanted to do a marathon  while  he  was
still able! I should say!

The weather had continued to clear sufficiently that I had decent views  and
could see north to Rolo, Osceola, Carru, Lago, and Blackcap, all  the  peaks
I had climbed last week, and Lost, yet to do.  They  were  all  coated  with
fresh snow on their upper levels. Robinson, to the  south,  never  did  shed
its mantle of fog. At 2:00 I started down intending to follow  the  S  ridge
and what I thought would be easy terrain.  I had had enough  challenges  for
the day. But the S ridge didn\'t turn out to the piece of  cake  anticipated.
I guess I didn\'t follow it far enough. I exited it  as  soon  as  it  seemed
reasonable, at about 7000 ft, but got hung up in a series of  broken  cliffs
that led to one dead end after another. Up and down  I  went  casting  about
for a way down.  At one point  I  was  within  30  feet  of  the  talus  but
couldn\'t get down that last bit.  Again I regretted not having a  rope.   To
make matters worse the weather was deteriorating once again and it began  to
rain.

I finally made it down, crossed the lower basin at 6200 ft,  and  began  the
climb back up a series of ribs and gullies to the 7400 ft  notch  in  the  S
ridge of Lake directly above Lake of the Woods. The rain had now  turned  to
wet snow. I reached my tent at 6:40 (8 miles, 4600 ft, 10:40 hr) rather  wet
and bedraggled. Having learned my lesson from last week, on this trip I  was
wearing my Gore-Tex boots so at least I wasn\'t sloshing in soggy socks.  All
thoughts of having a pleasant dinner outside enjoying the view of  the  lake
vanished as I retreated to the shelter of my tent. It snowed  most  of  that
night.

It was still snowing in the morning when I packed up and left  at  8:40  and
several more inches had accumulated on the ground. By  the  time  I  reached
the main Lost-Eureka divide at 11:00 clearing was occurring  again.  Partial
views toward my peaks revealed a fresh coating of snow, now a little  whiter
and a little lower than before. At this rate these high peaks will  soon  be
inaccessible. I was witnessing the coming of winter and I am not  yet  ready
for it. I reached the bridge over Eureka Cr at 1:40, where I stopped  for  a
long rest, and the car at 3:40 (12 miles, 1400 ft, 7 hrs).

Grand total: 32 miles and 11, 500 ft.

Luahna Peak (8400+ feet) and Chalangin Peak (8360+ feet) - September 23-25,
2004


These are the unofficial names of the two peaks on the ridge between Clark
and Tenpeak Mountains in the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area.

I got a late start and traffic  was  terrible  getting  out  of  town  on  a
Thursday morning heading up I-405. Then I was stopped twice  near  the  town
of Skykomish where they are doing work to stabilize cliffs above Highway  2.
I also made a stop at the Lake Wenatchee RS to pick up a  Golden  Age  Pass.
I had just passed my  62nd  birthday,  which  makes  me  eligible  for  this
lifetime pass to federal fee areas (including Forest  Service  and  National
Park). Age does have its privileges. So it was noon by the  time  I  started
up the White River trail. But it was less than 10 miles to where  I  planned
to camp in the basin below Luahna Pk and I felt I had plenty of time to  get
there.

The High Hunt was still in effect,  and  the  trail  showed  signs  of  much
recent horse travel, but all of it turned off  onto  the  trail  to  Boulder
Pass, 4.1 miles in. Beyond here, where I stopped to have  lunch,  there  was
very little sign of any traffic of any kind and I saw no one. From here  the
trail leaves the woods and enters a series of meadows where it is  overgrown
with brush.  On this warm and sunny day (finally  some  good  weather),  the
brush was no problem, but if  wet  would  be  unpleasant  (as  I  found  out
later). At 6.4 miles I crossed Thunder Cr. The crossing is  washed  out  and
the bridge on a tilt but still usable and presented no great problem.

About .7 mile farther (20 minutes), on  a  straight  level  section  of  the
trail at 2800 ft, I began  looking  for  the  old  sheep  drive  trail  into
Thunder Basin.  There was supposed to be a tree marked with an arrow at  the
spot but I never found anything.  I gave up and  just  headed  uphill  at  a
likely spot and hoped for the best.  Sure enough, after a short while I  ran
into the trail.  I was surprised at  how  good  this  trail  is  and  easily
followed it up to 3650 ft where I found another more obscure  trail  leading
right toward Thunder Cr. It first went down  slightly  into  woods,  skirted
the top of a meadow and entered alder brush. From the  meadow  I  could  see
across the valley to the waterfall creek draining the basin below Luahna.  I
was led to believe that the route to the basin goes up  the  right  side  of
this creek. But the alder at this point was awful and getting to  the  creek
would be trying. The trail continued upstream so I  decided  to  follow  it.
Where it entered woods again, it was very near Thunder Cr and a faint  trail
led directly to it at a reasonable crossing via an alder  branch  and  rocks
at 3800 ft. On the other side I found myself in a large meadow on  the  left
side of the waterfall creek with no easy way to get to the right side.

Deciding I was stuck, I headed uphill to the left  of  the  waterfall  creek
toward a break in the brush. To my surprise, this  route  worked  out  quite
well. The initial brush only lasted a few hundred feet  until  I  broke  out
into a large open slabby rock area. I worked my way up staying close to  the
creek (on the way down I found it was better farther to the  left)  until  I
could enter woods above.  Here  a  series  of  climber?-animal?  trails  led
upward until at about 5100 ft I could traverse rightward on a  fern  covered
hillside with many small downed trees into the large  gorgeous  open  grassy
basin. At 6:30 I found a delightful campsite in the upper part of the  basin
at 5200 ft between two creeks (9.5 miles, 3000 ft, 6:30 hr)
.
I find it difficult to get out of a toasty sleeping bag  when  it  is  still
dark out.  These days it doesn\'t get light much before 7:00, so it was  8:00
before I got going the next morning, not the early start I wanted if  I  was
to do this climb in two days. But it was a gorgeous sunny day.   I  couldn\'t
ask for anything better.

Both Beckey and Washington\'s Highest Mountains leave big gaps in  the  route
description to the actual summit of Luahna. I had  very  little  information
from this point on except that the route was supposed to  be  easy  and  all
above timberline and a gully led to the top. The first problem  was  to  get
out of the basin. It was ringed with cliffs and although the  cliffs  didn\'t
look that steep they were covered with dense brush.  Maybe the book  writers
climbed the peak when all the brush was covered with snow. Some  6  separate
waterfalls cascaded down  the  cliffs.   Counting  from  left  to  right,  I
thought I could see a possible  route  connecting  semi-open  areas  between
waterfalls 3 and 4. That is where I headed, working my way  from  open  area
to open area as best I could, but I actually ran  into  some  of  the  worse
brush of the trip in this section.

Fortunately it was short and I soon popped out into the  meadows  above  the
cirque. From here I wandered up pleasant  terrain  toward  the  snow-covered
talus slopes below the SW escarpment of Luahna. I began  running  into  snow
about 7000 ft. I thought I could see a  gully  leading  through  the  cliffs
near the top of the talus slope but as I got closer it looked  wet  and  not
all that inviting. However, slightly below, a broad ramp led  right  through
the cliffs and up onto a gentle  snow-covered  slope  at  7900  ft.  From  I
worked my way farther right on snowy ledges to the S ridge at 8200  ft  just
above a small pinnacle. I then followed the crest of the  exposed  ridge  to
the summit at 11:15 (3200 ft, 3:15 hr).

The register was placed by Mike Torok 9/5/93 (I do believe Mike  has  placed
90% of the registers in the Cascades!). Don Goodman\'s film can  register  of
8/28/93 was transcribed. Other entries: Grant Myers 8/29/94,  Mitch  Blanton
(on to Chalangin and Tenpeak) 9/20/98,  Jim  Brisbine  and  Laura  Zimmerman
9/23/00, Don Beavon (I remember reading his account where one member of  his
party slipped on snow and self-arrested at the last moment  before  "certain
death") 11/30/02, Paul Klenke 8/20/03. There were two parties for 2004.

I took in the absolutely  stunning  view  of  Glacier  Peak  all  white  and
pristine under a fresh coat of white, and Clark  and  all  the  other  peaks
near and far. But  mostly  I  had  eyes  for  Chalangin.  It  looked  rather
fearsome from this vantage, harder than I expected.  But I thought  I  could
pick out a possible  route.  After  30  minutes  on  top,  I  started  down,
retracing my steps.  At the base  of  the  ramp,  at  7700  ft,  I  began  a
traverse toward Chalangin. I climbed to the saddle  between  the  two  peaks
but soon decided I  couldn\'t  follow  the  ridge.  I  continued  on  a  high
traverse on the left (S) side, up and down across gullies and  ribs  passing
three pinnacles. The traverse went on longer than  expected.  Naturally  the
summit was at the far end of the ridge. And for  all  the  rocky  terrain  I
worked my way past, the summit itself ended up being a  nondescript  rounded
bump, somewhat of an anticlimax, which I reached  at  1:45  (4000  ft,  5:45
hr). There was a cairn but no register so I left one.  15  minutes  later  I
started down.  I dearly wanted to find a direct  route  straight  down  from
the summit to the talus, but I couldn\'t take that chance with  no  knowledge
and no view from afar to confirm it possible.  So I retraced  the  traverse.
I was back to the talus in an hour. I missed the route I had  taken  up  the
cirque and ended up going down between waterfalls 4 and 5.  It  worked  out,
despite dense brush near the bottom.

I was now way behind schedule to go all the way out today. I  figured  if  I
got to camp by 3:00, 4:00 at the absolute latest, I could still make  it  to
the White River trail by dark.  I got back to camp at 4:15  (5  miles,  4100
ft, 8:15 hr), so I decided to stay another night.  No one  was  waiting  for
me at home except my kitty.   He  would  survive.  So  I  spent  a  glorious
afternoon basking in the sun reading, sketching and just  relaxing.  A  nice
change from always being on the go.

I was on my way the next morning at 7:15.  It is a little easier to  get  up
early when you have gone to bed the night  before  at  7:00.   There  was  a
heavy dew this morning and I had to pack up a wet tent.  I  had  no  trouble
getting down to the crossing of Thunder Creek, even finding  an  easier  way
down the slabby rock. I still ran into dense brush near the  bottom  but  it
was short.  I crossed Thunder creek at exactly the same place.   I  followed
the old sheep drive all the way to the White River trail,  which  I  reached
at 9:00. It was very good all the way except for the last  hundred  feet  or
so where it was obscured by several large logs. The junction is marked by  a
leaning cut stump and a gray blaze on a large tree.

I hiked the remaining 7.1 miles without a rest arriving at the TH  at  11:50
(9.5 miles, 300 ft, 4:35 hr). The dew was  especially  heavy  in  the  river
valley and the wet brush between Thunder and Boulder Cr  saturated  my  feet
and legs. I once again squished in soggy socks all the way out.   Even  when
the weather is good I still manage to get wet!

Grand Total: 24 miles and 7400 feet

Ptarmigan Peak (8614 feet) and Lost Peak (8464 feet) - September 28-30,
2004


With an extended stretch of good weather in the forecast, I could  have  set
my sights on any number  of  technically  challenging  summits,  but  I  had
unfinished business in the Pasayten. Ptarmigan Peak and Lost Peak  were  the
last two Top 100 I needed to climb in that area.  Both  are  easy  scrambles
but in remote territory and hard to get  to.   The  challenge  would  be  in
combining them in one, hopefully three day, trip.  I came up with a plan  to
do just that, but it involved a  carry  over  Ptarmigan,  cross  country  to
Butte Pass, a dash up Lost, and out over Shellrock Pass.   To  this  end,  I
went as light as possible - an 8 oz bivy sack, a 1 lb sleeping bag, an 8  oz
siltarp just in case the weather report was wrong, and just enough  clothing
to get by.  No book, no sketchpad.  I wouldn\'t have time to read or  sketch.
 Every waking moment I would be on the go.  The plan was to hike as  far  as
possible each day and just bed down  whenever  I  ran  out  of  daylight  or
energy. I didn\'t weigh my pack but it must have been around 20 pounds.

I wanted to do this trip in three days, that was part of the challenge,  but
I was prepared to take four if necessary.  When  I  started  adding  up  the
mileages and elevation gains, I began having serious doubts. (As  an  aside,
the  mileage  listed  for  Ptarmigan  in  75  Scrambles  is  in  error   and
inconsistent. Some 3-5 miles each way must be added to the  total  depending
upon whether you believe  the  text  or  the  summary.  It  is  20.1  miles,
according to GT maps, to the saddle between Tatoosh Buttes, not 14.9  or  17
as stated.)  Success would hinge on two main factors - how far I  could  get
the first day and how difficult the cross-country section between  Ptarmigan
and Butte Pass would be. I had to get to Tatoosh Buttes the first day  if  I
had any chance at all.

I was out the door at 5:30 am. I am not, nor  have  ever  been,  a  painless
early riser so this was very good for me. That put me on the Buckskin  trail
from Slate Pass at 10:45. The day was  warm  and  sunny  and  I  started  in
shorts. Since my last visit here 3 weeks ago, the larches had  turned  color
and  I  began  my  descent  to  the  Middle  Fork  Pasayten  trail   through
spectacular golden groves. I  love  autumn  (when  the  weather  is  good!).
There are no bugs, few people (I saw no one this whole trip. There  was  not
even another car at the TH.), pleasant temperatures and gorgeous scenery.

The descending trail made for rapid progress,  with  one  caveat.  The  High
Hunt had ended the previous weekend, and the heavy horse traffic  that  this
generated, plus the recent rains, had turned sections  of  the  trail  to  a
lumpy, muddy mess that sucked up mere boots. On and on  I  hiked  for  miles
down the Middle Fork, past the Robinson Pass trail (4 miles) and  the  trail
to Shellrock Pass (9.1 miles, where I had a quick  lunch)  until  I  thought
for sure I was going to end up in Canada. River trails always  seem  endless
to me. At last I came to the marked trail to Tatoosh Buttes  at  4:35  (14.1
miles, 680 ft, 5:50 hr). One mile farther I crossed Lease Cr and  filled  up
on water. I wasn\'t sure I would find water any  higher.  It  was  now  after
5:00 and I still had 5 miles and over 2500 feet of elevation gain to get  to
the Buttes.  I was running out of time.

The trail suddenly tilted straight up and climbed very  steeply  through  an
old burn for several miles.  I caught glimpses of Tatoosh  Buttes,  Tamarack
Ridge and Ptarmigan Peak. They all still seemed very far away.  Just  before
7:00, at 6400 ft on the crest of a spur ridge, I  put  on  warmer  clothing,
took off my sunglasses, got out my headlamp and prepared to continue  hiking
as long as possible. In fading light, I hiked on into  more  and  more  open
country.  And then a most wonderful thing occurred. The full  moon  appeared
and turned the meadows to magic. I didn\'t even need a headlamp.  I  followed
the trail all the way to Tatoosh Buttes, even climbing  the  higher  of  the
two (7245 ft), and continued cross-country to  the  next  saddle  along  the
ridge where I found a wonderful grassy flat spot to lay my sleeping  bag  at
8:35 (21 miles, 3800 ft, 9:50 hr). I ate dinner by moonlight  on  this  most
magical and unforgettable of nights. I  was  pleased  to  have  gotten  even
farther than I had hoped.

I awoke the next morning to enchanting  surroundings.  Ptarmigan  may  be  a
walkup (a horse trail can be followed most of  the  way)  but  it  is  worth
every effort to get  to.   Extensive  friendly  meadows,  miles  of  rolling
ridges, and golden larch groves as far as the eye  could  see,  all  with  a
back drop of the rugged north cliffs of Osceola,  Carru  and  Lago  made  me
think I was in heaven.  Some  day,  when  climbing  peaks  no  longer  seems
important, I will return to this area just to wander and enjoy.

I began by meandering below Tamarack Ridge  toward  the  broad  saddle  with
Ptarmigan.  On the way I came across a trickle of water,  the  first  I  had
found since Lease Cr, and was able to augment  my  dwindling  supply.  In  a
reprieve from winter weather, most of the  recent  snows  had  melted,  with
only an odd patch left here and there. Climbing over Point 7748 and  up  the
easy ridge, I reached the summit of Ptarmigan at 9:50 (1650 ft,  2  hr).   I
left a register, as there was none.  I could see over to Butte  Pass  ridge.
It looked very inviting but a long ways away. I continued on the easy  ridge
descending to the saddle with Dot Mountain (8220 ft) and climbing that  peak
before descending steep loose scree to lovely Dot Lake for  lunch  and  much
needed water at noon.

From the lake I contoured at about 6900  ft  through  surprisingly  friendly
terrain to hit the ridge above Ptarmigan Cr just  SW  of  Pt  6946.  So  far
things were going very well. A steep narrow gully led off the ridge  to  the
creek basin below where I hoped to pick up the trail to Butte Pass.  But  in
the basin I ran into a tangle of  brush  and  downed  trees  and  floundered
around for an hour and a half trying to find the trail.  I  could  feel  the
time slipping away and had almost resigned myself to needing  an  extra  day
when, at 2:30 I stumbled across the trail.  I  was  back  in  business.  The
trail, though unmaintained and with numerous logs  across  it,  was  a  vast
improvement over what I had been going through and I easily followed it  for
another half hour to where it begins a traverse west to Butte Pass.  Here  I
left the trail and contoured around Pt 7275 to the saddle to the east  where
I found a pleasant bivy spot (10 miles, 3400 ft,  7:30  hr).  There  was  no
water but I had filled up at Ptarmigan Cr earlier.

Leaving behind all bivy gear, I started for Lost Pk with  a  lightened  pack
at 3:30 figuring I would be cutting it close to  get  back  before  dark.  I
followed the ridge toward Pass Butte,  then  contoured  below  it  around  a
corner and across talus past a saddle to the NW ridge of Lost Pk, which  was
then followed to the summit at 5:30 (1600 ft, 2 hr from bivy site).  I  left
a register in the cairn right next to the survey marker.  A  cold  wind  was
now blowing at about 30 mph and higher gusts threatened to blow me  off  the
ridge crest on the way down. This time I climbed over Pass Butte (8140  ft),
which I think was faster than contouring around it. I  arrived  back  at  my
camp at 7:15 in fading light (15 miles, 5400 ft, 11:20 hr for the day).

I spent a chilly windy night and kept thinking it was light  enough  to  get
up only to realize the brightness was the moon. I finally  awakened  in  the
morning after dreaming I had slept  till  1:00  pm.   It  was  7:00  am,  28
degrees and my sleeping bag was covered with ice crystals. I began  the  day
wearing all the clothing I  had  brought.   I  returned  to  the  trail  and
followed it to Butte Pass, descended down the other side  to  intersect  the
trail to Shellrock Pass and ascended  to  the  pass  through  more  gorgeous
meadows at 10:00. Gradually during the ascent I began  shedding  clothes  as
both I and the day warmed up. From the pass I could see most of the peaks  I
had climbed in the past few weeks, Rolo,  Osceola,  Carru,  Lago,  Blackcap,
Lake, Monument, Ptarmigan and Lost. They all felt like old friends now,  and
yet I felt a moment of regret at having climbed them all with none  left  to
do.  Then I cheered up thinking of all the lower peaks I could  still  climb
that would give me an excuse to come back to this lovely area (Do  I  really
need an "excuse" to come back?).

On the other side of the pass I was  soon  on  familiar  territory  from  my
previous trip. It was now just a matter of putting in the required  time  to
hike the long distance out. I reached Freds  Pass  at  12:45,  the  Paysaten
River trail at 2:00, Robinson Pass trail at 4:10 and  the  TH  at  6:20  (20
miles, 4800 ft, 10:30 hr).

Greenwood Mountain (8415 feet) - October 9-10, 2004


Locked into a weekend (I  am  usual  out  during  the  week)  with  an  iffy
forecast by family commitments, I arrived at the Phelps Creek  TH  at  11:30
to light sprinkles and fresh snow on  the  higher  mountains.  The  previous
several days had been heavy rain. Five cars were parked in the  lot.  I  met
four of the five parties who belonged to said vehicles coming out as I  made
my way up the trail. Two were  coming  out  early,  chased  away  from  more
ambitious plans by the bad weather. One fellow had already spent two  nights
in Spider Meadow with pouring rain. He had had enough.  Another  couple  was
retreating from Leroy Basin where the original intention had been  to  climb
Maude and Seven Fingered Jack. Camped higher, they had been  snowed  on  the
previous night. Being fellow climbers, I stopped to  chat  with  them.  When
asked what I was climbing I told them  Greenwood.  They  were  not  familiar
with it, so I identified  it  as  the  peak  behind  Dumbbell.  They  seemed
intrigued and said they would have to check it out on a  map.  Then,  seeing
that I was alone, the woman asked very seriously in a stern  tone  of  voice
if I had told anyone where I was  going.  She  came  on  so  strong  that  I
replied, "What are you, my Mother?"  She answered, "Yes."  I really took  no
offense at this. I just thought it was funny a complete  stranger  would  be
so concerned and take it upon herself to chastise me. As a matter  of  fact,
my family knew exactly where I was and what I was doing this time, but I  do
admit that for some simpler outings I don\'t always  bother  telling  someone
personally (although I always leave a note at  home).  So  she  did  have  a
point. A person alone should always let someone know where they  are  going.
This led to a discussion of the fellow  who  had  recently  been  lost  near
Colchuck Lake and could not be found because no one knew where he  was.  And
then to the couple querying themselves if they  had  informed  anyone  where
they were going. Just because there were two of them didn\'t mean  they  were
immune to mishap. We parted friends and  I  continued  up  the  trail  still
chuckling to myself.

I set up camp on a flat grassy  site  just  inside  Phelps  Basin  at  3:30,
elevation 5400 feet (7 miles, 1900 ft, 3:15 hr).  I  crawled  into  my  tent
just in time as the light sprinkles turned to heavier showers, ate an  early
dinner and went to sleep at 7:00.  It rained most of the night, which  meant
it snowed at higher elevations.

I started next morning at 7:30.  It had quit raining  and  begun  to  clear.
The route to Greenwood has been described several times  recently  in  other
trip reports so I won\'t repeat it.  I began to run  into  fresh  snow  about
6000 feet and by the time I got to the talus basin below Dumbbell there  was
several inches of the wet treacherous white stuff  covering  the  rocks.  My
biggest fear, of course, was if I would be able to traverse the  goat  ledge
with fresh snow on it. At the notch I made a slight error in route  finding.
I was under the (mistaken) impression that I had to  descend  the  gully  on
the other side a short ways to access the ledge. In  retrospect,  I  believe
that the ledge everyone talks about  starts  from  the  same  level  as  the
notch, and in fact I found this ledge on the way back.  My  error  may  have
been a fortunate one though, as this ledge looked  challenging  and  exposed
in the snow. In any event I descended the gully about 30 feet or  so,  which
was wet and slippery and required a rope (which I  left  in  place  for  the
return) to get down, to a  wider,  probably  easier  ledge  below  that  led
across the face to the snowfield. Only the first part of this ledge gave  me
pause, as it was exposed and snowy. The  snowfield  itself  had  fresh  snow
over ice.  I had crampons along just for this section, but didn\'t use  them.
 For the most part the fresh snow gave good footing, although I did  slip  a
few times on the harder stuff underneath. Once on the SW ridge it  was  easy
going to the summit at 11:30 (3300 ft, 4 hr).

I had a devil of a time finding the  register  in  the  fresh  snow  on  the
summit.  I was beginning to think  I  wasn\'t  on  the  right  bump,  when  I
finally excavated it from a hole slightly  off  to  the  side  of  the  high
point. I signed in after Paul Cho of 9/6/04. Per his suggestion, I  added  a
new Ziploc bag.  I am amazed that the register has weathered so  many  years
so well.  The weather continued to clear and I was beginning to  get  views.
I could see to the N peak. I am aware there is some  question  as  to  which
peak is higher.  To settle this I had carried a  small  sighting  clinometer
up with me. This is a quality surveying  instrument  that  will  tell  if  a
distant point is higher or lower than the one sighted  from.  It  will  only
tell if it is higher or lower.  It will not tell by how  much.  I  was  very
careful to sight at the level of the summit  to  the  N  peak.  I  did  this
several times.  By my reckoning, the summit I  was  on,  the  one  with  the
register, is definitely higher, by about 1 degree. Case closed as far  as  I
am concerned.  I was very glad as I didn\'t want  to  have  to  climb  the  N
peak.

There was even more clearing and more views during the return trip.  It  was
turning out to be a lovely day. Reluctant to end the day, from the  notch  I
continued S along the ridge thinking I could follow it all  the  way  to  Pt
8039, but I was stopped by cliffs above a saddle at a  high  point  of  7960
ft. I arrived back in camp at 3:00 with enough time for  tea  and  a  sketch
before leaving an hour  later.  The  trip  out  through  Spider  Meadow  was
delightful with the fall colors and I had it all to myself.  I  reached  the
TH at 6:15, the only car left.

Total: 20 miles and 5750 feet

      Hoodoo Pk and Raven Ridge (USGS Hoodoo Pk) - So impressed  was  I
      with the Chelan-Sawtooth area that I returned a short time  later
      for two more peaks.  This time entry was via the Libby Lake Tr. I
      hiked this 6 mile trail, the last bit  through  very  interesting
      rocky terrain, in a little over  3  hours  gaining  3300  ft  and
      arrived at the lake at  2:20.  I  found  a  nice  sandy  campsite
      nestled among picturesque rocks and larches on a knoll above  the
      lake. The larches themselves weren\'t quite  as  beautiful  as  my
      earlier trip, as they were beginning to shed their  needles,  but
      now the ground was covered with a golden carpet.  In  setting  up
      my camp I discovered I had forgotten  my  camp  waterbottle.   To
      improvise I used doubled small garbage bags  to  carry  water  up
      from the lake.


      I left to climb Hoodoo Pk at 3:00. The route was pretty  straight
      forward, over the E ridge of Pt 8071 into the basin S  of  Hoodoo
      then onto the S ridge. The  only  miscalculation  was  traversing
      too high on the N side of the E ridge over steep rock and  talus.
      It would have been easier and faster to drop all the way  to  the
      basin below.  This is the way I returned.  Also, this being the N
      side it never got any sun to melt the previous night\'s coating of
      clear frost.  I discovered this  the  hard  way  after  taking  a
      couple of unexpected slips on the ice.


      I reached the summit at 4:30 and signed the register left by  the
      Boealps on 9/10/94.  Mike Torok was also  there  on  10/8/94  and
      expressed disappointment that the Boealps had beat him to placing
      a register, or maybe he was just unhappy he had to carry a  heavy
      Mountaineer register out again. I was back in camp by 6:00  (1200
      ft and 3 hrs RT) and having a pleasant dinner outside when  light
      snow began to fall and forced me prematurely into my tent.


      I awoke at 7:00 the next morning to everything frozen  solid  and
      covered by a thin coating of snow.  My  garbage  bag  waterbottle
      was a frozen puddle.  It was now I  also  discovered  that,  this
      time of year, I doubt the Libby Lake basin  ever  sees  the  sun,
      surrounded as it is by cliffs on most every side. This put a  bit
      of a kink in my plan to zip up to Raven  Ridge.   All  the  rocks
      were coated with snow and ice and  very  slippery  and  warranted
      very careful foot placements, which  of  course  slowed  me  down
      considerably.


      I worked my way around the S side of the lake, then up the  first
      likely looking gully. As the gully  steepened  near  the  top,  I
      exited left onto a ramp then worked back right to  easier  slopes
      above the gully and to the ridge crest about  Â¼  mile  E  of  the
      summit, where I entered most welcomed sunshine. Here the sun  had
      melted the ice. Huge talus along the ridge made  for  interesting
      scrambling at first.  This then eased  to  smaller  stuff  and  I
      arrived at the high point at 10:00 (1070 ft and 2:00 hrs).


      There was no summit register, which surprised me as this  is  one
      of the Bulgar List 100 Highest (also called Libby Pk). So I  left
      a small one. I was not that pleased  with  my  ascent  route  and
      looked for a direct way down to the lake but  could  see  nothing
      appealing.  So I retraced my steps back along the ridge.  When  I
      was back at my arrival point I decided to continue  E  along  the
      ridge to Corax Pk (8572) as the way looked pretty good. There was
      a little large talus to get through but it  was  not  bad  and  I
      arrived at the interesting highest pinnacle with a  cool  shelter
      rock cave and big blocks at 11:15.


      Again I looked for a direct route down  to  the  lake  and  found
      none.  My ascent route seemed to be the best way, as least  given
      the conditions.  So back again along  the  ridge  to  retrace  my
      steps. The lake was still  in  the  shade  and  the  rocks  still
      slippery by the time I got back down to my tent at 1:00 (1600  ft
      and 5 hrs RT).  I was at the TH by 4:00.  I had not seen  a  soul
      the whole trip. 17 miles and 6400 ft. Fay Pullen, 10/21-22/02.

South Spectacle Butte (8392 feet)


First Attempt and the Mouse Wars - October  21-22,  2004  -  This  trip  was
doomed from the start. First the weather forecast  was  not  good.   Second,
family commitments prevented me from getting an early start on Thursday  and
required me to be back early on Friday.   But  I  needed  the  exercise  and
decided to give it a try anyway.

I started up the Entiat River trail at 1:45 on a mountain bike  under  sunny
skies and pleasant temperatures.  Normally I don\'t like to mountain bike  up
hiking trails.  I am not a very strong biker and usually end up pushing  the
bike more than riding it, so I don\'t consider it worth  the  effort.  But  I
was getting such a late start I would try anything to gain  a  little  time.
By the time I reached the Glacier Peak Wilderness  boundary  at  3:10,  4.5
miles in, I was ready to stash the bike and continue on foot. At 8  miles  I
turned onto the Ice Creek trail. I made  camp  at  a  well-established  bare
site in the woods just before the trail crossed  Ice  Creek  for  the  first
time at 6:15, elevation 4800 ft (11 miles, 2000 ft, 4.5 hr).

I was awakened at 1:00 am by a mouse scurrying over my tent. It  was  zipped
up tight so I assumed the mouse was outside the  tent.  I  shook  the  walls
hoping to scare it away. This went on for half an  hour  until  I  felt  the
mouse run over  my  head.  That  meant  it  was  inside  the  tent  and  the
implications of that were too terrible to contemplate.  On came  the  light.
Searching my tent yielded no mouse, but I did find the feared hole that  had
been chewed through the foot of the tent wall. This was war!  Off  went  the
light. Play possum. Back came the mouse. On with the light and I saw a  tail
disappear into my pack. Several minutes more of off and on light and  I  saw
the mouse in the open and was able to catch him with  my  hand.  Success!  I
felt like a mighty hunter until I looked at the terrified  little  creature.
Good heavens, what do I do now?   If  I  just  toss  him  outside,  he  will
probably come back in again. Maybe I could wring his neck, but he  was  soft
and squishy I doubted it. Maybe I could chop off his head, but  that  seemed
overly gruesome and  messy  with  my  small  pocketknife.  Meanwhile,  as  I
contemplated all these various solutions, I continued to hold  tightly  onto
the little guy so he wouldn\'t get away.  I  guess  I  was  squeezing  pretty
hard, because he wasn\'t looking too good. Maybe I suffocated him or he  just
died of fright. In any event, I  threw  him  out  the  tent  door.   In  the
morning he was still there, very dead. I felt bad, but not too  bad.   After
all he had chewed a hole in my good tent.

I was awakened at 3:30 by another mouse running over my  head.   Not  again!
Was I ever going to get any sleep? However, this mouse had  the  good  sense
to be scared off by my thrashing and crashing. He didn\'t want  to  meet  the
same fate at mouse #1. This is one reason I don\'t like to camp at well  used
sites. The critters are too habituated to finding  food  in  tents  and  are
very bold in their pursuit of it. I usually camp in remote, off  the  beaten
path places and rarely have such problems.

I finally fell asleep fully expecting more  mouse  encounters,  but  when  I
awoke it was already 7:00.  Not the early start I had wanted. But it  really
didn\'t matter. It had snowed all night long and was  still  snowing  lightly
and was windy, so making my summit was pretty much out of the  question.   I
even considered just packing up and heading straight out, but I needed  more
of a workout.  2000 feet of elevation was hardly enough  to  get  the  blood
circulating. So I headed up the trail at 8:00. Once I  got  moving,  it  was
really very pleasant. The meadows  were  lovely  all  covered  with  several
inches of fresh snow.  I  was  able  to  follow  the  trail  past  two  more
crossings of Ice Creek (I made note of a good  campsite  between  these  two
crossing) before leaving it at 5400 ft to head up the gully leading  to  the
saddle between N and S Spectacle Buttes. I soon exited the gully right  onto
a wooded rib that I followed in ever increasing  snow  depth  to  the  basin
below S Spectacle\'s W face where I began  wallowing  in  knee-deep  snow.  I
exhausted myself continuing up  the  treacherous  hole  filled  snow-covered
talus. Reason prevailed when I reached the SW ridge at 7000 ft  in  blizzard
conditions and turned around. It was 10:30. At least I had my workout.

Total - 27 miles and 4800 feet

Second Attempt and Success  -  October  27-28,  2004  -  I  hate  unfinished
business. My family commitments were over on Tuesday. So on Wednesday,  with
a forecast of two days of good weather, I was back  at  the  Entiat  TH  for
another try. This time I was able to get an  earlier  start.  I  reached  my
intended  campsite,  about  a  mile  farther  than  last  week\'s,  at  4:15,
elevation 5250 ft (12 miles, 2500 ft, 5 hr). In the intervening week it  had
snowed more, but I found a bare spot under a tree to  pitch  my  tent.   The
promised good weather had materialized and it was a beautiful sunny day.  At
5:00 I started up the trail to Ice Lakes  and  reached  the  lower  lake  at
6:15. I had a great view of my route up S Spectacle and along the SW  ridge.
 It looked rather frightful with  snow  covering  the  rock.   I  could  see
several pinnacles along the ridge that could give  some  problems.   I  also
had Jim Brisbine\'s recent report where he reported difficulty  getting  past
one of them.  It was probably rather optimistic  of  me  to  think  I  could
climb this peak under these conditions. But I was going to give it one  last
try before giving up for this year.

I was back to my tent at 7:30 (2 miles, 1600 ft,  2.5  hr).  This  was  the
night of the full moon and the lunar  eclipse.   I  had  a  front  row  seat
viewing it from my tent door as  I  ate  dinner.  It  was  rather  a  spooky
reddish subdued light. I turned in at 8:30 and almost immediately was  again
annoyed by a mouse running over my tent.  I  had  patched  the  hole  chewed
last week.  I had visions of having to patch another one. But after  several
violent shakings of the tent wall the mouse left me alone. I  slept  soundly
through the night.  But the next morning I found a hole chewed  in  my  food
bag that had been hung from a tree branch.  What is it with these Ice  Creek
mice? They must be super mice with radar for  noses  that  can  detect  food
anywhere. I had a mental image of a mouse hanging by his tail while  chewing
a hole in the bottom of the bag.

I started at 7:00 by headlamp on this cold crisp  morning.  By  the  time  I
turned off the trail the headlamp was  no  longer  needed.   I  followed  my
route of last week to the basin, where I again wallowed in  knee-deep  snow,
and onto the SW ridge. The snow was even deeper now and  progress  was  slow
up steep slopes and around a first rocky point. Here I crossed to the  sunny
side of the ridge and the snow depth diminished, even being melted  down  to
bare rock in places.  At  9:30  I  reached  the  base  of  the  first  major
pinnacle at 7500 ft. I believe this was the  pinnacle  that  caused  Jim  so
much trouble getting around.  He took the assault high, almost to  the  top.
I knew I didn\'t want to go the way he did.   It  sounded  bad  enough  under
good conditions. I decided to stay low. I could see a ramp that led  to  the
right at the base of the pinnacle toward  the  major  gully  on  that  side.
Perhaps I could get into the gully from there. To my surprise the  ramp  led
around the corner to a wide ledge that traversed the  length  of  the  south
side of the pinnacle all the way to the top of the  gully.   The  exit  from
the ledge to gully was a tad tricky but nothing that made  me  too  nervous.
Several hundred feet  of  step  kicking  up  variable  snow,  from  hard  to
breakable crust to knee-deep powder,  led  to  a  second  smaller  pinnacle.
After crossing a notch, another south side ledge traverse that looked  worse
than it turned  out  to  be,  gave  way  to  easier  terrain  before  I  was
confronted with the final few hundred feet of the summit pyramid. This  took
an hour or so to surmount as I carefully worked my way up snowy  ledges  and
broken rock. I topped out at 11:30 (3150 ft, 4:30 hr). I signed in on  Jim\'s
newly placed register. I had gorgeous views of Maude, Seven  Fingered  Jack,
Fernow, both Ice Lakes and the whole of the Entiat area.

 I was elated that I had been able to climb my  peak.   But  congratulations
were not yet in order. The climb was only half over.  I still  had  get  off
the thing. Getting down the summit pyramid was tricky  and  slow  going.   I
had trouble reversing a couple of moves and had a few  nervous  moments.   I
did have a rope and slings with me, but I never used them. I was glad I  had
my tracks in the snow to follow down.  The route was  not  at  all  obvious.
At 1:20 I was at the base of the ridge. Once on continuous snow things  went
faster and I was back to camp at 2:00. I left at 2:45 and reached the  TH  a
little before 7:00, in the dark.  Now  I  could  congratulate  myself  on  a
successful climb and the end of a  successful  season  climbing  25  of  the
Highest Hundred.

Total - 30 miles and 7700 feet

      Fortune Mountain (5903 feet) - November 4-5, 2004



      This time of year you have to be flexible.  My original  plan  was  to
      climb Mac Peak and Swallowtail from Deception Lakes  using  the  Tonga
      Ridge road as a shortcut to the trail. But I started running into deep
      snow at about 3200 ft, well before the highpoint of the road and  knew
      I would never be able to get to the TH.  On to Plan  B.  This  was  to
      climb Fortune Mountain from the Meadow Cr  trail  and  Fortune  Ponds,
      where access started from the lower (2000 ft) Rapid River road.


      The first mile of the trail was snow-free to 3000 ft.  Then  I  turned
      the corner from the sunny south-facing slope into the Meadow Cr valley
      and immediately ran into snow. I was able to follow the trail, despite
      increasing snow depth, all the way to a camp at 4800 ft  in  the  flat
      meadow below Fortune Mountain just before the trail descends  slightly
      to the lower pond (6.5 miles, 3100 ft, 4:30 hr). Snow depth  here  was
      about 2 feet. The last mile or so I began breaking  through  the  rain
      crust under several inches of fluffy powder. Snowshoes would have been
      nice, but I had elected not to carry them in and in  fact  they  would
      have been marginally useful.  I only broke through the  crust  on  the
      trail where it had been undercut by running water. Once off trail  the
      crust held my weight and boots alone worked fine.


      I took over an  hour  choosing  and  then  preparing  a  site  for  my
      freestanding tent. I chose a place out in  the  open,  despite  deeper
      snow and more required  shoveling,  rather  than  be  dripped  on  and
      bombarded all night long under trees whose  fresh  load  of  snow  was
      melting in the sun and would turn to ice as  soon  as  it  set.  After
      being treated to a spectacular sunset, I crawled into my tent for  the
      long cold night. During the night I was let  down,  literally,  by  my
      Thermarest as it gradually lost air to become a useless flat  pancake.
      How could this be?  It had been fine when I had  used  it  last  week.
      Then I remembered I had laid it out to dry at home on  the  spare  bed
      where my cat likes to hang out.  Bad kitty!  Cat claws are  sharp  but
      tiny.  I could not find the pinprick leak. (I found it later  at  home
      by immersing it in a tub full of water.)  Thank heavens I had  brought
      a second foam pad or the cold night would have been even colder.


      It was 24 degrees when I woke at  7:00  the  next  morning  and  as  I
      crawled out of my warm sleeping bag, I had to remind myself that I was
      having fun, really I was. Once I got moving I actually  did  start  to
      enjoy myself. The fresh snow was lovely, all sparkly  with  new  frost
      crystals, the step kicking up the steep slope was straight forward and
      invigorating, and the view of Glacier Peak from the summit gorgeous. I
      descended directly to upper Fortune Pond and then to  the  lower  one.
      Both were frozen over, although Peach Lake, which I also saw from  the
      summit, was not. I was back to my tent, now in the sun,  by  10:30  (2
      miles, 1300 ft, 2:30 hr). I spent a very  pleasant  hour  and  a  half
      sitting in the warm sun drinking tea,  reading  and  sketching  before
      heading out at noon. Three hours later I was at the car, with over two
      hours of daylight to spare.

Atrium (5359 feet) and St. Agnes Ridge (5547 feet) - November 10-11, 2004


Even with good weather, backpacking this time of year involves dealing  with
short days, cold temperatures, unpleasant conditions, and many hours in  the
tent to pass the long night, so I was somewhat surprised when  Linda  agreed
to accompany me on this trip. I was very happy to have the company,  not  to
mention help breaking trail.

We were able to stay on the trail all the way to Big Heart Lake. (Stefan,  I
must agree with you that it is at least 8 miles to  here,  not  the  6.8  GT
says.) The  first  snow  was  encountered  shortly  before  the  turnoff  to
Malachite Lake. From Little Heart to Big Heart the snow increased  in  depth
to about 2 feet and was inconsistent, alternating between crust  and  slush,
making trailbreaking slow and exhausting  (Again,  we  had  elected  not  to
bring snowshoes). We arrived at Big  Heart  Lake  a  little  after  4:00  (8
miles, 3540 ft, 6 hrs) with plenty of time to set up camp in  daylight.   We
pitched the tent on snow but had a snow free spot under a tree  to  organize
our kitchen. We ate dinner by headlamp, prolonging it as  long  as  possible
before being driven into the tent by the cold. It  was  a  beautiful,  clear
starlit night.

Twelve hours later, we emerged from our warm  sleeping  bags,  having  slept
soundly most of that time. I guess we were tired. My leaking  Thermarest  of
last week had been successfully repaired and I was well insulated  from  the
ground. Most of the snow had frozen solid overnight, to the point  just  shy
of needing crampons (which we hadn\'t brought anyway). Yet there  were  those
odd places, mostly under the protection of trees, that hadn\'t  frozen  where
we would sink in unexpectedly to our knees and this prevented any  sense  of
security and steady rhythm. Despite  this  we  made  rapid  progress  toward
Atrium, our first destination, still able  to  follow  the  trail  until  it
traversed left at 5000 ft toward the NE ridge and then  continuing  straight
up the N ridge to the top (850 ft, :50 hr).

We basked in the sun and the view of all the snowy  peaks  (most  impressive
was the cold, forbidding north face of Chimney Rock) and alpine lakes  (none
of which were yet frozen) for thirty minutes, before continuing  on  to  St.
Agnes Ridge. We had a pretty  good  view  of  where  we  wanted  to  go.  We
descended NE from the summit of Atrium down hard snow to  the  outlet  creek
of Angeline Lake. Here we found an unexpected mini gorge with  no  easy  way
down the vertical wall. We wandered around  a  bit  searching  for  a  route
until finding a wooded ledge upstream that gave  access  to  the  creek.   A
treacherous crossing on hole filled snow covered large boulders  put  us  on
the NW ridge of St Agnes. Once there it was mostly a trouble free  climb  on
solid snow until reaching a cliff at about 5300 ft. From  the  map  a  route
appeared feasible to the left of the cliff, but  that  would  have  involved
traversing an extensive partially snow-covered talus  basin  that  was  very
unappealing. From our distant view, another route  looked  possible  to  the
right through trees even though the map showed it to be  very  steep.  Steep
it was, but we managed to work our way through short cliffs,  climbing  root
ladders and pulling ourselves up brush and branches to emerge on the  gentle
ridge above. At noon we came upon the summit cairn (1950 ft, 3:45 hr).

Buried in the cairn was the historic glass jar register transcribed  by  Don
and Natala Goodman during their 2002 climb. The  only  other  entry  was  by
Stefan Feller in July of this year.  On  late  season  or  winter  climbs  I
don\'t expect to find registers as they are usually buried under snow,  so  I
was very happy to have found this one.  It was so pleasant  on  the  summit,
we spent almost an hour eating  lunch  and  enjoying  more  sun  and  views,
despite knowing the day was fast diminishing.  We already knew we  would  be
going out in the dark.

We followed our footsteps down. We had found most of the holes  on  way  up,
but a few new ones appeared in the warming day, especially in  those  places
heated by the sun, and care was needed to avoid injury to  lower  limbs.  It
was essential that we cross the Angeline  Lake  outlet  creek  in  the  same
place  and  find  the  ledge  leading  out  of  the  gorge.  Once  that  was
accomplished we worked our way to the NE ridge of Atrium where we  hoped  to
pick up the trail again. But once on the ridge we couldn\'t find  the  trail.
A hairy traverse on the north slope to check things out made me  believe  we
were too low. Sure enough a short climb up from the traverse  we  found  the
trail. It was clear sailing back to camp at 3:00 (4  miles,  2500  ft,  6:40
hr).

We quickly packed up and were ready to go at 3:40.  We  made  it  to  Copper
Lake before needing headlamps at 5:30. The trail seemed to  go  on  forever,
as it always does when you are ready for things to end, before reaching  the
TH at 7:40 (8 miles, 560 ft, 4 hrs). The parking  lot  puddles  had  already
refrozen and the car windows  were  covered  with  ice.  We  celebrated  our
success with a satisfying Mexican dinner in Sultan.

Nimbus Mountain (6711 feet) and Thor Peak (6804 feet) - November 16-17,
2004


I wasn\'t sure what either the weather or I was going  to  do  on  these  two
days. We both ended up exceeding expectations.  I  headed  for  the  Stevens
Pass area hoping to bag another Back Court peak. I first  tried  once  again
(I had tried two weeks ago) to drive up the Tonga Ridge road to get  to  the
short cut to Deception Lakes and Mac Pk. I didn\'t really think I would  make
it but at least this time I got farther.  The road was mostly clear  to  the
high point turnoff to Mt Sawyer, but once on the other  side  of  the  ridge
turned snowy and after sliding out of the icy track several times I  decided
not to risk it any further. It was on to the Surprise Cr TH and  a  try  for
Nimbus.

This trail has had a lot of work done since I was  last  on  it.  Dozens  of
wooden steps and bridges have been added in the  first  mile  to  the  creek
crossing. Very nice on a warm day, but these same wooden improvements  would
cause me grief on the way out. Once past the crossing I began  running  into
snow, but a well-broken track went all the way to Surprise Lake.  I found  a
nice level spot to camp along the creek at the junction to  Trap  Pass  just
before Surprise Lake (4 miles, 2300 ft, 2:40 hr).

It was still early in the afternoon, so I killed a little time by  wandering
over to Surprise Lake.  It was partially frozen. Back at  camp,  just  as  I
started to do a sketch of the lovely snowy creek,  it  started  to  snow.  I
finished it sitting inside my tent peering out the door. It was  still  only
4:00. I made an early dinner and read a while.  Now  it  was  6:00.  Camping
this time of year would be so much more pleasant if only you didn\'t have  to
spend the night. I listened  to  my  newly  acquired  MP3  player.   What  a
marvelous invention. Quality music in a tiny package.  I was  even  able  to
pick up an FM station from Canada. Light rock they called it. Not really  my
cup of tea.  I am more of a classical fan, but I wasn\'t in a position to  be
picky (I had only had time to record 1 hour of my music onto the player).  I
fell asleep listening to it. It snowed all night  long  and  periodically  I
would wake up to shake snow off the tent.

I awoke the next morning to clear blue skies.  What a surprise!   After  the
usual unpleasantries getting the body going, I started up the trail to  Trap
Pass at 7:30 on snowshoes. It had snowed about 4 inches overnight on top  of
a several foot base at the deepest. I easily followed the trail to the  pass
then traversed right of the ridge to where it steepened. At the  top  of  an
open slope on the west side I ran into a short cliffy wooded  section  which
required removal of the snowshoes. Above this  I  began  a  delightful  open
traverse that wandered up and down across broad benches and  around  gullies
on the east side of the pinnacled ridge. I passed beneath Slippery Slab  and
several other equally impressive rock towers.  The way was very  scenic  and
the views expansive in the glorious sunshine. What a day!

I hit the SE ridge of Nimbus at 6600 ft, with a view down to frozen  Thunder
Mtn Lake, and soon after exchanged snowshoes for boots and ice  ax  for  the
final hundred foot climb to the summit (2500 ft, 3:30 hr). I found  a  cairn
(no register so I left one) on a flat boulder between  two  slightly  higher
points. I\'m not sure which was highest. One I was able to climb.  The  other
was a sheer boulder.  The best I  could  do  without  a  rope  or  someone\'s
shoulder to stand on was to touch the top. It would have to do

I now turned my attention to Thor.  I had thought to perhaps include  it  in
the itinerary if I had the time. But it had taken longer to  get  to  Nimbus
than I had hoped and I wasted more time trying to get up the sheer  boulder.
Thor looked very inviting and easy, if I could get to the saddle between  it
and Nimbus.  That would be the key.  From the map the  descent  from  Nimbus
looked to be very cliffy. Conditions and weather were both good.  I  had  to
at least try, although that meant I would be going  out  in  the  dark  once
again. The first obstacle was to get around  the  rocky  point  just  SE  of
Nimbus. A tricky, exposed but short traverse on hard  snow  just  below  the
cliffs on the north side led to easier terrain and back to the crest of  the
ridge. Cliffs were below on both sides but by sticking to the  nose  of  the
ridge I was able  to  work  my  way  down,  several  times  slithering  down
vertical shrubby steps, to the saddle some 400 feet below. From  the  saddle
pleasant slopes led easily to the summit of Thor (3300 ft, 5:40 hr).

I found a cairn and glass jar register on the  rocky  summit.  The  register
dated from 1987 and contained the usual roster of familiar peak baggers:  C.
Hickenbottem, 8/19/91;Grant  Meyers,  9/10/95;  Mitch  Blanton  8/1/98;  Don
Beavon & Mike Torok, 3/6/01; John Roper, 8/8/02; and Steve Fox & John  Tolan
6/16/04. It was so glorious on top, the weather so friendly, warm and  sunny
and no wind, and the views so gorgeous I was reluctant to leave.  I  finally
forced myself to go at 1:30.

I was down to the saddle in 10 minutes. The  climb  up  from  there  went  a
little slower as I had to bodily pull myself up the steps on  branches.  The
tricky traverse was faster and easier with steps already  kicked.   I  found
an easier way off the ridge the final bit  to  Trap  Pass  and  avoided  the
cliffy section in the woods. I was back to camp at 4:00 (6 miles,  3800  ft,
8:30 hrs) and packed up and ready to leave  at  4:25.  The  sunny  warm  day
faded to a distant memory with the fading light as the night  turned  frigid
and the trail turned into  an  icy  treacherous  descent.  Several  times  I
slipped only to catch myself with my poles. I crawled the  log  crossing  of
Surprise Creek rather than surely slip  off  and  tiptoed  down  the  wooden
steps and bridges that glistened with ice and  frost.  The  trail  was  much
more dangerous than anything I had done  on  my  peaks.   I  reached  a  car
coated in ice at 6:45.

Little Bulger Peak (5111 feet) - November 30, 2004


With snow levels low and the passes treacherous driving  I  stayed  west  of
the crest and headed up the Middle Fork Snoqualmie  River  Road.  The  first
part of the road was as potholed as ever but once past the Taylor River  the
road seemed better than I remembered it and I arrived at the Dingford Cr  TH
sooner than expected. A light dusting of snow covered the road.

I followed the trail to Myrtle Lake (5.5 miles,  2500  ft,  3:15  hr)  where
there was about 1 foot of fresh snow. It was foggy with snow showers.   More
of a problem was the occasional bombardment of masses of  snow  falling  off
tree boughs in  the  warming  temperatures.   A  few  were  direct  hits.  I
continued following the trail toward Little Myrtle Lake but  soon  lost  the
way and just headed uphill after crossing the creek between the  two  lakes.
I trended to the right to avoid cliffs and boulder fields then back  to  the
left to hit the ridge north of the summit. The snow was over knee  deep  and
here I could feel old snow under the new. At times I  floundered  in  deeper
holes. I tried snowshoes for a while, but I sank in as deep with them on  as
with them off.  No help at all. The last bit to the top was  slow  going.  I
topped out at 3:10 (3550 ft, 5:25  hr).  Not  much  of  a  view  but  I  was
impressed by the cliffs on the west side of the ridge which I could see.

I was back to the lake in an hour.  40 minutes later it was  headlamp  time,
after which I proceeded to stumble slowly down the slippery rocky trail.  It
snowed lightly most of the way out.

Bentrim Hill (6078 feet)


You can almost drive to the top of this peak in the  summer,  especially  if
you have a 4-wheel drive vehicle, but what is the point  in  that?  My  plan
was to make a real trip of it and bicycle as far as possible from the  south
up Naneum Canyon. I took the Kittitas exit off I-90 and the Naneum  Cr  Road
to a school bus turn-around and a locked gate at the entrance to the  canyon
at 2500 ft.


First Attempt - November 24, 2004. This was  the  day  before  Thanksgiving.
The night before and that day was heavy rain in the west, but  it  was  only
light sprinkles when I started out on my  bike.  However,  enough  rain  had
already fallen to turn much of the road to a muddy  mess.  One  section  was
such sticky gumbo that my wheels and brakes  and  chain  became  so  clogged
with goo that they would barely turn. I really should have  given  up  then,
but I was stubborn (stupid?) and continued to push and half  carry  my  bike
to firmer terra. Then  after  taking  3.75  hours  to  bike  11.6  miles,  I
mistakenly stashed my bike too soon at  the  wrong  junction  (the  area  is
riddled with unmarked roads), came to the end of my chosen  road,  tried  to
continue cross-country and proceeded to get myself  thoroughly  confused  in
dense woods. I ended up on the shoulder of  Pt  5537  (an  interesting  open
scab rock ridge)  still  a  mile  from  Bentrim  with  darkness  falling.  I
considered continuing on using my headlamp and GPS, as  once  on  Bentrim  I
could pick up the proper road and easily follow it back to my bike. But  the
batteries in both my headlamp and GPS were failing (I forgot to change  them
from my last trip and had no spares). If I had any  hope  of  navigating  my
way back to my bike that night I had to  turn  around  immediately.  (I  was
making Thanksgiving dinner for my kids the next day.  It  would  nice  if  I
made it home in time to prepare it).


Fortunately, I had marked the position of my bike with the  GPS,  so  all  I
had to do was follow it back. Unfortunately, my GPS soon went totally  dead.
I was now in the dense woods and confusing rolling terrain of Naneum  Basin.
Oh the hazards of depending on battery operated gadgets. What to do?  I  did
have a low tech, but always functional, compass in my  pack,  but  that  was
only a last resort.  Besides, I only had a vague notion of where  I  was  (I
determined later I was near Pt 5537). If you don\'t know where you  are,  you
don\'t know what course to  follow,  except  in  a  most  general  manner  to
perhaps hit the main road somewhere. My headlamp was a Black  Diamond  Zenix
with two strengths of LEDs and uses the same AAA batteries as my GPS.  Thank
heavens for LEDs.  They use  very  little  battery  power.  I  switched  the
slightly better batteries of the headlamp to the GPS  and  vice  versa.  The
GPS batteries still had enough power left to operate the lowest  setting  of
LED. And so I managed to find my way back to my bike after wandering  around
in the dark for two hours, switching my GPS on every 15 minutes or so for  a
course correction all  the  while  hoping  it  wouldn\'t  die  again.  In  an
interesting footnote, while wandering around in the woods I  came  across  3
separate complete elk skeletons. The Colockum  Wildlife  Area  does  have  a
large elk population, but I was surprised to find evidence of them  in  such
dense  woods.  These  woods  were  really  dense  with   many   downed   and
crisscrossed trees that made travel difficult.   At  times  I  could  barely
find a way through much  less  a  large  animal.   Perhaps  they  pick  such
protected places to go to die. I fleetingly wondered if I might  be  joining
them.
For the trip out on bike, I  switched  the  better  batteries  back  to  the
headlamp and used  the  higher  LED  setting.  It  was  barely  adequate  to
negotiate the road and I had to keep my speed down on the steeper  descents.
 I did get  some  help  from  an  almost  full  moon  in  the  now  clearing
conditions. When I hit the  gumbo  section  of  road  again,  things  turned
positively ugly. The wheels immediately clogged so badly they wouldn\'t  turn
at all. I had to carry the bike and once past clean out the wheels  as  best
I could. There was no way to stay clean and I soon gave up  and  became  one
with the mud as it got everywhere, on my  gloves,  on  the  handlebars,  the
shifters, the seat, my  water  bottle,  my  pants,  my  boots,  my  hat,  my
glasses, my pack - you get the picture. I couldn\'t even see the brakes,  not
that it mattered. There was so much friction even after I got the wheels  to
turn again that I never needed to use them.  In fact I often  had  to  pedal
even on the downhills to keep moving. I got back to the  car  at  10:00  and
home after midnight. I did make a successful Thanksgiving  dinner  the  next
day, but it took me several hours to clean up my bike.

Lessons learned: Always carry extra batteries and do not ride a bike in  the
Colockum after a rainstorm

Total: 28 miles, 4200 ft, 11:15 hrs.

Second Try - December 2, 2004. For my second attempt  I  waited  a  week  of
mostly dry cold weather for the road to dry out. I couldn\'t wait  too  long,
though, as any heavy snowstorm would prevent access. I got an earlier  start
at 9:45. It was below freezing. I could tell immediately the road was  drier
and frozen and would give little trouble in that regard,  but  I  could  see
fresh snow on the higher hills.  No telling how deep  it  was  where  I  was
going. The road began with a stiff climb, then  leveled  out  and  descended
slightly to a lovely section near  the  bottom  of  the  canyon  and  frozen
Naneum Cr, only to climb steadily once again. At  4.4  miles  I  came  to  a
second gate and entered the Colockum Wildlife Area. I began to  run  into  a
light dusting of powder snow. I passed the gumbo section without  incidence.
Bicycling is so much more fun when the wheels turn! At 8.3 miles  I  crossed
Naneum Creek and at 9.8 miles crossed again. Now  the  road  began  climbing
more steeply.  I passed my bike highpoint of last week and continued to  the
proper junction at 12.7 miles.  This  spur  was  even  steeper  and  I  soon
stashed my bike where it crossed a ravine at 4600 ft (13.1 miles,  2300  ft,
3:15 hrs). The snow here was about 2 inches deep, no real problem.

Continuing on foot, I hiked up the ravine cutting a switchback in  the  road
and cutting a second one farther up, then easily following the road  to  the
top (15.4 miles, 3900 ft, 4:55 hrs).  The last bit was  a  very  steep  jeep
trail. Bentrim Hill is just that, a hill. Not very exciting.  More  exciting
was Pt 5537, the rocky ridge I been so close  to  last  week.  It  was  very
close and very inviting.  So, despite it getting late, on  the  way  down  I
took a little detour up it just to feel like I had climbed a real summit.  I
started my bike descent  a  little  after  4:00,  and  with  wheels  turning
freely, reached the car at 6:00.

Total: 31 miles, 4300 ft, 8:15 hrs - 26.2 miles and 2500 ft on bike

Blue Mountain (3080+ ft - 1040 ft Prominence - Wallace Lk Quad) - January
25, 2005


The easy way to do this low mountain is to drive up the  Sultan  Basin  Road
to just before Olney Pass, turn left onto the Blue Mountain  Road,  drive  a
rough 2 miles to the gate and walk a little over a mile  to  the  top.   But
easy wasn\'t the point of this trip.  I wanted a good workout with the  added
bonus of a summit and a loop. To this end, I drove up the Sultan Basin  Road
5.5 miles to a gated logging road at 740 ft and began on bicycle at 11:45.

The gate was open and as I got  myself  ready  to  go  four  logging  trucks
passed by, not a good sign. Obviously, active logging was  occurring  on  my
chosen access road, one disadvantage of cycling up logging roads during  the
week.  The well-used road began gently, and, spurred on by  the  thought  of
meeting more trucks, especially on  narrow  sections,  I  pedaled  furiously
upward making good progress. I was  passed  by  four  more  trucks,  but  it
really was not the problem I had feared, as I could hear them coming a  mile
away and had plenty of time to get well off the road. I  gave  them  each  a
friendly wave.

At 2.75 miles I passed the active logging site where  all  the  trucks  were
headed and at 3.2 miles reached the first of  several  switchbacks  climbing
Blue Mountain\'s W ridge. The road still showed signs of much recent  traffic
and did not seem to correspond to my map and I proceeded to get myself  very
confused with new roads to newly logged areas. Led  astray  by  following  a
well-used road I ended up at a dead-end on a current logging  platform.  The
diesel motor was still running on the crane but no one seemed to be  around.
Perhaps they were having lunch. Realizing my  error,  I  turned  around  and
found the correct road, which was a very obscure junction.  No wonder I  had
missed it.

My road showed no signs of use and in fact looked abandoned. It  was  steep,
rough, rocky and eroded and I pushed my bike up most of this section. I  was
now in lovely woods, a nice change from all the previous clear-cuts and  new
slash. But from the looks of all the  surveyors\'  tape  I  encountered,  the
loggers had designs on this road as well and the trees  were  not  long  for
this world.

After about an hour of pushing, the road leveled out at 2800 ft and 7  miles
on the crest of the ridge and I could start riding  again.  A  few  ups  and
downs for 1.5 miles, a final steep section and I was at the  tower  near  the
top at 2:40 (8.9 miles, 2700 ft). A 5-minute walk led  to  the  wooded  high
point after which I found a great viewpoint below the  tower.  I  ate  lunch
looking across the  Pilchuck  River  valley  toward  Mt  Pilchuck  and  Bald
Mountain.

There were a few more ups and downs continuing E along the  ridge  from  the
summit until I hit the gate. Then the road plunged downward losing  1000  ft
in two miles.  This road was better than the road I  had  ascended,  but  it
was still darn steep and rough and there were areas where it  was  necessary
to keep speed down to avoid a mishap. I was most happy to reach  the  Sultan
Basin Road at 3:50 and give my hands a rest from braking. The  rest  of  the
cruise down to the car was a fun fast descent first  on  smooth  dirt,  then
pavement. I knocked off the 8 miles in 40 minutes. Fun, fun, fun!  Made  all
that pushing worth it. Total: 20 miles, 3950 ft, 4:50 hrs.

Ten-Four Mountain (4384 ft - 2744 Prominence - Gold Bar Quad) - January 27,
2005


It looked so easy on the map.  A series of logging roads led to within  half
a mile and 300 feet of the top of this mountain. To be  sure,  it  would  be
over 4000 feet of elevation gain and 20  miles  so  I  expected  a  workout.
What I didn\'t expect was how bad some of the roads would be, the  wet  brush
and impenetrable second growth to the  top,  and  the  snow.  With  all  the
melting of the past weeks I really didn\'t  think  a  puny  4384-foot  summit
would have snow.  How quickly we become spoiled and forget.

I began at 10:55 up a gated logging road off Ben Howard Road out of  Sultan,
elevation 130 ft. Things began well despite the fact that it  was  drizzling
and that the gate was open which usually means active logging. Sure  enough,
I was soon passed by a couple a logging trucks.  I guess that  is  why  they
are called logging roads. But the road itself was smooth, if  a  bit  muddy,
and quite gentle for the  first  5  miles  gaining  only  750  ft  wandering
through woods past ponds and creeks and funny  little  blobby  hills,  which
made for very pleasant pedaling. Then the climbing began. After huffing  and
puffing and pushing for 2 more miles and 1000 feet I passed the  turnoff  to
the active logging and continued straight ahead. The road had been  recently
graded for another half mile through a new  clear-cut,  which  rendered  the
surface loose, muddy and unstable. I made a note to use caution on  the  way
down. Soon all signs of recent traffic ended  as  the  road  entered  woods,
climbed steeply and gradually deteriorated while I mostly walked and  pushed
for another mile to tiny Airplane Lake. I carried my bike across the  washed
out crossing of the outlet creek to the road continuing on the  other  side.
It had quit raining and I had a pleasant quick lunch at the  lake  at  1:45,
3100 ft and 8.3 miles.

From  the  lake  things  turned  ugly  as  the  "road"  degenerated  into  a
completely washed out rocky stream bed and I had to push and carry the  bike
up and over and around boulders for most of the next .8 mile and  500  feet.
Near the end were lovely views of the Skykomish River valley.  I topped  out
on the ridge at 2:25, 3600 ft and 9.1 miles, took a quick side trip W  to  a
tower and more views, and then headed E  along  the  S  side  of  the  ridge
toward Ten-Four.

The road remained rough but rideable until all at once I began to  run  into
patches of snow. This took me by surprise.  There had been no signs of  snow
up to this point.  Snow in January! Who would have  thought?  I  pushed  the
bike through a few patches until stopped by a longer section.  Here  I  left
the bike at 3:10, 3900 ft and 10.7 miles, and  walked  the  remaining  short
distance to the end of the road, maybe Â¼ mile and 150  ft,  where  I  headed
uphill toward the summit ridge. Once again things turned ugly as  I  entered
second (or maybe third or  fourth)  growth  at  its  worst.  Wet  brush  and
impenetrable thick scrubby evergreens and downed logs all with  intermittent
slushy snow conspired to make progress difficult. To make matters  worse,  I
was in cleated  bike  shoes,  completely  inadequate  for  the  terrain  and
conditions. I did have on good rain gear so the rest of me stayed  dry,  but
my feet were soon soaked. Had I realized what I was  in  for  I  would  have
used toe clip pedals so I could wear better boots.  Clip-in  pedals  are  so
much more efficient for pedaling, but they were a bad choice for this trip.

It had looked so easy on the map - maybe Â½ mile cross-country from  the  end
of the road. It took me 40 minutes to struggle that short  distance  to  the
top at 4:00. The summit was in older forest and showed no  signs  of  anyone
having been there. I doubt this summit is high on many people\'s  list.   The
trip down was no more pleasant but  it  was  faster.  Once  on  the  road  I
stopped to wring out my dripping socks and place plastic bags over  them  in
an effort to reduce evaporative cooling on the ride  down.   I  had  no  dry
socks along. I reached my bike at 4:35 and the junction  off  the  ridge  at
4:55. I had to walk the bike down the awful road  to  Airplane  Lake,  which
was fine with me as it allowed my frozen feet to warm up a bit. I  rode  the
rest of the way down from the lake. I hit the  unstable  section  of  graded
road noted on the way  up  in  fading  light.   I  was  aware  of  it,  took
precautions and still lost it and took a tumble. At  least  I  wasn\'t  going
very fast and didn\'t get hurt. Anticipating a long trip  and  possible  late
return I had carried my heavy 15-watt Nite Rider bike light with me. At  the
junction with the  logging  activity  at  5:30,  I  put  the  light  on  and
negotiated the rest of the way back to the car by its  generous  lumination.
The last 5 mile gentle section was even rather fun in the dark.   I  reached
the car at 6:35.  The logging gate was now closed.

Total: 21.2 miles on bike, 1.5 mile on foot, 4500 ft gain, 7:40 hrs.

Cascade Lookout (3702 ft) & Phelps Ridge (Devils Slide Quad) - February 1,
2005


This is not really much of a summit as it only has prominence  of  a  little
over 200 ft (although it might almost qualify if you include the  height  of
the lookout), but it is a great viewpoint and I had a  good  workout  and  a
bit of an adventure getting there. You just never know what  you  are  going
to encounter when you venture onto old logging roads.

I began by cycling up gated road 29000 (2002  GT  Mt  Si  map  is  best  for
showing roads), about 9.5 miles up the  North  Fork  Snoqualmie  River  Road
(just after crossing Deep Cr), elevation 1250 ft. After a level 1.3 miles  I
came to a 4-way junction,  crossed  main  road  29400  to  29600  and  began
climbing steadily up a series of switchbacks. At the fourth  switchback  and
a junction with 29610, elevation 2000 ft, the road was blocked by  a  downed
tree and looked very unused, not a good sign. Hoping  29610  would  continue
upward, even though the map showed it to be a dead-end, I turned  onto  this
spur and  proceeded  to  waste  45  minutes,  1.8  miles  and  400  ft  gain
confirming that it indeed led nowhere but a clear-cut.

Back at the switchback, I considered my options. I  could  retreat  and  try
and find another way up, but that would mean descending all the way  to  the
4-way junction and would essentially mean starting the trip all over  again.
 Or I could try and force my way up a road that had not been used in a  long
time, probably for a reason. Neither option  seemed  very  good,  but  I  am
programmed to go up whenever possible, not down, so up I went.

Things began badly as I encountered half a dozen fallen trees  to  lift  the
bike over or around, then improved as I left the forest and entered  an  old
clear-cut where there were  no  trees  left  to  fall  down.  The  road  was
overgrown with weeds but easily followed until I rounded  the  corner  of  a
sub ridge, entered the valley of Deep Cr and saw the  reason  the  road  was
unused - a massive rockslide had obliterated several  hundred  feet  of  the
road. Now a sane person would have ended  the  trip  here,  but  I  probably
don\'t qualify as such a being. So I spent the next hour  wrestling  my  bike
over and around refrigerator sized rocks and then  up  a  steep  loose  dirt
slope to the roadbed on the other side of the slide.  I took two trips,  one
with my gear to lighten the load and one with the  bike.  I  also  cut  some
small alder trees with the folding saw I carry for such emergencies so  they
wouldn\'t snag handlebars and pedals.  The slide was old  enough  for  alders
to start growing again.

Getting my bike across the slide took the limit of  my  meager  strength.  I
think I looked upon it as a challenge, the crux of the day so to speak,  and
I just wanted to see if I could do it and I was  most  happy  to  reach  the
road on the other side and start pedaling again. The road was in good  shape
now.  Soon I crossed Deep Cr and at the head of the valley, at 3000  ft  and
7 miles, intersected road 29520, my planned return route. A short ways on  I
reached the junction to the lookout, road 29660, and pushed and pedaled  the
last 1.5 miles to the top. I encountered a few snow patches along  the  ridge
but nothing that was a problem.

The lookout itself is a nifty old  wooden  structure  over  a  hundred  feet
high. The stairs winding up are in good  shape  with  sturdy  handrails  and
lead to the bare but still mostly intact room on  top.  It  is  high  enough
above the surrounding trees to give a fantastic view all  around,  from  the
Tolt Watershed to the North Fork Snoqualmie and all the surrounding peaks  -
Phelps, McLain, Bare, Red, Index, Frozen, Twin,  Dog  and  into  the  Alpine
Lakes. A great place to hang around for a while. A  very  sparse  snow  pack
was in evidence.

I had hoped to get to Mt Phelps (or Little Phelps depending  on  which  name
you like) but I had lost so much time with my misadventures it was now  2:30
and I was running out of daylight. But I had some time left  and  decided  I
could go on till 4:00. So I continued E on the  road  along  the  ridge  top
about 2 miles until it descended very steeply to rejoin 29600 at  a  saddle.
I followed 29600 up and down another 1.5  miles  E,  with  the  road  getting
rougher and rougher, until completely stopped by  another  slide  just  past
the last saddle on the ridge before the final switchbacks to the ponds W  of
Phelps, elevation 3800 ft, 13.5 miles. This could be an interesting  way  to
climb Phelps.  Someday I may come back and try it.  But it was just as  well
I was stopped here.  It was 3:55 and time to turn around.

The trip down was fast and delightful. I stayed on  29600  to  the  junction
with 29520. An annoying little climb led to a U-turn  around  a  spur  ridge
and a recently logged area then to steady descent.  The road was  steep  but
mostly smoothed by much traffic and  I  flew  downhill.   I  ran  into  more
current logging operations lower down but I was late enough in the day  that
everyone had gone home. I intersected 29500, then 29400 and  finally  29000,
closing my loop. The last bit to the car was in growing darkness and I  just
made it without needing a light at 5:40.

Total: 23.5 miles, 4100 ft gain and 7:30 hr

McDonald Mtn (3570 ft - P2170 - Eagle Gorge Quad) - February 2, 2005


I vaguely remember climbing this mountain years ago, but I am not certain  I
went to the highest point so I felt I had to go back and make sure. This  is
my first P2000 peak that I have climbed deliberately knowing it  is  on  the
list. I have been aware of this list for a while but have resisted  pursuing
it up to now.  But many of the peaks on the list can be climbed on bike  and
it gives me something to work toward  in  this  year  of  no  snow.  I  like
definite destinations for my trips.

I really shouldn\'t have done this trip the day after I wore  myself  out  on
Cascade Lookout, but the day was so gorgeous I  couldn\'t  help  myself  from
going out again. Besides, McDonald is in my backyard and only a short  drive
away, but I did get a late start. I drove to the gate off SE  Courtney  (off
Kanasket-Kangley Road).  The sign on the gate said  no  unauthorized  entry,
no ATV\'s or motorcycles but made no mention of  feet  or  bicycle.  Probably
they were allowed, but the last time I parked by such a sign I had the  back
window of my car smashed in. Maybe there was a connection or  maybe  it  was
unrelated random vandalism but it made me nervous.   So  I  continued  N  on
Kanasket-Kangley and found another entry point  at  an  unsigned  gate  just
past the intersection with Kent-Kangley, elevation 960 ft.

This jeep road turned out to be a more attractive way up through  woods  and
avoided the clear-cuts on the main logging road. It appeared  well  used  by
ATV\'s and motorcycles. I intersected the main road after an hour  of  mostly
pushing at 2260 ft and 2.2 miles. Shortly  after  was  another  sturdy  gate
that was serious in keeping out  motorized  vehicles.  I  had  trouble  just
getting my bike past it. Once past the gate I ran into 3 hikers coming  down
and stopped to chat.  They had come up from the Courtney gate and  were  not
deterred by the sign.

I passed the turnoff to the radio tower in another mile at 2840 ft. Now  the
road descended and passed another  gate  that  was  also  difficult  to  get
around. The road continued descending to 2585 ft then began a gradual  climb
on a long traverse where I could zip along at a good  clip.  I  reached  the
turnoff to the summit at 2900 ft and 6.6 miles. The  spur  to  the  top  was
rough and had deep water bars so I had  to  push  again.   On  the  ridge  I
turned left. The water bars ended but the road eventually  became  so  rough
with large loose rocks that I knew I wouldn\'t be able to  ride  down,  so  I
left the bike at 3300 ft and 7.3 miles and walked the last bit  to  the  top
arriving at 3:55. The summit was uninspiring, but I was able to get  a  semi
view by working my way through young alder to the edge of the ridge.

The nice thing about biking is the best comes last. At times  you  don\'t  go
any faster uphill than walking, but  on  the  level  and  downhill  you  can
really move. I did have to walk down to the main road  and  then  there  was
that distressing 300 ft climb back to the tower turnoff, but the rest was  a
fun trip down and I reached the car at 5:30.

Total: 14.6 miles on bike, 0.75 mile on foot, 3300 ft gain and 4:15  hr.    Fay

Drunken Charlie Mountain (2840+ ft - 460P - Sultan Quad) - February 5, 2005


I wanted to do this trip on the weekend when  I  wouldn\'t  have  to  contend
with logging trucks on the  North  Fork  Snoqualmie  Mainline  road.  I  had
planned for Sunday but the forecast was bad with lowering snow levels so  at
the last minute I decided to go Saturday hoping to beat the snow.  Ha!  This
got me another late start, really too late for such a long trip  but  I  had
my trusty bike light along and figured I could come out in the dark.

I began from 5.4 miles up the North Fork road at the first gate on the  left
past Spur 10 gate, elevation 1040 ft. There was already 2 inches of snow  on
the ground here from the storm on Friday.  So much  for  beating  the  snow.
But I didn\'t have to break trail as  the  mainline  logging  road  was  well
tracked from traffic on Friday. However, from what I could see on the  hills
higher up I knew I would be running into even more snow.  I wasn\'t sure  how
far I could get, but I decided to give it a try anyway.

I began on mile after mile of almost  level  road,  great  for  making  good
time. Gradually the snow depth got less as some had melted in the sun  or  I
just got out of the microclimate that had produced it in  the  first  place.
By the time I crossed the South Fork Tolt River at 8.8 miles  the  road  was
completely bare. I crossed the North Fork  Tolt  at  12.8  miles,  elevation
1175 ft, and finally began to climb. By the time I reached 2100 feet  I  was
back in consistent snow, but again vehicle tracks  helped  me  out  until  I
took a left turn heading toward Yellow Cr and the tracks went straight.  Now
I was on my own in 2-3 inches  of  snow.  It  is  amazing  to  me  how  much
friction there is breaking trail in snow with a bicycle. I had to work  just
to pedal on the level. Forget about pedaling uphill.

At 16.8 miles, elevation 2370 ft, I crossed Yellow Cr  and  turned  left.  A
short ways on a spur led up and right and I was forced to  push.  It  wasn\'t
really that steep but the ever deepening snow made pedaling too  much  of  a
chore. I reached the high point of the road at 19 miles and took 10  minutes
to wander around in the rolling woods just off to the left looking  for  the
summit.  It was not obvious exactly where it was but I must have crossed  it
at some point.

I turned around at 4:50 and proceeded to slip and slide down.  Bicycles  are
not terribly stable in snow. Up here I couldn\'t get my feet  clipped  in  as
both the pedals and cleats were choked with snow, but I really  didn\'t  want
them locked in anyway. Wheels, chain and cogs were also  filled  with  snow.
At least snow, as opposed to mud, melts off cleanly. I made it to  the  main
tracked road at 5:40 where I stopped to put on  my  light.  A  fast  descent
followed to the North Fork Tolt, then the endless miles  of  level  pedaling
that seemed to go on forever before reaching the car at 7:55.

It goes without saying that this would make for a much nicer bike ride  with
summer conditions for those into long distances and fast  cruising.  Without
snow the roads could be pedaled all the way  to  the  top  and  coming  down
would also be faster reducing the total time significantly. And FYI  I  wore
booties over my cycling shoes to keep the snow out.

Total: 38 miles, 2800 ft gain and 7:50 hrs.  Fay Pullen

Rock Peak (3320+ ft - 2000P - Mt Tebo Quad) - February 25, 2005


I began running into old snow and ice on the Skokomish  River  Road  at  the
pitifully low elevation of 700  ft  and  began  to  think  maybe  I  was  in
trouble.  Who would have thought snow was this low after a  week  of  lovely
weather? Then I remembered that Mason County -  Hood  Canal  had  a  healthy
dose of lowland snow during the last storm and with night  temperatures  low
I guess it just didn\'t have a chance to melt.  Seeing  the  sunny  hillsides
above me were mostly snow free though, I  figured  I  could  probably  still
make my summit.

Shortly after crossing Rock Cr, I turned off the main road onto 2351,  drove
another mile, parked at the intersection with 2352 (elev 1115)  and  started
up this road by bike (for those not wishing to work so hard,  this  road  is
not gated and can be driven). It began  at  an  easy  grade  then  steepened
until I hit the main ridge at 2100 ft. The road wandered up and  down  along
the ridge gradually gaining elevation for several miles and I began  running
into snow in the shaded areas.  By the time I crossed to the  N  side  below
Rock Peak there was  a  consistent  8-12  inches  of  snow.   Fortunately  a
vehicle had been this far and left useful tracks.

I stashed my bike below the N peak and searched  for  a  way  up  the  steep
rocky hillside.  It was only 200 feet to the top, but it was a  little  more
than I had expected, a class 2 scramble made more challenging with snow  and
bike shoes.  Once on top, after taking in the  view  of  surrounding  peaks,
most notably Mt Washington, I followed the ridge to the S peak,  15  minutes
away, sinking in calf deep snow much of the way. I returned to  the  saddle,
then descended on snow directly to the road. The knee I had injured  a  week
ago skiing was already hurting again. Good thing going down by bike is  easy
on knees and I had a great run back to the car despite wet feet.  Total:  12
miles, 3020 ft and 4:10 hours.

Dennie Ahl Hill (2004 ft - 924P - Lightening Pk Quad)

Rock Peak didn\'t fill the day and since I was  right  there  I  extended  it
with a ride up to this old lookout site. Fortunately I had  a  pair  of  dry
socks in the car to replace my wet ones. I drove  back  down  the  Skokomish
River Road, turned onto 2340 and parked after about half a  mile,  elev  600
ft. The first part of this road is dead level and smooth enough for  a  road
bike although it was surprisingly wet due to melting snow  on  the  side.  I
passed the turnoff to West Lake and then crossed High Steel Bridge over  the
S Fork Skokomish River, an impressive deep rocky gorge. A short ways  on,  I
turned left onto spur 200 and followed this pleasantly graded forested  road
as it wound completely around the hill. On the N side I again ran into  snow
patches. Unfortunately, by the time I reached the top  an  evening  fog  had
developed and I got no view. The trip down was very pleasant even  though  I
reached the car after dark. I met no cars on either of these  trips.  Total:
18.4 miles, 1540 ft and 3.5 hours.

Mt. Elbert (4327 ft - 2607P - The Rockies Quad) - March 4, 2005


Continuing my quest for 2000P peaks by bike, I chose this one  near  Mineral
despite the higher elevation meaning I would most certainly be running  into
a fair amount of snow. I drove up FR 74 (off Highway 7) about  2  miles  and
parked at the first switchback, elevation 1650 ft.  The road  climbed  at  a
steady but rideable grade and I did very little pushing except  through  the
snow patches that began to appear on shady NE aspects after about  3000  ft.
Vehicles had made tracks in the snow but parts were still too  deep  or  icy
to pedal through. After crossing East Cr  twice  and  pushing  up  a  longer
snowy section, I emerged onto a saddle on the ridge to welcome  sunshine  on
southerly slopes at 3500 ft and 5.3 miles.

A pickup truck was parked here and I could hear two male voices  calling  to
each other from somewhere off the road. Not knowing what manner of  mischief
(if any) they were up to, I pedaled furiously  away.  The  road  was  fairly
level for the next mile and a half and completely free of  snow  so  I  soon
left the commotion behind me. Views  opened  up  and  I  passed  beneath  an
interesting rock ridge. At 6.8 miles I came to another saddle  where  FR  74
crossed to the N and descended some 600 ft. There appeared to be  a  lot  of
snow on the road with no vehicle tracks and also not  wanting  to  lose  all
that elevation I re-examined the map for an alternate  route.  I  discovered
an abandoned road (283) that stayed mostly on the ridge  or  S  of  it  that
joined FR 70 and reconnected with my planned route after some 2.5  miles.  I
did save about 300 ft of elevation (this road also descended,  just  not  as
much), however I still ran into a fair amount of snow. And the old road  was
rough and overgrown. I probably should have  stashed  the  bike  sooner  and
walked, but I kept being lured on by snow free sections that were rideable.

At 9.5 miles I reconnected with my planned route at the junction  of  FR  70
(which branches off FR 74) and 7312. At 10.25 miles and elevation 3700 ft  I
gained the NE ridge of Elbert and stashed the bike  where  7312  crossed  to
the N.  The snow here was too deep for the bike. I continued on  foot  until
I could see a way up the road cut. The first hundred feet or  so  was  quite
steep.  Thank heavens for bush belays. Then the angle eased off  and  all  I
had to contend with was slushy, knee-deep unconsolidated snow over  annoying
brush - a real pain. The 600 ft to  the  top  took  a  good  45  minutes  of
unpleasant postholing. This peak has been clear-cut to the  summit,  but  at
least that afforded good views. There were a  number  of  interesting  rocky
bumps around that might warrant future exploration.

It took longer to reverse the old  road  than  I  had  anticipated.  Despite
having my bike tracks to follow, it seemed to take as much work to push  the
bike through the snow going out as coming in,  particularly  on  the  uphill
section. I was pretty much done in by the time I reached  FR  74.  But  from
that point on it was just a matter of  letting  gravity  take  me  downhill.
What a pleasure!

Total: 20.5 miles on bike, 1 mile on foot, 3800 ft and 7:45 hrs.

Whacme Mtn (3087 ft - 2727P - Lake Whatcom Quad) - March 6, 2005


This mountain may have a local name.  I saw it referred to as Haner  Mtn  on
a map of the Mt Baker area and I ran across a sign on the DNR  logging  road
mentioning the Haner Ranch forest plantings. Whatever its name, this is  the
mountain E of Lookout Mtn on the other side of Lake Whatcom.

My access was up a gated DNR logging road on the S side that left Highway  9
a couple of miles S of Acme, elevation 380 ft. It began  in  clearcuts,  but
immediate and almost constant views of the Twin Sisters and  Mt  Baker  made
up for the initial ugliness as I mostly pushed up the very  steep  road.  At
1.4 miles I went left at a junction and at 2.3 miles came to a  power  line.
At 4.5 miles and 2700 ft the road  leveled  off  for  fast  cruising  as  it
traversed, then gradually dropped 200 ft to  a  4-way  intersection  at  5.9
miles. Here I took the rightmost branch under the power line again,  crossed
a creek, passed under a bright red gate and began the final steep  climb  to
the top at 7.25 miles.

On logged over summits it is sometimes difficult to  determine  the  highest
point, which often may be nothing more than a stump or pile  of  slash,  but
this time I settled on real earth as worthy of that designation.  I  ate  my
lunch  in  a  very  light  (almost  non-existent)  drizzle  watching  clouds
gradually lower over Mt Baker and the Twin Sisters and begin to  obscure  my
view. I found myself hoping that the clouds would turn  into  a  real  storm
and actually dump some much needed precipitation. No such luck.  All  I  got
were clouds.

I met a motorcyclist coming up as I left the summit.  We chatted a bit.   He
had come up from Lake Whatcom on the N side and volunteered  that  his  mode
of transportation was less work than mine, but that on occasion he too  rode
a mountain bike. He passed me again  about  half  way  down  and  asked  for
confirmation that the road we were on led to Highway 9  and  that  he  could
get his motorcycle around the gate. I told him there was no problem  and  he
was off to make his grand loop, and I to make my final fast  plunge  to  the
car.

Total: 14.5 miles, 3200 ft and 4:30 hrs.

Huffaker Mtn (3640 ft - 2320P - Cowlitz Falls Quad) - March 10, 2005


I chose the wrong approach road for this mountain relying on the  map  being
accurate.  It was not. Things started well. I parked at the intersection  of
FR 25 and 2505,  some  5  miles  S  of  Randle,  elevation  1149.  2505  was
moderately graded, smooth treaded, little used with grass growing  down  the
center, and wandered through attractive  woods,  everything  a  forest  road
should  be  for  pleasant  bike  pedaling.  But  shortly  after  the  fourth
switchback it suddenly ended at a junction at 5.1 miles and 2950  ft.  4X4\'s
had gone left, but the map indicated my route was  right  even  though  this
showed no use.  I followed it a short ways but was soon  stopped  by  fallen
trees and brush.  The road was  completely  abandoned.  I  then  tried  left
following the jeep tracks. These soon ended at a  turnaround.   I  continued
on the overgrown spur following it to its end a short ways  on,  5.25  miles
and 3050 ft.

I now had little other choice but to stash the bike and  head  off  on  foot
the remaining half mile and 600 feet to the top. I had not  planned  on  any
footwork as the map showed the road going all the way to the summit.  I  was
dressed in shorts and SS shirt on this very warm day and was not pleased  to
have to pick my way  uphill  through  brush  trying  to  avoid  getting  too
scratched. But by going slow and wandering around a bit I was able to  avoid
the worst of it. Then to add insult to injury,  at  about  3400  ft  I  came
across a good road. Darn!  Where  did  this  road  come  from?  Whatever,  I
followed it the rest of the way to the top where I had a nice view of Mt  St
Helens still belching some steam.

I decided to follow the road down a ways to see  where  it  came  from,  and
thinking maybe I could find a link back to Rd  2505  and  avoid  the  brushy
crosscountry section. I followed it over a mile to 2800 ft  before  figuring
out that I descending to the W (I was to the E)  and  would  never  hook  up
with my road. I never saw any sign of where 2505 would  have  joined  in.  I
later determined that this road must  be  the  undesignated  4WD  road  that
climbs the S and W slopes from Woods Cr Road. So I had to retrace my  steps.
Once back to my bike and down the spur it was a very pleasant cruise to  the
car. I did like this road.

Total: 10.5 mile by bike, 1  mile  on  foot,  2630  ft  and  3:45  hrs  (not
counting my detour)

Bluff Mtn (2600 ft - 1020P - Greenhorn Buttes Quad) With  several  hours  of
daylight left I decided to add this bonus. I began  from  the  gate  several
miles up Road 2506 where it intersects 037, elevation  1735.  This  gate  is
closed from Dec to April to protect wildlife habitat.  It  must  be  working
because as I cycled up this pleasant  road  I  saw  over  a  dozen  deer.  I
followed 2506 then 056 to the end at  2.6  miles  and  2550  ft,  walked  10
minutes to the wooded summit and zipped back to the car. Total:  5.2  miles,
875 ft, 1:40 hrs.

I then tried to get up Kraus Ridge (2400+ ft, 480P) starting from  the  same
point, up spur 037 (also  gated)  but  again  the  map  wasn\'t  accurate.  I
pedaled up to the  ridge  at  2000  ft  and  descended  to  1800  ft  before
realizing I had missed the road that was supposed to stay on the  ridge.   I
never saw any sign of it. As it was getting dark and I would have over  half
a mile to go crosscoutry along the ridge I quit for the day, satisfied  with
two summits.

Lyman Hill (4280+ ft - 3400P - Sedro-Wooley North Quad) - March 27, 2005


I certainly picked the hard way up this mountain.  Whatever  you  do,  don\'t
go the way I did, at least not with a bike.

I started from the gate on Pipeline  Road  1.2  miles  from  Highway  20  in
Lyman, elevation 400 ft, in a light rain.  The  forecast  for  the  day  was
more rain so I expected and was prepared to get wet.  The  map  showed  this
road to climb the S slopes of Lyman Hill and then join a  road  coming  from
the mainline logging road to Lyman Pass to the E.  This  it  did,  sort  of.
However, after about a mile it rapidly deteriorated to  a  quad  track  that
was narrow, rough, rutted, muddy and overgrown.  Then  after  a  switchback,
bad became worse as the old roadbed was completely decommissioned with  deep
ditches where culverts had been removed at every creek  crossing.  Even  the
quads gave up. I continued to wrestle my bike across the many trenches,  all
the time seriously debating whether I should  just  admit  defeat  and  turn
around. I decided to at least go as far as the junction with the  road  from
the E.  If things didn\'t improve, then I would turn around.

At 4 miles and 1600 ft I hit the junction, which turned out to  be  a  well-
maintained and well-used logging road. I  kicked  myself  for  not  choosing
this road in the first place. With a late start and having used up almost  2
hours just to get this far, time was getting away  from  me,  but  with  the
prospect of a good road to pedal up from now on, I felt I could  still  make
the top and get most of the way down before dark. I had to  stay  alert  and
constantly refer to  the  map  to  choose  the  correct  fork  at  the  many
junctions in the road. At 9 miles and 3600 ft I stashed the bike, after  the
gradually increasing snow depth became too deep for  pedaling,  and  slogged
the last 1.5 miles to the top, which was  adorned  by  a  cluster  of  radio
towers of various sizes and shapes. The rain had turned to snow.

Back at the bike, I put on all my clothes and changed to dry gloves for  the
ride down.  The weather was getting worse and it was raining harder  now.  I
wisely passed on my  uphill  route  from  Pipeline  Road,  sticking  to  the
logging road all the way down. I crossed Jones Cr, passed a  gate  and  came
to the mainline road just at dark, 17 miles and  580  ft.  I  then  unwisely
tried to find a shortcut to Highway 20. The mainline  road  meanders  E  for
3.5 miles before hitting 20 some  3  miles  from  Pipeline  Road.   The  map
showed several lesser roads going W that would have saved some mileage.  The
only problem was I couldn\'t find the right one. I wandered  around  dead-end
roads in the dark for over an hour only to end up having to go back  to  the
mainline road after all.  You would think I would  have  learned  my  lesson
earlier - STICK TO THE MAIN ROAD!

Fortunately, I was able to do most of the mileage back to Pipeline  Road  on
Hamilton Cemetery Road which parallels 20 and 20 has  a  wide  shoulder  for
the .8 miles where I was forced onto it. The  last  bit  was  the  1.2  mile
climb up Pipeline Road to the most welcome sight of my  car.  The  word  wet
doesn\'t do justice to my condition upon arrival.

Total: 4400 ft,  28  miles  and  7.5  hours  (not  counting  my  crazy  lost
wanderings).

Captain Point (5724 ft - 764P - Captain Point Quad) - March 30, 2005


I was able to drive to the Martin Cr TH for the Iron Goat  Trail,  elevation
2400 ft, before being stopped by some 4-6 inch of new  wet  slushy  slippery
snow. Fresh vehicle tracks continued but I soon caught  up  to  them  on  my
skis in the form of 3 pickup trucks stuck and  in  the  process  of  turning
around and unloading snowmobiles in the middle of the road. It is beyond  me
why they didn\'t stop at the TH before they got  stuck  and  where  they  had
plenty of room to park and maneuver. It is not like they  saved  any  energy
by not having to walk farther- they had snowmobiles for goodness sakes.

Whatever, I made use of the snowmobile  tracks  and  didn\'t  have  to  break
trail for a mile or so until their tracks headed uphill to the  right  on  a
side road toward Windy Ridge and I continued  straight  ahead  on  the  main
road. A short ways on, I turned left  at  a  junction,  crossed  Martin  Cr,
turned right, passed a gate and began a long slow climb. After 2.5  hours  of
hard work breaking trail in ever deepening snow, I left the road at the  5th
switchback, elevation 4500 ft, heading for the saddle S  of  Captain  Point.
Progress that had  been  slow  became  even  slower  as  snow  deepened  and
steepened. Another exhausting hour and half got me to the open  basin  below
the saddle. On the final climb to the ridge, progress  that  had  been  slow
became almost non-existent.  The last few feet were too steep and  deep  for
skis.  I had to take them off, then excavate a trench uphill compacting  the
snow as I went to form steps firm enough that I wouldn\'t  sink  in  over  my
waist.  This is the most snow I have run into all "winter".

It took an hour to force my way to the saddle  and  another  30  minutes  to
work my way the short distance along the ridge to the summit. Sunbreaks  and
partial views revealed a newly created winter wonderland,  a  sight  I  have
not had enough of this year.  The ski down was fast but clumsy in  the  deep
snow.  I emerged onto the road 30 minutes later looking like a snowman.   My
solitude was immediately disrupted by 2  snowmobiles  coming  uphill.  Where
were they when they would have done me some good in  breaking  trail  on  my
way up?  Now all they did was destroy my track and form deep ruts that  made
skiing down the road a challenge. But once back to  the  main  road,  enough
snowmobiles had been by that the track was smooth  and  facilitated  a  fast
pleasant run the rest of the way to car, even on the flat sections.  At  the
bottom I passed more trucks parked smack in the middle  of  the  road,  this
time loading snowmobiles. I had no idea this  road  was  such  a  mecca  for
these machines. I thought I would have the place to myself.

Total: 12 miles, 3400 ft, 6 hrs up and 1:30 hrs down.

Anderson Mtn (3364 ft - 3034P - Lake Whatcom Quad) - April 3, 2005


I began this ride from the DNR gate on Alger Mtn Road, elevation 350 ft,  on
the SW side of Anderson Mtn. The gate was open and in fact looked as  if  it
hadn\'t been closed in a very long time. As I was  unloading  my  bike  in  a
steady rain, a convoy of trucks pulling trailers filled  with  quads  passed
by headed uphill. Once they passed, though,  I  had  the  pleasant  road  to
myself and I was able to pedal up the  moderate  grade  all  the  way  to  a
gravel pit at 3.7 miles and 1800 ft.

Once past the pit, the road steepened and  began  to  switchback.   A  short
ways on I met the herd of quads coming downhill. I have no idea  where  they
had been or where they  came  from  as  I  never  saw  their  trucks  parked
anywhere. At the second switchback, elevation 2400 ft,  the  rain  began  to
turn to snow and snow started appearing on the road. The 4-wheelers\'  tracks
allowed me to continue with my bike for  a  while,  but  shortly  after  the
third switchback, at 5.8 miles and 2800 ft, the snow became  too  deep  even
for them and their tracks stopped. Here I stashed the bike and continued  on
foot.

I slowly plodded along the now almost level road with  wet  snowfall  adding
to the already 8-12 inches of snow on the ground.  At one point I looked  up
to see a cat-like creature stroll across the road and into the woods a  mere
100 feet from me.  Size and the lack of a tail indicated it to be a  bobcat.
 It was either unaware of or unconcerned  by  my  presence.  After  about  a
mile, I rounded the nose of the S ridge of Anderson and  started  N  up  the
spur road along the ridge. I stuck to  the  main  track  for  another  mile,
taking a left then two rights at junctions until coming to a  switchback  at
a saddle.  From here it was a short but snowy wet trek  into  the  woods  to
the high point.

I didn\'t relish the thought of the 2-mile plod back to my  bike,  1  mile  S
along the ridge then another mile N again along the main  road.  Looking  at
the map, it seemed like it would be so simple to head directly  W  from  the
summit and cut across both roads, a distance of no more than .3 of  a  mile.
Of course, things are never  as  simple  as  they  look,  and  I  knew  they
wouldn\'t be. For one thing, I didn\'t have my GPS  with  me  (It,  or  rather
it\'s software, was under repair).  Nor did I have a compass (Shame on  me!).
I know how confusing things can get once you are surrounded by the  sameness
of dense forest and terrain. Without  a  direction  indicator  would  I  get
myself in trouble? For another  thing,  the  terrain  was  unappealing,  all
snowy and brushy.  I would get all wet.  But then I was  already  wet.   How
much wetter than wet  can  one  get?  In  the  end  I  couldn\'t  resist  the
shortcut. And, yes, I did get very confused and I did get wetter  than  wet,
even slithering down a creek bed and wading through a marsh,  but  not  only
did I hit the road but I came out right at my  bike  and  it  only  took  30
minutes. I was most pleased.

I went slowly through the snow, but once on dirt again  I  zipped  down  the
road on my trusty bike at speeds at times  in  excess  of  20mph  hoping  to
reach my warm car before my entire body turned into a frozen Popsicle. As  a
footnote, when I unloaded my bike at home, the back tire was flat.  I am  so
glad the tire lasted until I got to the car.

Total: 11.6 miles by bike, 2.3 miles on  foot,  3000  ft  and  5  hrs.   Fay

Boistfort Pk (3120+ ft - 2680P - Boistfort Pk Quad) - April 8, 2005


The nice thing about pursuing silly lists is that it gets you to places  you
would never go otherwise. This peak took me to the SW part of the state,  an
area I have seldom visited. Beginning in Pe Ell on Highway 6, I turned  left
onto Pe Ell-McDonald road (signed to Vader),  right  onto  Halsea  Cr  Road,
left onto a main logging road and right again, parking by the open  gate  on
the road leading up the N ridge of Boistfort  Pk,  elevation  800  ft.  Rain
that  had  been  forecast  for  the  day,  especially  in  the  S,  did  not
materialize and I started in semi-sunshine.  Biking is  certainly  more  fun
when it isn\'t raining!

The road began steeply, climbing 1000 ft in 2 miles, then leveled off a  bit
upon reaching the ridge,  where  pedaling  and  views  of  tree  farms  were
enjoyable.  I went left at a main junction at 2.7 miles and  straight  ahead
at a 4-way junction at 3.2 miles, elevation  2200  ft.  A  mostly  level  to
slightly down section on the E side of the ridge went past  recent  logging,
then through nice woods, to a Weyerhaeuser  "red dot" gate at  a  switchback
at 5 miles (a red dot means no public vehicle entry). A steep  .5  mile  led
back to the crest for the final up and down, but mostly up, 1.5 miles  along
the ridge to the top. The last mile was very steep indeed, gaining  800  ft,
and got progressively rougher.  At  the  last  junction,  when  the  tallest
summit tower was in view, I erred in taking a  right  spur  directly  toward
it. This soon dead-ended.  I had to backtrack and take the left spur,  which
circled around to the S before reaching the cluster of 6 COM towers on  top,
7 miles.

I started down 30 minutes later.  I just love my new  bike.  I  am  still  a
very cautious downhill rider, often walking down suspicious terrain  that  I
feel could be hazardous to my health.  But with this  bike  I  can  go  down
things I never would have tried with my old bike.   Rear  suspension  really
does help, as do disk brakes.  Anyway, I was able to  ride  down  the  steep
stuff, although slowly, then cruise the rest (except for the short  annoying
uphill sections) and zip  back  to  the  car  in  under  an  hour.  This  is
definitely logging country but, although I  could  hear  truck  traffic  and
active logging going on in the distance, I met no one on my  route  and  had
the whole peak to myself. I drove  back  to  I-5  through  lovely  Boistfort
Prairie.

Total: 14 miles, 2900 ft and 4 hrs.

Welldiggers Ass (5273 ft - 433P - Labyrinth Mtn Quad) - April 12, 2005


Whoever came up with this name?  I agree with John Roper and like  the  name
Yodelin Mtn better. Whatever the name, this mountain makes a pleasant  short
ski trip. I began at the old logging road 3.3 miles E of Stevens Pass,  just
before the highway divides, elevation  3200  ft.   A  small  plowed  pullout
allows parking for 2 or 3 cars.

About Â½ inch of new snow dusted the road at the start.  This grew  to  maybe
3 inches at road end and 4-5 inches on the summit. Weather for the  day  was
alternate snow showers, heavy at times, and sun breaks. The road  is  gentle
enough not to require skins, but it is quite overgrown in places with  small
alder trees. This slowed me down as I wound my way through  and  stopped  to
break off enough branches to help on the downhill run.  A  heavier  snowpack
would cover  more  of  these  obstacles.  I  followed  the  road  through  7
switchbacks to its end at 4800 ft where I put on skins for the  final  steep
climb up an old clear-cut, then woods, topping out directly on  the  summit,
3 miles, 2100 ft and 3 hrs.

For variety, I continued SW along the ridge toward  Pt  5023  descending  to
the saddle then climbing that gentle bump. A nice downhill run back  to  the
saddle and down open clear-cut slopes to intersect  the  road  at  the  last
switchback followed. The road itself could have been twice as fast  but  for
the annoying alders.  I had to keep speed down to avoid getting  tangled  up
in booby traps.

Total: 7.3 miles, 2300 ft and 5:30 hrs.

Mt Walker (2804 ft - 2044P - Mt Walker Quad) - April 14, 2005


This is one of those mountains that I have driven past countless  times  but
never stopped to hike up or even drive up (there is a trail up  it  as  well
as a road).  That was before I knew it was a 2000P peak  and  before  I  was
into biking up as many of those as I could.

The Mt Walker road begins off Highway 101 S of Quilcene, elevation  750  ft.
I soon passed the TH for the trail up the mountain where several  cars  were
parked and I almost got tangled up with a hiker\'s overly friendly dogs.  The
entire 4.5 miles of road was a steady  consistent  unrelenting  500  ft  per
mile climb. With no level sections for a rest, I just kept pedaling away  in
granny gear and 90 minutes later emerged onto the N  viewpoint  to  a  short
but furious hailstorm. I  caught  glimpses  of  snow-covered  Olympic  Peaks
through the clouds, then pedaled to the S viewpoint for  a  better  view  of
Quilcene Bay, after which I flew down the road in 18  minutes  flat.  Total:
9.8 miles, 2100 ft and 2:20 hrs.

What to do now? I was not ready to end the day, but neither  was  I  up  for
another big effort, so I went looking for bonus peaks in  the  area  that  I
could drive most of the way up. My first attempt was Buck Mtn  (3760+  ft  -
1000P - Mt Walker Quad). I  drove  up  Rocky  Brook  road  (FR2620),  almost
directly across 101 from the Mt Walker road, but  was  stopped  by  snow  at
2600 ft on the spur leading to the summit. Slogging  up  the  road  did  not
appeal.  On to Plan B and lower summits. I  continued  on  the  Rocky  Brook
road to the Jackson Cr road following it and a spur to  an  end  (some  snow
encountered on the way but my Cherokee made it through) on the  E  ridge  of
Mt Turner (3400+ ft - 520P -Brinnon Quad), elevation 3000 ft.  I  hiked  the
remaining 1/3 mile up and back down the  ridge  in  wet  snowy  rhododendron
thickets to the densely wooded summit in 47  minutes.  Believe  me,  Olympic
rhododendrons can rival the worst Cascade brush. I then drove back down  the
Jackson Cr road to the end of the rough spur on the E  side  of  Green  Hill
(2380 ft - 420P - Brinnon Quad) where a 5 minute walk put me on the  top  of
that hill.  I did not  feel  the  same  sense  of  accomplishment  on  these
summits that I feel after a hard  workout,  but  I  must  admit  I  had  fun
exploring miles of logging roads by car. I  also  had  nice  views  of  Hood
Canal country and saw  two  deer.  Not  too  bad.  It  certainly  is  easier
exploring by car than by bike. On the return  I  continued  down  the  Rocky
Brook road making a loop that came out on  the  Dosewallips  road  and  then
Highway 101 near Brinnon.

Goat Mtn (5407 ft - 2087P - Spirit Lk East Quad)  - April 18, 2005


I joined forces with Paul Klenke for this trip. We drove FR26 out of  Randle
to Ryan Lake and then 2612 about 2 miles, passing the Goat Mtn  TH,  parking
at spur 635, elevation 2840 ft. This spur is shown on the USGS  map  and  is
directly S of Goat\'s E summit. There was a light dusting of new snow on  the
trees, but there did not appear to be that much snow  higher  up  from  what
could be seen. We, perhaps unwisely, chose not to carry snowshoes.

We followed the overgrown brushy spur, getting quite wet in the process,  to
the 4th switchback, elevation 3800 ft, exiting right across a creek  into  a
forested band. Travel in the trees was fairly open and pleasant and we  made
good progress up the steep slope until we  hit  deep  unconsolidated  slushy
snow beginning somewhere around 4800  ft.  Thank  heavens  for  Paul\'s  long
strong legs. He broke all the trail in this section  sinking  in  well  over
his knees.  I had a hard enough time  just  following  in  holes  that  were
deeper than my short legs.

We hit the Goat Mtn trail 400 ft below the E summit and began the more  than
a mile traverse to the W and  accepted  higher  summit.  Frustratingly  deep
snow continued until we rounded a slight  corner  to  a  different  exposure
where more melting had occurred. Better conditions continued as we  followed
the ridge W to the high point. One small rocky pinnacle required a  traverse
on snowy rock ledges that added a bit of interest.

The W summit is measured as 5407 ft.  The E summit has a  5400  ft  contour.
They are obviously very close in elevation.  I  had  brought  my  clinometer
along to help determine which was really higher. All  day  the  weather  had
alternated between snow showers  and  clouds  and  sunshine  and  blue  sky.
Naturally, once we were on top, we were encased in clouds and fog and  never
really had a clear sight to the E summit. Oh  well,  there  was  always  the
chance we could do it in the opposite direction. So off to the E  summit  we
went. One hour later we were on that top and we did have a  clear  view.  We
both sighted to the W summit. Paul did a better job of it  than  I  did  and
concluded it to be 2 degrees lower as measured by the clinometer.   I  leave
it to the mathematicians to decide if that translates to mean the  W  summit
is actually lower than the E summit (I\'m told the  curvature  of  the  earth
has to be figured in).  Since I climbed  both  it  is  no  longer  of  great
importance to me.

For the return, we dropped directly S off the E summit. For  a  few  hundred
feet we were able to do a semi sitting glissade before the snow became  such
a quagmire we just sank in and went  no  where.  Deep  postholing  was  soon
replaced by slipping and sliding down remnants of  melting  snow  and  slick
mud. We stuck to the forest band all the way down, bypassing  the  overgrown
road, and hit the road Â½ mile from the car.  A much better way to go.

3:15 hr to W summit, 1 hr W summit to E summit, 1 hr down, 3300 ft total.

Badger Mtn (4254 ft - 2674P - Orondo Quad) - April 21, 2005


From East Wenatchee I drove the paved  Badger  Mtn  Road  N  several  miles,
climbing up onto the farmland plateau  of  this  broad  bulky  mountain  and
parked just S of the  intersection  with  Clark  Road,  elevation  3400  ft.
Despite starting so high I was still able to get in my desired  2000  ft  of
elevation gain due to the rolling up and down nature of the terrain.

I began biking by crossing to the N of Badger Mtn Road onto a farm road  and
proceeding to seek out a back way to the summit on dirt roads.  I  found  my
map to be less than  accurate  several  times.  I  will  not  give  detailed
directions, as I doubt anyone could follow them or would want  to  for  that
matter.  Suffice it to say I wandered around a series of farm roads,  closed
roads and rough tracks, boldly passing a no trespassing sign in a farm  yard
(no one was around to ask  permission),  crossing  through  two  gates  and,
after forced cross-country across sagebrush prairie when a road just  ended,
went under two decrepit barbed wire fences before hitting a  powerline  road
and finally making my way to the dual survey markers  on  top.  Despite  the
uncertainty of my route I greatly enjoyed this ride  through  farmland  with
the ever present backdrop of the snow covered Enchantments always in view.

Not wanting to press my luck and  (rightly)  anger  some  irate  farmer  for
trespassing, I did not reverse my route,  but  sought  out  a  way  back  to
Badger Mtn Road as quickly as possible. I normally don\'t like  biking  paved
roads, but this road had little traffic and  it  was  rather  refreshing  to
actually use my big chainwheel for a change and fly downhill at  30  mph.  I
did have to be wary of some gusty crosswinds, however, or I might  have  let
it rip even faster. Total: 20.5 miles, 2170 ft and 3:50 hrs


Chelan Butte (3835 ft - 2275P - Chelan Quad) - April 22, 2005


This is one steep road, too steep really for biking up, at least for  me.  I
drove as far as I dared (and still make my  2000  ft  gain)  up  the  Chelan
Butte Road out of Chelan, parking just before the pavement ended,  elevation
1800 ft. I was mighty tempted to keep driving, but standards are  standards.
I was able to pedal a few short sections but mostly I pushed all the way  to
the top, 2000 ft in 3.5 miles and 1.5 hours.

Views from the top (and much of the way up) were outstanding - Chelan,  Lake
Chelan, snowy mountains all around, the Columbia River and right across  the
river a birdseye view of my cabin and property.   I  can\'t  believe  I  have
been going back and forth to my cabin for 25 years and never took  the  time
to come up to this viewpoint. I found a nice  rock  outcrop  away  from  the
many towers for a pleasant rest and snack. On the way down I  took  a  short
detour to Pt 3716, a better destination than the tower studded  high  point.
This is where the hang gliders and para gliders launch. Then it  was  reward
time for all my pushing as I bombed back to the car in  15  minutes.  Total:
7.2 miles, 2100 ft and 2:15 hrs

Opportunity Mtn (7502 ft - 462P - Chiwaukum Mtns Quad) and Painters Thumb
(6744 ft - 504P -Big Jim Mtn Quad) - April 26-28, 2005

Oh the best laid plans often go awry and in this  case  turned  an  expected
two-day trip into three. My plan was to hike in on day one, set up camp  and
climb Painters Thumb. On day two I would climb  Opportunity  and  then  hike
out.  I didn\'t allow for  the  difficulty  of  getting  across  the  S  Fork
Chiwaukum Cr.

My approach was up the Chiwaukum Cr Trail  off  Highway  2  (1900  ft).  The
first mile is along a gated road accessing private  land  and  homes  before
turning to actual trail always in  sight  or  sound  of  the  raging  creek.
Alternating fields of glacier lilies and trilliums decorated  the  way.  The
day was very warm and sunny. At 6 miles the trail crossed the N  Fork  on  a
good log and I proceeded up the S Fork  Trail,  past  a  junction  with  the
Painter Cr Trail, to a lovely campsite, complete with a  flat  stone  table,
in upper Timothy Meadow (4000 ft) right next to the creek (8.5  miles,  2300
ft, 4:30 hrs). There were patches of snow but most of the meadow was bare.

My original plan (A) was to continue up the trail .5 mile  to  the  junction
with the Index Cr Trail, cross the creek there and climb the W ridge to  the
top of Painters Thumb. But right across the creek from my camp  was  a  very
appealing direct route up a broad gully on the NW  slopes  (Plan  B).  There
was some brush lower down but above were open slopes soon  turning  to  snow
that went all the way to the summit ridge. The only problem  was  I  had  to
get across the S Fork Chiwaukum Cr, no trivial task. I searched  around  for
a log.  No luck. However, right at my camp the creek looked fordable. I  was
halfway across in bare feet, about knee deep, with the  deeper  and  swifter
water yet to come, when I knew I couldn\'t make it.   Already  my  feet  were
numb in the freezing water and I turned around before they wouldn\'t work  at
all.

Back to Plan A. I hiked to the Index Cr  Junction  hoping  the  trail  would
lead me to a log across the creek.  Much to my dismay,  there  was  no  log,
only a ford much worse than the one I had just tried.  I hiked all  the  way
back to camp along the bank of the creek looking for a way across and  found
nothing but a raging torrent. On to Plan C, except that I didn\'t  know  what
Plan C was yet.  I would have to ponder the matter,  or  perhaps  just  give
up.

I was annoyed that I had several hours of daylight left and nowhere  to  go.
I hadn\'t even brought a book, as I didn\'t think I would have time  to  read.
I spent an hour making a feeble attempt  to  build  a  bridge.   Impossible,
given my limited strength and the swift current.  I  did  paint  a  picture,
then turned in early, before dark. I marked  the  high  water  line  of  the
creek before going to bed.

The next morning I noticed the water line had  gone  down  several  vertical
inches. Hmmm! But my first priority was climbing Opportunity, so I  set  off
up the trail at 6:40 to that end. After about 1 mile, I left  the  trail  at
4500 ft and headed NW upslope, well to the right of the major gully  between
Opportunity and Pt 7157.  This whole slope is quite brushy.  I made  use  of
game trails and a shallow dry rocky gully, but mostly I battled brush  until
gradually getting above it at about 5600 ft. Pleasant open slopes  continued
up until I could traverse talus and scree high under the cliffs of  Pt  7157
to the saddle with Opportunity. From here  a  steep  scramble  up  rock  and
small snow patches led to the final easy walk to the high point at  the  far
end of the bare ridge (3500 ft, 4 hrs). I had carried snowshoes and ice  axe
all the way up but used neither as there was very little snow on the  south-
facing route I went up. This really surprised me given the conditions I  had
run into on Frigid and  Goat  just  a  week  ago.  Looking  across  to  more
northern exposures encompassing Snowgrass and Big Chiwaukum there  certainly
was more snow but it still looked rather pitiful for this time of year.

I left a register in the summit cairn before starting  down.  I  sought  out
snow slopes for the descent following the ridge toward Pt  6844  as  far  as
possible before traversing much lower below Pt 7157 back to my ascent  route
and arriving in camp 2.5 hours later.

This day was cloudy and cooler than yesterday. When I  looked  at  my  water
marker the level was still down.  Thus I came up with Plan  C  for  Painters
Thumb. I would try again to ford the creek at camp, but this  time  I  would
wear my boots and I would tie my scramble rope to a tree.  Then  If  I  lost
my footing at least I would be swept to the proper side. And  since  it  was
now 2:30 I would most likely spend another night. I was  able  to  wade  the
creek without too much difficulty.  The water  level  was  lower  and  boots
make all the difference in protecting feet, but that did mean my  feet  were
wet for the rest of the day.  Even though I removed socks and  insoles,  the
lining of the boots was so wet it soon soaked everything else.

The initial brush was annoying but not terrible and only lasted 500  ft  and
40 minutes. Then it was clear sailing up open slopes and snow.  Most of  the
snow was good step kicking, but deep and slushy and made my  wet  feet  even
wetter and very cold. The only hard part was near the ridge  in  the  forest
where the slope was very steep and thin snow covering frozen dirt  made  for
a very slick surface.  I had left snowshoes in camp but brought  my  ice  ax
and this was the only place I used it. Once on the snowy  ridge,  it  was  a
short walk to the small rocky summit (2750 ft, 2:40  hrs).  I  left  another
register.

It took 1.5 hrs to get  down.   I  was  little  worried  about  finding  the
crossing as once in the brush I couldn\'t see where I was going, but  I  came
out right at it and had no trouble getting back  across,  despite  the  fact
that the water level had begun to rise again. It was 7:00 and I  was  tired,
wet and cold. All I wanted to do was crawl into my warm  sleeping  bag.   It
is nice to have the option to spend another night  when  desired.  Food  was
sparse. For dinner I ate my lunch sandwich that I had never  gotten  to  and
had cup after cup of warm drink.  For breakfast I made  do  with  an  energy
bar and cup of tea. I was on my way at 7:00 the next morning and to the  car
by 10:30. Much better than dragging out the night before in the dark.

Total: 26 miles and 9000 ft

Silo Mtn (4150 ft - 2430P - Haystack Mtn Quad) - May 15, 2005


It seems like the majority of my bike rides up  2000P  peaks  are  in  lousy
weather.  Maybe the fact that I save these trips as something to  do  during
bad conditions has something to do with it. At  any  rate,  I  began  biking
from the gate (elevation 150 ft)  just  off  South  Skagit  Hwy  near  Sedro
Woolley in a steady rain. The road was a very steady steep 500 ft/mile,  but
I was able to pedal up most of it as long as I never  stopped.   I  find  it
very difficult to get going again if I stop on a steep grade.

After several switchbacks, at about 3.5 miles, the main road went right  and
I went left. The steady rain was now a downpour  and  water  poured  off  my
helmet,  dripped  off  my  nose  and  my  feet  began  getting  wet  despite
waterproof booties. Fortunately, the temperature  was  mild  so  I  was  not
cold.  At 5.5 miles I took another left and the road turned into a  pleasant
grassy mossy little used spur. After another switchback  I  pedaled  through
the saddle between Haystack and Silo. The road  went  farther  than  my  map
indicated, for which I was very grateful as I was not looking forward  to  a
wet bushwhack, traversing to directly below the summit on the  W  side  (7.9
miles). A 15 minute scramble up 250 ft of talus and steep dirt  led  to  the
wooded top.  I didn\'t even get any wetter than I already was  as  there  was
little brush and it had miraculously stopped raining.

Back at the saddle I decided to add Haystack to the itinerary.  On  the  way
up I was thinking of passing it by, as at that point it was  so  wet  all  I
wanted to do was climb Silo and get out.  But with the  rain  stopped,  both
my spirits and ambition improved.  Haystack, at 4045 ft only has 285  ft  of
prominence but it does have an official name. So I pedaled  to  the  end  of
the short grassy track to  the  SE  side  and  scrambled  up  steep  forest,
skirting an interesting cliffy area on the way, to the top.

The weather continued to improve on the 45 minute blast down to the car  and
I actually got a few views of the Skagit River Valley.

Total 16 miles, 4400 ft and 5:30 hrs.

Chiwaukum Mtns (7423 ft - 423P - Chiwaukum Mtns Quad) - May 17, 2005


I was sure lucky with my choice of route on this peak. All of it  is  cross-
country  and  I  was  afraid  I  would  run  into  thousands  of   feet   of
bushwhacking.  As it turned out it  was  all  clear  sailing,  though  quite
steep, with very little brush.  Good thing too, or I would have had  trouble
completing the climb in the time I had available.

I began at the White Pine TH E  of  Stevens  Pass,  elevation  2800  ft,  by
hiking the trail 5 minutes before heading uphill at a likely spot into  open
woods. At 3450 ft I hit the crest of a spur  ridge  where  travel  got  even
better as I followed this ridge through alternating open  areas  and  woods.
There was even a bit of a faint trail much of the way.  At 6000 ft  my  spur
ridge merged with the NW ridge of Pt 7132 as I began encountering  snow  and
I got my first view of both Pt 7132 and my objective. After a  short  narrow
rocky section, the ridge leveled out a bit with more snow. I crossed to  the
S side and traversed directly to the  saddle  between  Chiwaukum  and  7132.
This traverse was not bad, but recent storms  had  coated  the  scrub  trees
with melting rime, which got my boots and legs quite wet.

From the saddle it was an easy pleasant scramble up remnant  snow  and  rock
to the summit (4700 ft and 3:50 hrs). I expected to  find  a  register,  but
did not so I added one of mine. Visibility was  reasonable,  with  views  to
Jim Hill, Arrowhead, Big Chiwaukum, Chiwaukum Lake and  Larch  Lake,  but  I
could see weather approaching from the W.  Soon it would be  upon  me  so  I
did not tarry long.

On the way back, rather than traverse below Pt 7132 through the  wet  trees,
I went over the top and followed the ridge down until I ran into  my  uphill
tracks in the snow. By now the weather had caught up to me and it  began  to
snow. It didn\'t last long, maybe 30  minutes,  but  it  did  get  everything
white and wet (me included).

 It is always harder to follow a minor spur ridge down than  up,  as  it  is
frequently very easy to get off track, but GPS waypoints kept  me  on  route
until the very end. I didn\'t exit the spur soon enough and ended up in  very
steep  congested  woods  slithering  down  hanging  logs  trying  to   avoid
vegetated cliffs until I was able to traverse back to  the  friendly  forest
of my up route. It was only a minor detour.  Still, I was most happy when  I
stumbled out of the woods onto the trail in almost the exact  same  place  I
had left it.

Total: Maybe 6 miles, 4950 ft, 6:40 hrs.

Big Snagtooth (8330+ ft - Silver Star Mtn Quad) - May 25-27, 2005


I doubt that many climbers take  three  days  to  climb  Big  Snagtooth.  Of
course I started late on the first day and came out early on the  third  day
so that doesn\'t really count as three full  days.   Still,  it  took  longer
than I expected. Oh, I expected the summit block to give me  problems.  When
a shoulder stand is suggested to begin  the  final  moves,  just  how  am  I
supposed to achieve that going solo? But I have many  tricks  up  my  sleeve
and I was pretty sure I could find a way if I just had enough time.  What  I
didn\'t expect was the extremely icy conditions I encountered in  the  summit
gully.

Plans for the Memorial Day weekend with others didn\'t work out,  so  at  the
last minute, not wanting to let good weather go  unused,  I  changed  to  my
backup. This got me a very late start and it was  12:30  pm  before  I  left
town. Another delay of 20 minutes at the rockslide near Newhalem  (Are  they
ever going to get this fixed?  It must be going on 3  years  now.),  and  it
was 4:30 by the time I left the car on the shoulder of Hwy 20 near MP166,  4
miles E of Washington Pass (elev 4300 ft).

I dropped 250 ft down road cut debris and talus  into  the  woods  to  cross
Early Winters Cr. I looked for but found no  sign  of  any  climbers  trail.
One must be there as this is the start of the  main  route  up  Silver  Star
Mtn. I crossed the creek on  a  log  and  began  a  rising  traverse  across
numerous ravines into the Willow Cr drainage.  The day  was  warm,  my  pack
heavy with 10 extra pounds of climbing gear, and there was  moderate  brush,
all of which conspired to make progress slower than  desired.  Eventually  I
headed left steeply  uphill,  soon  intersecting  and  following  the  creek
draining Snagtooth Basin. Above 6000 ft I began  running  into  wet,  slushy
snow. At 8:15 and 6700 ft, I found a nice bivy spot on a flat knoll  to  the
left of the creek, with just enough time to set up camp and eat before  dark
(2.5 miles, 2650 ft, 3:45 hr).

I was on my way the next morning by 5:45. In 20 minutes I was  in  Snagtooth
Basin. Snow in the basin was unconsolidated,  but  as  I  turned  right  and
headed to the ridge to the S the snow turned crusty then  icy  as  I  neared
its upper melt-freeze edge.  I opted for loose scree the rest of the way  to
the  7500  ft  ridge  saddle.  Following  to  the  right  of  the  ridge  on
alternating hard snow and scree brought me to the 8200 ft  Willow  Tooth-Big
Snagtooth saddle. It was only 7:45, the summit rocks looked sunny and  snow-
free, and things were looking great.  Then it all  fell  apart.  First,  the
guidebook directions were confusing (aren\'t they often?).  One  implied  you
could climb directly from the saddle, but should avoid  the  central  gully.
Another mentioned a hidden gully with a giant chockstone (is this  the  same
as the central gully?) but said it was to the SW (it is actually on  the  SW
slope but to get to it you must go to the NE). Second, I wasn\'t  sure  which
rock block was the summit. There were three visible. I knew  you  could  see
the summit from the saddle, but that isn\'t too helpful  if  you  don\'t  know
which one it is.

I spent an hour or so checking out possibilities. A route directly from  the
saddle looked possible but more than the class 3-4 I was expecting.  I  then
contoured to the right on the SW face below a massive block but was  stopped
by a deep gully. Perhaps this was the "hidden gully". For  my  third  try  I
descended until I could contour into this  gully.   When  I  saw  the  giant
chockstone near the top I  knew  this  was  the  scramble  route.  The  only
problem was it was filled with snow.  Still, it didn\'t look that bad or  too
steep.  How wrong I was! In that  dark  shady  gully  where  the  sun  never
shines the snow was very hard. Kicking steps didn\'t make a dent.   I  hadn\'t
brought crampons so that left chopping steps.

For the next hour I chopped steps and was making progress,  however  slowly,
until I came to the end of the snow where the gully made  a  slight  jog  to
the right at a rock  step  and  things  went  from  bad  to  worse.  Here  I
encountered water ice from melting snow running down the rock and  freezing.
To continue up I had to make a dicey move to the right across the  ice  onto
a slab that also had a thin coating  of  ice.  The  first  priority  was  to
anchor myself in. Fortunately, I had put on my harness at the saddle, but  I
had not racked up.  I find a dangling rack gets in the way when  scrambling.
I was in a precarious position perched on cut steps and a rock sticking  out
of the snow, yet somehow I managed to take off my pack, get out my rack  and
slings and rope and attach myself to a horn off to the side  (thank  heavens
that was there). Then I tried to protect the step across.  No  luck.   There
were cracks all right, but they were all coated with ice.  Cams  won\'t  hold
on ice.  I\'m not sure how long I dinked around trying  to  figure  something
out. I was so focused I lost all track of time. I almost gave up,  but  with
nothing to lose I began chopping at the ice with my axe.  That didn\'t do  my
poor aluminum axe much good (for once I really wish I had  brought  along  a
heavier steel axeâ¦ and cramponsâ¦ and maybe some ice screws as well).  To  my
surprise I was able to chip the ice off the rock and  find  some  reasonable
footholds underneath. With that done I could make the step  onto  the  slab.
When  a  nice  ice-free  crack  on  the  other  side  provided  much  wanted
protection, I breathed a sigh of relief.  For me this was the  crux  of  the
climb. My troubles weren\'t over, as water ice continued in the  bed  of  the
gully (under the giant chockstone) the rest of the way to the  top,  but  so
did good cracks to provide protection.

At 11:30 I reached the top of the gully and the base of  the  summit  block,
blessedly in the sun. I anchored the top end of the  rope,  rapped  down  to
clean, re-climbed, then focused my attention on the summit block. The  first
10 feet or so were vertical, then it layed back.  It  looked  climbable  but
could not be protected. It was not that high in  total,  maybe  20-30  feet.
The other side was also accessible via a narrow ledge.  So  I  was  able  to
throw my rope over the top (took a dozen or so tries) and anchor it  on  the
other side.  That way I had the protection of a top rope to make  the  moves
onto the block. I left a register in the summit cairn,  rappelled  down  and
dismantled my top rope.

I scrambled a short ways down the ridge to a rap station and did  one  short
rappel directly to the Willow Tooth saddle. Perhaps I should  have  come  up
this way.  It had to be easier than the way I had gone. It  was  now  almost
3:00 and knew I would be spending another night. I seem to be doing more  of
that lately and I kind of like it.  I guess I am slowing down or maybe I  am
just not in as much of a hurry as I used to be. Anyway, I took the  time  to
go up Willow Tooth, an easy ascent from the  saddle,  then  ambled  down  to
camp, enjoying the gorgeous views of Kangaroo Ridge,  Silver  Star  and  the
Wine Spires on the way, arriving at 4:30 (2300ft, 10:45 hr). I made  it  out
to the car by 10:00 am the next day.

Total: A pitiful 7 miles and 5200 ft in 3 days.    Fay Pullen

Flora Mtn (8320 - Pinnacle Mtn Quad) - June 2-4, 2005


Flora is really an easy peak, but getting to it is not.  Of several  choices
for an approach, I picked the one  from  Ten  Mile  Pass  above  Holden,  as
described in Peggy Goldman\'s book Washington\'s Highest Mountains.  I  really
should know better than to trust this book as it  has  led  me  astray  many
times. I even had reservations before starting out. Checking out  the  route
on the map, where it goes over the ridge at the 7800 ft pass between  Devore
Cr and Riddle Cr (just N of Riddle Pk) it seemed to me the contour lines  on
the other  side  where  you  are  supposed  to  descend  looked  darn  close
together, maybe even cliffy! But  I  convinced  myself  that  contour  lines
don\'t tell everything and there must be a scramble  route  down  that  isn\'t
obvious from the map.  After all the book said it was so.  I  really  should
have known better.

After the usual hassles and delays of taking the boat  up  Lake  Chelan  and
the bus to Holden, it was 1:30 by the time I started on the  10  Mile  Falls
trail from the village, elev 3200 ft. But I didn\'t have far to  go.  A  wide
groomed trail led 1 mile to the falls, then started uphill in earnest as  it
steepened and narrowed, climbing above the gorge  before  dropping  back  to
creek level. The trail stayed reasonable, though it  became  rougher  and  a
bit brushy, to a nice campsite along the creek at 4600 ft, where  it  ended.
I continued a short ways upstream on a very faint trail to where  the  creek
draining Ten Mile Pass joined Ten Mile Cr on the other side. A cairn  marked
this spot.  I waded Ten Mile Cr rather than  risk  getting  wet  boots  this
early in the trip by falling off a slippery log. I followed to the  left  of
the side creek and soon ran into a way trail marked by yellow  flagging.  At
5200 ft I hit the Devore Cr trail and followed this good trail the  rest  of
the way to Ten Mile Pass and a lovely camp, elev 6500 ft (5 miles,  3450  ft
and 4 hrs.) There was patchy snow at the pass and the sun was shining.

I awoke the next morning to fog.  Beginning at 6:50, I dropped  to  6200  ft
on soft slushy snow (so much for needing the crampons I lugged  along)  down
the N side of Ten Mile Pass.  I  then  contoured  NE  until  I  could  begin
climbing to the 7800 ft pass N of Riddle Pk. Two snow fingers through  cliff
bands necessitated the use of ice axe, but the snow remained soft.  At  9:00
I arrived at the pass, peered over the other side and  had  my  worst  fears
realized. It was all cliffs cut by ugly loose steep  rock  gullies  plunging
over 1000 ft to the Riddle Cr valley below.   No  scramble  route  here.  It
freaked me out just looking down. No way was I going  to  descend  that.   I
can\'t believe that anyone in their right mind would or has.  Something  must
have been left out of Goldman\'s route description.

Realizing that I could be at the end of my trip if I  didn\'t  come  up  with
something, I began looking for another way  off  the  ridge.   I  could  see
easier terrain on a rib farther N but I couldn\'t get to it  from  the  pass,
so I climbed N along the ridge toward Pt 7990 passing several minor  notches
until at one I met with reasonable scramble terrain on the other side.  Thus
began a complicated 2  hour  descending  traverse  N  over  mostly  class  2
ledges, crossing several broad gullies and one  major  rib,  until  I  could
drop down steeper class 3 terrain to snow fields and the 7000  pass  between
Pt 7990 and Pt 7716. The wide gully leading up to this pass from  Fourth  of
July Basin on Devore Cr is one  of  the  alternative  routes  for  accessing
Flora, a route I would now recommend in retrospect. Looking back at the  way
I had descended, it didn\'t look possible without a rope.  You  can\'t  always
tell just by looking.

From the 7000 pass I continued along the ridge until I could contour  around
the basin SE of Pt 7716 to the 7400 ft pass leading to  Castle  Cr.  This  1
hour contour was more trouble than it was  worth  and  it  would  have  been
easier to just descend to the basin floor at 6800 ft. Another  descent  down
very steep dirt to snow slopes below followed into the Castle  Cr  basin.  I
could pick out a possible broad ledge cutting across cliffs below the  ridge
between Flora and Pt 7734 that would save descending  all  the  way  to  the
basin floor at 6600 ft. This worked well as I  traversed  very  slushy  snow
slopes to the ledge and followed it, at a few points doubtful that it  would
continue, all the way to the snow basin SW of Flora. The  last  bit  was  an
easy but tedious ascent up scree and talus to the summit at 2:20  (6  miles,
3700 ft, 7:30 hrs). Goldman had allowed 8 hours from Ten Mile Pass to  Flora
and I had thought that surely it wouldn\'t take  me  that  long.  Well  guess
what! It was darn close to that. Everything on this convoluted route up  and
down over three passes was more difficult and took longer than I thought  it
would.

The register had been placed on 9/18/03  by  friends  and  family  of  Chris
Weber as a touching memorial to him and the last of the 100 Highest  climbed
for him. The only other entry was Don  Duncan  on  9/27/03.  I  enjoyed  the
views that were now just beginning to appear from a lifting fog, but  I  was
worried about the time.  It could take almost as long to get back as it  had
to come, what with all the ups and downs. That would put it after  dark.  So
I didn\'t stay long.

I retraced my steps to  the  7400  ft  Castle  Cr  pass.  But  from  here  I
descended directly to the basin floor to the S  at  6800  ft  and  contoured
easy terrain to the 7000 ft Devore Cr pass. I most  definitely  did  not  to
want to reverse my scramble route up the E rock face of Pt 7990 to the  7800
ft Riddle pass.  In fact I wasn\'t even sure I  would  be  able  to  stay  on
route to reverse it. Instead I headed directly down from the  7000  pass  on
easy snow toward Fourth of July Basin and Devore Cr.  At  about  6000  ft  I
began an unpleasant brushy traverse S below the cliffs on the W side  of  Pt
7990 to eventually run into the Devore Cr trail, which I was able to  follow
almost all the way to Ten Mile Pass before losing  it  in  snow.  I  dragged
into camp at 8:10 somewhat more than tired, but happy I had made  it  before
dark (12 miles, 5400 ft, 13:20 hrs).

It was very cold that night and by morning my  sopping  wet  boots,  despite
being in the tent vestibule, had frozen hard.  I  had  a  devil  of  a  time
getting them on. Too bad this hadn\'t happened the previous night.  It  would
have been much easier going on hard snow and my boots wouldn\'t  have  gotten
so wet. Despite the cold, I was on my way at 6:55 and I got down  to  Holden
at 9:30 in plenty of time to catch the Lady Express home.

Total: 22 miles and 9000 ft.

Pilot Peak (7088 ft - 1528P - Downey Mtn Quad) - June 15, 2005


Mike Collins and I joined forces for a day climb.  He  suggested  this  peak
and what a wonderful suggestion it was.  It makes for a long  and  strenuous
day but is well worth the effort. Easy travel on  an  interesting  abandoned
trail,  beautiful  forest,  open  green  ridge  rambling,  views  in   every
directions with Dome Pk front and center - what is not to like? Thanks  Mike
for getting me to an area that wasn\'t even on my radar screen.

We began up the Downey Cr Trail at the end of the washed out Suiattle  River
Road at 8:20, elevation 1400 ft. About 2 miles up the trail,  shortly  after
crossing the creek draining the W side of Downey Mtn,  an  old  trail  takes
off uphill to the right.   The  beginning  is  quite  obscure  and  hard  to
locate, but higher up the trail begins to switchback  and  is  really  quite
good. We actually missed the start  of  the  trail  but  found  it  by  just
heading uphill until we ran into  it.  Once  on  the  trail,  it  is  easily
followed (some windfall of course) through lovely moss carpeted forest  some
3 miles and 2600 ft gain to the tiny lake N of Downey, elevation 4800 ft  (3
hrs).

The trail crosses the outlet of the lake and continues up in woods  to  open
slopes gradually becoming rougher and fainter. A wet mildly  brushy  section
in the transition zone got us both soaked before it changed to  heather  and
low  vegetation.  However,  the  initially  cloudy  and  misty  morning  was
clearing nicely and the appearing sun soon dried us  out.  We  followed  the
fading trail as far as possible as it  headed  NE,  perhaps  to  Lake  5808,
before heading uphill to hit the ridge at 6600 ft, just N of Pt 6640.

We could now see our objective at the end  of  a  gorgeous  startling  green
sinuous undulating ridge. It was now just a matter of following  it  some  2
miles, mostly on the crest, all the way to the top.  Of course there were  a
few minor annoyances, there always are. For one, we had to loss  600  ft  of
elevation to a 6000 ft saddle. There was also  a  short  cliffy  section  to
downclimb (We avoided this by a traverse below it on  the  way  back).  And,
closer to the summit, a steep traverse below rocks  on  slippery  vegetation
and dirt was hard on ankles.  But for the most  part  it  was  a  delightful
high alpine ridge ramble with the backdrop of the many peaks  of  the  North
Cascades and Glacier Peak Wilderness. It really doesn\'t get any better  than
this.

We reached the small rocky summit at 2:50 (8 miles,  6600  ft,  6.5  hrs).  A
glass jar summit register revealed the small number of  ascents.   Ours  was
the 12th after mostly recognizable names such as  Mike  Torok,  Don  Beavon,
Mitch Blanton, John Roper and Stefan Fellar. We  stayed  on  the  summit  35
minutes identifying peaks all around from Snowking, Baker, Eldorado,  Goode,
Dome, Bonanza to Glacier, and many in-between.

On the way back we went the short distance to the top  of  Pt  6640  (640P),
which had another small register with  mostly  the  same  names.  We  stayed
another 30 minutes or so on the ridge soaking in the  sights  loath  to  end
this glorious day. But all good things must eventually come to  an  end  and
down we went. We reached the car at 9:15 in fading light.

Total: 16 miles, 7500 ft, and 13 hrs.   Fay Pullen

Mt Formidable (8325 ft - Cascade Pass Quad) - June 19-21, 2005


I was all psyched to climb Mt Formidable, so when the  first  3-day  stretch
of good weather in some time appeared I was ready  to  go.   When  my  usual
climbing partner Linda was not available (I  may  have  lost  her  for  this
whole season as she has taken a  summer  job.   Too  bad,  we  made  a  good
team.), I decided to go alone. I had some  trepidation  climbing  this  peak
solo. Formidable is a big mountain and fairly remote and  I  would  have  to
cross the Middle Cascade Glacier, but I would be  cautious  and  going  this
early in the season the glacier hopefully wouldn\'t have many  crevasses  and
I  have  been  having  good  success  lately.   It   never   pays   to   get
overconfident. Every once in a while I need a reality check and  a  reminder
that perhaps I have been having way too much fun. Climbing mountains can  be
dangerous and if you go out  often  enough  something  is  bound  to  happen
eventually.

I headed up the Cascade Pass Trail  (elev  3600  ft)  in  warm  sunny  clear
weather.  For once I  had  a  chance  to  wear  shorts.   From  the  pass  I
continued on the climbers trail up Mix-up Arm to Cache Col.  This  route  is
now about half melted out.  Steep snow slopes still need to be  crossed  but
the snow was soft and no problem other than  the  work  of  breaking  trail.
The greatest difficulty was crossing the rib about  halfway  where  a  large
cornice made it difficult to climb down onto the Cache Glacier. I could  see
old tracks crossing the glacier that were partially  filled  in  with  fresh
snow, probably from the heavy precipitation  the  area  had  had  the  night
before. From Cache Col (elev 6900 ft) I descended 800 feet to a  spectacular
camp at Kool-Aid Lake, elev 6100 ft (6.5 miles, 3400 ft, 5:20 hrs).

I arrived in plenty of time to lounge around,  sketch,  and  scope  out  the
route.  I identified the Red Ledge that crosses the  rock  cliff  on  the  W
ridge of Arts Knoll. It was partially snow covered and I hoped  it  wouldn\'t
be as bad as it looked. I was quietly eating  dinner  and  reading  my  book
when I glanced up and was shocked  to  see  a  coyote  nonchalantly  walking
through my camp.  I was on one side of my tent, he on the other not  5  feet
away. He continued sauntering up the path never once looking my way,  almost
like I didn\'t exist. I blinked.  He was still there  and  I  watched  as  he
disappeared from sight. Had I just dreamed that? It was like an  apparition.
In retrospect, I now wonder if he was an  omen.   In  Native  American  lore
coyote is the trickster. Were the mountains about to play a trick on me?

I started at 6:00 the next morning, another beautiful warm sunny  day.   The
snow had not frozen and was still  soft.  I  followed  way  trail  and  snow
slopes to the snow finger leading to the Red  Ledge,  greatly  enjoying  the
lovely alpine terrain  and  the  high  peaks  all  around.  The  N  face  of
Formidable was front and center,  but  behind  me  Johannesburg,  and  sharp
pointed Mix-up were equally impressive. I gained the ledge with  no  problem
(elev 6400 ft). The snow on the ledge itself was melted back enough  that  I
could thread my way between it and the cliff  edge  on  dirt.  Part  of  the
ledge was completely snow free. About 2/3 of the way a small  gully  had  to
be crossed on exposed snow.   Remember this gully. (There is  a  picture  of
this gully on page 86 of Washington\'s Highest Mountains.) It  gave  me  some
concern, but I carefully kicked steps across and continued  to  the  end  of
the ledge.

Once across the ledge, the route traversed downward  across  more  beautiful
alpine terrain to pass beneath another rock rib (elev 6200 ft) on the  ridge
between Arts Knoll and Spider Mtn. Finally I was able to  begin  the  ascent
up the Middle Cascade Glacier to the Spider-Formidable Col.  I  stayed  high
on the glacier where no crevasses showed.  Even so I  was  nervous  in  this
section.  This is a  real  glacier  with  an  impressive  icefall  and  many
crevasses on its lower reaches. Snow conditions varied  from  calf  deep  to
breakable crust to crust to crampons being  useful  near  the  very  top.  I
reached the left-hand of the twin cols, elev 7350, at 8:50  (1600  ft,  2:50
hrs).

From the col, I descended on the S side some 200 ft on snow, which was  soft
and getting softer in the warm sun, and began  a  long  tiring  traverse  SW
breaking trail through calf deep or deeper slush.  I  could  still  see  old
boot tracks, which were covered by small avalanches that had  recently  come
off the rock cliffs above in many areas. These tracks were  actually  headed
for Yang Yang Lakes and presumably the Ptarmigan Traverse (on which route  I
had been up to now), and soon  they  and  I  parted  company  as  they  went
downhill to the left and I uphill to the right to the 7000 ft notch on a  SW
trending spur ridge.

Another 200 foot descent down steep snow  on  the  NW  side  of  the  notch,
another traverse across slushy snow then up to cross another  rocky  rib  on
ledges at 7400 ft and I finally reached the so-called "snow patch" (hard  to
tell as it was all snow) below Formidable\'s S face. I climbed this slope  to
the left hand edge where a steep unpleasant looking gully  led  up.  It  was
all snow to 7900 ft. The exit onto rock was unstable snow and wet  and  gave
some trouble, but I knew I was on the right route as  I  passed  two  rappel
slings attached to old pitons. The final rock scramble, with  a  snow  patch
here and there thrown in, was more difficult  than  I  expected,  but  maybe
that was because  I  was  feeling  vulnerable,  overextended  and  a  little
freaked out.  Nevertheless, at 12:50 I emerged onto  the  summit  (3300  ft,
6:50 hrs).

There was a nice metal register on top but it was filled  with  only  scraps
of paper. I was able to piece out a few  recognizable  names.  The  earliest
entry I found was Don Goodman on 8/11/90 (he climbed it again  on  7/31/04).
Paul  Michelson  was  on  8/7/94.  and  Mike  Torok  7/95   (the   day   was
indecipherable). The last entry was 8/21/04. I added  a  waterproof  booklet
to give some order to future entries.

I enjoyed the views of countless peaks in all directions for  half  an  hour
before heading down. I downclimbed very slowly and carefully,  testing  each
hand and foothold. There was a lot of loose rock and  the  terrain  did  not
seem friendly to me. In the gully I began a  series  of  4-5  short  rappels
(Underestimating the difficulties of this  section  I  had  only  brought  a
short 60 ft rope. I wished I had brought a longer one) to get  me  past  the
worst of the wet rock and unstable snow until I could plunge step  down  the
rest of the gully. By now the snow was really slushy, I was sinking in  knee
deep and setting off small surface sluffs.   I  reversed  my  route  to  the
Spider-Formidable Col without incidence but the way seemed  all  uphill  and
the added trail breaking was exhausting. From the col it was downhill  until
at the base of the glacier then more uphill. I rested at  a  creek  to  fill
up.  I had run out of water.  I  had  found  none  once  I  started  up  the
glacier.  It was all under snow.

And then I came to the Red Ledge.  I  hesitate  to  describe  what  happened
next.  For one thing, I am embarrassed - no one likes to admit they blew  it
and who wants to be known as the climber who fell off  the  Red  Ledge.  For
another I don\'t want to feed those finger-wagging critics of  solo  climbers
who love to say I told you so and that solo climbing is crazy and not  safe.
Be that as it may, what happened, happened and there is no sense hiding  it.
 Of course, having companions along does not prevent accidents per  se.   It
only mitigates the consequences of the accident after it happens,  which  is
of course very important. (As an aside,  my  worse  accident  ever,  when  I
broke my leg by sliding 400 feet  down  an  icy  snowslope  and  catching  a
crampon, occurred with a companion along.  In fact  the  companion  was  the
cause of the fall. And I was the one with the cell phone.  I called 911  and
directed my own rescue from my end, so my companion, who was not  hurt,  was
of little use. This really proves nothing but it does  show  that  having  a
companion along is not always helpful and in fact can be detrimental.)

Back to the Red Ledge. I was crossing  the  gully  mentioned  earlier.   The
snow was very slushy and rotten by now.  The  traverse  was  slightly  down.
Kicking steps on a downward traverse is  always  awkward.  For  sure  I  was
tired and perhaps my concentration lapsed. In any  event  I  kicked  a  step
down, went to put weight on it, it broke out, my ice axe pulled through  the
slush and down I went. This was not a place you would want  to  fall.  Below
me the steep narrow mostly snow filled gully plunged  over  100  ft  through
the cliff to open snow slopes below.  I  distinctly  recall  thinking  as  I
fell, "So this is it! Damn!" I fully expected to fall  the  full  length  of
the gully, bouncing off the rock walls on the way down only to be  spit  out
onto the snow at the bottom. Instead, I rocketed  down  some  snow,  over  a
bare rock step, down some more snow and  to  my  astonishment  ended  wedged
upright in a moat some 30-40 feet down, my feet dangling  over  a  hole,  my
left shoulder taking the impact of the landing as  it  crashed  against  the
rock wall with a thud.

I was stunned.  Stunned that I had  fallen,  stunned  that  I  had  stopped,
stunned that I was conscious, stunned that I was  alive  and,  well,  I  was
just plain stunned. I took a few moments to collect myself  and  assess  the
damage. My left shoulder and arm hurt, but they seemed to  work  O.K.  There
were no broken bones or gushing blood.  Everything else seemed  to  be  O.K.
as well. In fact I was remarkably unhurt considering the  fall  I  had  just
taken. The next order of business was to get myself out of  my  predicament.
There was a ledge off to the left just  down  from  where  I  landed,  so  I
extricated myself from the moat and over to that  ledge.  Looking  over  the
situation, it seemed preferable to continue down the gully rather  than  try
to climb back up to the Red Ledge.  Again I wished I had a longer rope,  but
I was thankful I had any rope at all. I set up a rappel using a sling  on  a
bollard on the snow edge of the moat. This got me  to  where  I  could  kick
steps down facing in and reach the snow slope below (Both my ice axe and  my
pole axe were still in my hands when I landed. I hadn\'t lost either).

Shaken, but not quite aware of what  had  just  happened  (the  full  impact
would come later), I thought about the  irony  of  making  it  up  and  down
Formidable only to fall off the Red Ledge. Yes, Mr. Coyote certainly  played
a trick on me. I thankfully made it back to camp at 7:30 (8 miles, 4500  ft,
13:30 hrs). I immediately  iced  (snowed)  my  shoulder  and  later  applied
BioFreeze (I usually carry some for my aching back), which seemed  to  help.
I had a good dinner then went to bed and slept the sleep of the reprieved.

I felt pretty good the next morning, better than I expected.  But  I  wasn\'t
about to let my guard down. I still had to cross the  snowslopes  on  Mix-up
Arm back to Cascade Pass, many of which  have  runouts  over  cliffs.  I  am
getting to where I don\'t particularly like snow, especially traverses.  With
rock, what you see it what you get.  Snow is always  different.  It  can  be
rock hard or light as a feather, bottomless slush  or  nicely  consolidated,
and it has the audacity to change throughout the course of a day. And  often
it just won\'t stay put. It has a nasty tendency to move  downhill.   It  can
be tricky slippery shifty stuff.  Of the 5 falls of my climbing  career  all
have been on snow.

I made it to Cascade Pass without further incidence and  on  to  the  TH  by
1:00 (6.5 miles, 950 ft, 4:30 hr). I stopped by the Marblemount RS to  check
out and chatted with the rangers. I even met  Kelly  Bush,  who  coordinates
rescues for the Park. I was surprised that she knew who I was.  I  guess  my
name has popped up often enough over the years that  she  recognized  it.  I
was reassured when they told me they take the climbing  sign-in  sheet  very
seriously and comforted by their expertise. But I did tell  her  I  hoped  I
never needed her help.

Did this incident scare me? You better believe it  did.   Will  it  stop  me
from climbing solo? Not likely.  I love climbing too much and going solo  is
often the  only  way  I  can  get  out.  But  it  will  probably  change  my
perspective, make me even more careful (never, never let your  guard  down),
and cause me to seek out companions with a  little  more  zeal,  although  I
have always been open to going  out  with  others  if  their  schedules  and
objectives meshed with mine. I may take it easy for while, then again I  may
not. I am now licking my wounds, reflecting on  what  could  have  been  and
thanking the mountain gods for allowing me to climb another day.

Total: 21 miles and 8850 ft in 3 days

Mesahchie Pk (8795 ft) and Katsuk Pk (8680+ ft) - Mt Logan and Mt Arriva
Quads

June 30 - July 2, 2005

I had never been to Easy Pass or the Fisher Cr valley before,  and  what  an
enchanting area this is. Well worth a trip  in  itself.  Starting  from  the
Easy Pass TH (elev 3700 ft) off the North Cascades Highway, I hiked the  3.5
miles to the 6500 ft pass (2800 ft, 2:30 hrs) in ever increasing  loveliness
of meadows and views. From the pass  rugged  mountains  were  in  sight  all
around, Fisher Pk, Mt Arriva, Mt Goode  and  dead  center  the  bulk  of  Mt
Logan. Off to the right I could see Mesahchie and the route from the  valley
floor I would take to my high camp in the 6600 ft snow basin S of the  peak.
It didn\'t look too bad. But first I had to descend a heartbreaking  1500  ft
and 3 miles to Fisher Cr. This descent was  more  than  compensated  by  the
gorgeous flower meadows and the fields of lupine,  penstemon  and  valerian.
Absolutely stunning.

After wandering about a mile through the meadows, I left the trail  at  5000
ft and headed uphill along the edge of a timber  spur.  Although  the  going
was not that difficult, there was some brush to start and, in retrospect,  I
believe it would have been better to head uphill sooner in meadows and  then
traverse leftward to the W in open terrain above the brush. I worked my  way
up steep hillside, avoiding cliffy  areas,  heading  slightly  to  the  left
until I could follow alongside the outlet creek to the basin.  Here I  found
a delightful campsite nestled in the  rocks  with  a  fabulous  view  of  Mt
Arriva (7.5 miles, 4500 ft, 5:40 hrs).

I was awakened during the night to the sound of rain  that  seemed  to  last
about an hour, but the next day dawned mostly blue skies and sunny.  I  left
camp at 6:30 and made my way up easy terrain to the ridge above Pt  7430.  I
avoided what little snow  there  was,  which  was  rock  hard,  as  much  as
possible.  The ridge was guarded by a long vertical cornice for most of  its
length, but I was able to gain access at the far N end by  crawling  between
snow and rock.  Once on the ridge, I followed it easily until  it  began  to
steepen below Katsuk\'s E peak. I scrambled up another  couple  hundred  feet
until confronted by a headwall. Here I worked  my  way  left  a  short  ways
until I could began a rightward traverse  at  8200  ft  on  a  narrow  ledge
around a corner to the dreaded downsloping boilerplate slabs.

Mindful of my mishap of last week, I was moving  carefully  and  cautiously,
and up to this point I had been doing okay, although it will take  me  while
to move again with my previous level of  confidence.  But  I  did  not  like
these slabs. Normally, if I have good hand and  foot  holds,  exposure  does
not bother me that much. However, if the  holds  become  tenuous,  I  become
very nervous, even if over just a 10-foot drop. These  slabs  were  above  a
steep snowslope that funneled into a gully that  plunged  down  hundreds  of
feet. And of course on slabs you rely mostly on  foot  friction,  there  are
few handholds. I kept visualizing my feet slipping out from under me and  me
careening  downhill,  not  a  good  vision  to  have  psychologically.   The
frightening thing about having taken  a  fall  is  that  now  you  know  how
quickly and without warning it can  happen  and  that  once  you  lose  your
balance and start to slide you are gone unless luck intervenes.  No,  I  did
not like these slabs, but I did  make  it  across,  slowly  and  cautiously,
picking my line with great care.

I crossed a rib and another set of slabs, not as bad as the first ones,  and
came to the 8200 ft Katsuk-Mesahchie Col. I contoured left (N) a very  short
ways, scrambled up a slot, across a minor rib and entered the  long  winding
summit gully. The gully was  completely  snow  free  except  for  one  small
patch, easily avoided. I  thoroughly  enjoyed  climbing  up  this  gully.  I
exited to the left near the top, then tiptoed along  the  exposed  ridge  to
the summit (2300 ft,  3:30  hrs).  The  official  Mountaineer  register  was
placed by Mike Torok on 7/29/94. Other entries: Don Beavon -  9/23/00,  Paul
Klenke - 8/12/01, Paul Cho and Mark Owen (1 hr from Katsuk!  Impressive!  It
would take me 2:30 hrs) - 9/21/03, Mike Collins and Jim Brisbine -  8/21/04.
I thought I had seen relatively recent footprints  here  and  there  in  the
dirt along the route, and sure enough there was an entry  for  6/20/05,  the
only one for this year.

I spent a pleasant 30 minutes on the sunny summit, then started for  Katsuk.
I downclimbed the gully,  traversed  the  first  slabs,  but  couldn\'t  face
another trip across the main slabs. I  spotted  a  more  appealing  (to  me)
feasible route below the snow slope below the slabs then up  a  broken  face
back to the traverse ledge. This was steeper but the holds were good  and  I
was more comfortable on it. Once back to the start  of  the  traverse  below
Katsuk\'s E peak, I continued traversing W  around  an  airy  corner  and  on
ledges to cross a series  of  gullies  and  ribs  to  a  broad  gully  below
Katsuk\'s E ridge. I climbed up this gully to the ridge and along the  ridge,
where some snow, nicely softened by now, necessitated the  use  of  the  ice
axe for the first time, around and over several pinnacles until  I  came  to
the one farthest W. I thought  this  must  be  the  summit,  but  it  looked
awfully difficult and I couldn\'t see any  rappel  slings  that  I  was  sure
would be needed to get back down. I turned around and  looked  back  to  the
next pinnacle to the E that I had just come down. Maybe  it  was  higher.  I
frequently have  trouble  determining  the  highest  point  on  a  ridge.  I
scrambled back up it and sure enough under an easily missed  cairn  I  found
an aluminum canister engraved with "Roper â68" (3150 ft,  6:30  hr).  I  was
most happy I didn\'t have to climb the western pinnacle.

Inside the canister was the original notebook left by Chris and  John  Roper
on their first ascent of 8/22/68. It was in very good shape  considering  it
was almost 40 years old.  There  were  fewer  entries  than  for  Mesahchie,
despite it being older. I guess Katsuk is climbed  less  often.  There  were
the same names as mentioned for Mesahchie  plus:  Don  Goodman  -  10/10/89,
Grant Meyers - 7/11/91, and Paul Michelson and  Martin  Shetter  -  9/15/91.
The last entry was 8/8/04.

I looked longingly at Kimtah, the next peak  W.  It  didn\'t  look  that  far
away, as the crow flies.  But the ridge between it  and  me  looked  awfully
ragged with numerous intervening gullies. It isn\'t called Ragged  Ridge  for
nothing. It was still early (1:30), but not that  early.  I  wasn\'t  exactly
breaking speed records and I wasn\'t sure I could make  it  up  and  back  to
camp before dark. Also, dark clouds were beginning to gather over Logan  and
Goode.  It could be raining soon. So I decided not to push my  luck  and  to
be satisfied with two peaks. If tomorrow was a good day, I could  still  try
for Kimtah on a lower level traverse from camp.  Otherwise I  could  combine
it on another trip with Cosho, the peak farthest W on the ridge.

I reversed my route along Katsuk\'s E ridge and down the main  gully,  but  I
lost my way across the ribs and side gullies, taking a higher line. I  ended
up at the right spot below Katsuk\'s E peak and started down the S  ridge.  I
thought I was going to make it through this climb  without  using  my  rope,
but once again I lost the line and ended up cliff bound. Rather  than  climb
up and find the proper line, I made 2 rappels to  get  on  track  again.  At
least that justified bringing the rope along.  I ambled the rest of the  way
down in no hurry, soaking in my beautiful surroundings. I think  I  consider
any time I am now allowed in the presence of the mountain gods to be a  gift
and I want to properly appreciate it. I returned to camp at 4:30  (3  miles,
3300 ft, 10 hrs) with plenty of  time  to  relax  and  leisurely  enjoy  the
afternoon.

The expected rain made its appearance sometime  during  the  night.  When  I
awoke at 5:00 the next morning, it was foggy  and  still  raining  steadily.
There would be no climbing Kimtah this day. I rolled over and went  back  to
sleep till 7:00, hoping the rain  would  diminish.  This  it  did  gradually
until by the time I left at 9:00  it  had  mostly  stopped.  The  brush  and
flowers would, however, stay wet the rest of the day, so, in  an  effort  to
keep my feet dry, I pulled the old plastic bag trick.  I  put  produce  bags
from the grocery store on my feet between the  boot  and  sock.  These  bags
weight nothing, take no room and I always carry a couple sets  in  my  ditty
bag. This in conjunction with gaiters and rain pants kept me mostly dry  for
the trip out.

It took 1:30 hours to slip and slide  down  wet  slopes  to  the  trail  and
another 2 hours to climb back up to Easy Pass.  During this time  I  saw  no
one. The sun gradually made a return appearance and the fog began  to  lift.
The high peaks to the S remained obscured but Golden Horn to the N lived  up
to its name as it was briefly highlighted by sunshine. Once at  the  pass  I
began running into the "crowds" coming  in  for  the  holiday  weekend.  The
parking lot was full by the time I reached the TH at 2:30 (7.5  miles,  1600
ft, 5:30 hrs).

I was pleased that on this first solo trip after my  fall  I  have  more  or
less  successfully  faced  my  personal  demons.   And  while  I  have   not
completely put them to rest, I have kept them at bay, at least for a while.

Total: 18 miles and 9500 ft in 3 days

Doughgob Mtn (6172 ft), Chiwaukum Mtns Quad - July 7-8, 2005

Thursday was forecast to be sunny with rain returning on  Friday.   I  would
have one good weather day.  Indecision as to where to  go  and  what  to  do
made for a late start.  I finally decided on these three  Back  Court  peaks
as I hoped things would be better E of the crest or that I could climb  them
even in the rain. My plan was a loop trip from Whitepine Cr to Wildhorse  Cr
to Frosty Pass to Chain Lakes to Icicle Cr and back to  Whitepine,  climbing
the peaks on the way. It looked good on paper, but ended  up  not  being  so
great in execution due to the condition of the upper Whitepine trail. I  had
no idea this trail was in such bad shape.

I began from the Whitepine TH (elev 2800 ft), off Highway  2  E  of  Stevens
Pass. At 2.5 miles I turned onto the Wildhorse trail  and  followed  it  6.6
miles to 5800 ft Frosty Pass. From here a rough trail (shown on GT  but  not
on USGS map) goes another 3 miles to Doelle Lakes. I was  making  good  time
with a light pack, enjoying the warm sunny day and the lovely meadows  below
Big Chiwaukum, Snowgrass and Frosty Mtn. I was also  idly  wondering  why  I
hadn\'t run into any bugs yet this season, when I entered  the  large  marshy
basin S of Doughgob and the hordes descended upon me en masse. I was  forced
to cover up head to toe to escape their voracious appetites.   So  much  for
no bugs this season.

In the basin I dropped my pack for the 1 hr, 700 ft RT up Doughgob.  (As  an
aside, is this the proper spelling or it is  a  misprint?   The  Back  Court
lists it as Doughgob, but the creek for which  it  is  presumably  named  is
Doughgod.)  It was now 8:00 and I was running out of daylight.  I  continued
past lovely Doelle lakes, over the 6200 ft pass on  Bulls  Tooth  ridge  and
down to 5700 Chain Lakes on the other side where I found  a  campsite  on  a
knoll between two of the lakes at 9:20 (14.5 miles, 6050 ft, 9 hrs) where  I
had just enough time to set up my tent before dark.

I fully expected it to rain during  the  night,  but  by  morning  it  still
hadn\'t started and visibility was reasonable.  What luck.  It  would  be  so
much more pleasant climbing Bulls Tooth without  rain.  I  made  the  RT  to
Bulls Tooth in 2 hrs (1200 ft). The hardest  part  was  getting  around  the
lake on large talus. The highest point, to the  E  of  the  6807  ft  summit
marked on maps, had a Mountaineer register placed by Johnny Jeans  in  2001.
There were only 4 or 5 other entries since then.  I was surprised it  wasn\'t
climbed more often.  Perhaps most people go to the 6807 ft summit.

By the time I was packed and  ready  to  leave  my  camp  it  was  drizzling
lightly. At the last lake where the trail starts downhill,  I  left  it  for
the saddle to the N and, carrying my full pack, easily climbed the  ridge  W
to the summit of Lemool. The actual high point was  buried  in  thick  scrub
trees but a cairn was a few feet away in the open.  Here I left  a  register
(I also left one on Doughgob.)  Right by the cairn I found  a  pair  of  red
gloves, which I packed out.

From Lemool, I headed directly S downhill to intersect the trail once  again
and followed it down 2.5 miles to the Icicle Cr Trail (elev 3800  ft).  This
trail I then followed uphill 2.5 miles to the Whitepine Trail  junction  and
over the saddle (elev 4600) into the  Whitepine  drainage.  It  was  raining
steadily by now, and would continue to do so for the rest of the day, but  I
figured it was all downhill from now on and all on trail so I had  it  made.
Ha! My first inkling that all was not well was when I almost lost the  trail
in the marshy meadows of the saddle. From there  things  just  deteriorated.
This is an absolutely horrid trail. Oh the tread is still there, but  it  is
so brushed over you often can\'t see  it  as  your  feet  feel  for  the  way
through the waist high foliage of meadows or the even worse  over  the  head
high brush of the alder thickets. This went on for an  endless  4  miles  or
so. It rivaled the worst  climber  trails  I  have  been  on,  such  as  the
Bachelor Cr Trail. I was not expecting this. And  it  was  WET!  Under  such
conditions, there is no way to stay dry no matter what you wear (although  a
drysuit might work).  I gave up and embraced the  wetness  as  part  of  the
experience. Whatever you do, do not take this "trail" in the rain.

After an interminable amount of oneness with the  wetness,  I  came  to  the
crossing of Whitepine Cr. Earlier in the season  this  can  be  a  difficult
crossing but now it was low. A  few  spindly  logs  had  been  placed  as  a
makeshift bridge. I used them but I could just as  well  have  waded  across
clothes and all.  I couldn\'t have gotten any wetter. Just on the other  side
was the Wildhorse Trail junction and the closing of my loop.  The  last  2.5
miles to the TH seemed like a super highway compared to what I just been  on
(14.5 miles, 2150 ft, 8 hrs - plus 1 mile, 1200 ft, 2 hrs for Bulls Tooth).

Total: 30 miles, 9400 ft in 2 days

My original plan was to go with a group to climb Redoubt and the Mox  Peaks,
and then stay an extra 2 or 3 days to climb Spickard, Custer and Rahm.  When
the group cancelled due to forecast  rain  on  Saturday,  I  decided  to  go
anyway and at least get the 3 peaks I could do on my own.  I  was  a  little
nervous about going into such a rugged remote area alone, but I vowed to  be
extra careful and not do anything stupid.

Thursday - I left town at 2:30  pm  and  stopped  in  Sedro  Woolley  for  a
permit. Although permits are not strictly  necessary,  I  mainly  wanted  to
sign the climber\'s register. The more people who know where I am  going  and
what my plans are when I am solo, the better. Once in Canada,  I  drove  the
Chilliwack Lake Road to the last official  campground  (Riverside)  where  I
spent the night in my Cherokee. The grizzled campground host,  who  accepted
my $10 US in lieu of Canadian, couldn\'t understand why I was camping  alone.
"No fun in that," he replied. When I mentioned the  peaks  I  was  going  to
climb, he had never heard of them.

Friday - I managed to find my way the short remaining distance to the  Depot
Cr TH, despite having several differing directions as to how to  get  there.
From the  end  of  the  paved  road  at  the  entrance  to  Chilliwack  Lake
Provincial Park, it was 6.4 miles on  a  very  potholed  dirt  road  to  the
unmarked Depot Cr road on the left. This road is very  rough  and  overgrown
and can now only be driven 1.7 miles to a large washout. A normal car  might
make it with care .9 miles to a parking  area,  but  from  then  on  a  high
clearance 4-wheel drive is required. One car was parked at .9  miles  and  2
trucks at the end.  I would have company.

I shouldered my heavy pack and  started  walking  the  road  at  8:30  under
overcast skies. The forecast was for showers tonight  and  tomorrow  morning
with clearing by afternoon. I hoped to complete my itinerary in 4  days  but
I carried food for 5 in case I lost a day to bad  weather.  After  about  10
minutes walking, the "road" turned steeply uphill to a T, then took a  right
to become level, muddy and even more overgrown. Here I  met  a  Park  Ranger
and  helper  coming  out.   They  were  part  of  a  5-person  team   making
measurements on the Silver Lake Glacier. I would meet  the  other  3  later.
When I told the ranger I was planning on climbing Spickard solo, I got  that
disapproving look and she proceeded  to  inform  me  that  the  Silver  Lake
Glacier had crevasses. When I told here I wasn\'t  climbing  up  the  glacier
but up the S side, she looked puzzled, as if  she  wasn\'t  aware  there  was
another route up the mountain.

In about an hour I reached the International Monument and  the  registration
book for entering the North Cascades National Park. In the book it  said  it
was okay if you didn\'t have a permit for the Park but they  wanted  everyone
to register to gage usage. One other party of 4  was  currently  registered.
Only about 5 climbing parties had registered for 2005 so far. Several  other
parties had gone only as far as the falls. From the  monument,  the  "trail"
wound its way up and down through lovely  mossy  old  growth  forest,  often
close to Depot Cr.   Many  logs  were  across  the  trail  and  several  bad
windfalls. Progress was slow. After a couple of miles, the  trail  began  to
climb and it began to drizzle. Darn, the system was coming in sooner than  I
expected. I stopped to put on rain gear,  mostly  because  of  the  now  wet
brush.  Then I met the other 3 rangers coming out. Once  again  I  got  that
disapproving look when I told the guy in charge I was going in solo, but  to
his credit he didn\'t give me  a  lecture  and  only  told  me  to  be  safe.
However, he did ask if I had a permit and seemed genuinely surprised when  I
told him I had gotten one in Sedro Woolley. He also told me the party  of  4
planned to climb Spickard on Saturday, weather permitting.

After 3:45 hrs I came to the foot of the famed Depot  Cr  Falls.  Impressive
doesn\'t begin to describe these  beautiful  falls.  Not  free  falling,  but
rather cascading down a thousand feet of slabs and ledges, these  falls  are
truly spectacular. After a spray covered wet  step,  helped  by  a  handline
left in place, the way continued  up  the  very  edge  of  the  falls,  past
another lesser muddy step with a second handline and  up  alternating  talus
and boot track in the woods. Sparse cairns  and  flags  helped  keep  me  on
route on this very steep section. Farther up the way edged the falls  again.
You could almost reach out and touch them. At the top Depot Cr was  squeezed
into a slot and shot out from the rim in free falling splendor.

At 5 hrs I topped out into level upper Depot Cr valley at a  nice  campsite.
The way followed the extreme left hand edge of the valley until  reaching  a
vast open washout of boulders from the creek. I picked my way slowly up  the
valley. The showers were coming and going and  things  were  getting  pretty
wet.  I was beginning to think I might have to stop at Ouzel Lake to set  up
camp if the weather continued to deteriorate, although I  really  wanted  to
locate at the highest point on the benches  below  Spickard  where  I  could
access all my peaks, some 1200 feet above the lake. After  another  hour  or
so, the rain let up and visibility was good although the high  summits  were
in fog. I was above Ouzel Lake and I could see that it would be  out  of  my
way to drop down to it, so I just kept going up toward Silver Lake  Pass.  I
could see the party of 4 camped at the lake. At  4:00  I  found  a  pleasant
campsite at 6800 ft on a heather bench just below the talus  fields  on  the
SW slope of Spickard (6.5 miles, 4400 ft, 7:30 hr). This would  be  my  home
for at least the next 3 nights. I set up camp and found water (about 200  ft
below me) before the rain started in earnest.

Saturday - It rained steadily all night long and was raining  still  in  the
morning. I killed time eating, sleeping and reading.   Good  thing  my  book
was a page-turner or I would have really been bored. Somewhere around  11:00
am I could tell the rain was letting up and I prepared to  give  Spickard  a
go, starting out at noon. I was a little premature in my assessment  of  the
weather\'s improvement  as  it  was  very  foggy  and  a  few  showers  still
lingered, but I was getting desperate.  I am  not  good  at  hanging  around
camp doing nothing.

From camp, I headed up talus toward the  pocket  glacier  on  Spickard\'s  SW
slope. Momentary clearing gave me my bearings. I hugged the right hand  edge
of the snowfield to avoid bare ice that  was  beginning  to  appear  in  the
center. Even so, the snow was a little icy and I donned crampons.  I  easily
climbed the snow and a short cruddy class 3 rock  section  to  the  8000  ft
notch in the SW ridge, descended the other side onto snow and  traversed  to
a gully that crossed to the open SE slopes. Easy snow led  up,  but  in  the
fog I gained the S ridge too soon, at  about  8600  ft,  and  had  to  cross
several gullies and follow the rocky  ridge  up  and  down  over  two  false
summits before making the top (2300 ft, 3:30  hrs).   By  now  it  had  quit
raining and the sun was even beginning to make an appearance.   I  had  nice
views of Silver Lake, Silver Lake Glacier, Custer and Rahm to the N but  the
S was still completely enveloped in fog. A Mountaineer register was  on  the
summit, placed by Bill Maxwell in  1983,  but  inexplicably  a  Park  Ranger
entry in 1993 noted that he had cut out  all  the  used  pages  up  to  that
point, some dozen pages. Why  on  earth  would  a  ranger  do  something  so
stupid? What was the purpose?   Not  only  did  that  destroy  the  historic
record, it deprived climbers of the joy of reading the entries and  lessened
the space to add new entries (normally the front of  the  pages  are  filled
first then the back of the pages), as the remaining pages were almost  full.
I know that many in the Park Service for some reason,  which  I  have  never
understood, do not like summit  registers  and  often  remove  them  but  to
mutilate one is completely beyond my comprehension.

I had enough visibility on the way down to find a  gully  that  went  almost
directly off the  summit  to  the  snow  slopes  below  from  where  I  then
traversed back to my uphill route.  I was back in camp  by  6:00  (2  miles,
2500 ft, 6 hrs RT) but also back in the fog. My hoped for  evening  sunshine
did not materialize.

Sunday - This day I awoke to clear blue skies and sunshine  and  a  stunning
view of Mt Redoubt shining  in  the  morning  light  across  Depot  Cr.  The
weather forecast was right. I started  at  7:30  for  Custer  and  Rahm  and
reached the 7400 ft Silver Lake Pass, which is more like a  vast  undulating
talus field than a definite pass, in 45 minutes. Deciding  to  climb  Custer
first, I dropped slightly, traversed some slabs and a snowfield to gain  the
gentle SE slopes. The step off the snow onto rock at the  far  side  of  the
snowfield was a tricky wet class 4 move that gave me some  difficulty.  Once
across it was easy to gain Custer\'s S ridge just N of  Pt  8385.  The  ridge
looked frightful but for the most part was easier than it looked.  I  stayed
on the very crest.  It was quite exposed but not difficult until I  came  to
the  last  pinnacle  before  the  low  point  in  the  ridge.  Here  a  most
unpleasant, exposed loose class 3 downclimb on the E side slowed me up as  I
carefully picked my way down. A little more on the crest and I came  to  the
last easy but very loose scree slopes leading to the summit at  11:15  (2100
ft, 3:45 hrs). I could find no register  so  I  left  the  only  one  I  had
brought.

I reversed the S ridge (the unpleasant downclimb was  much  easier  climbing
up) to the point I had gained it, then descended the rib SE  until  I  could
drop onto the plateau leading to Rahm. A long traverse of an hour  at  about
7600 ft across mostly talus but some snow ended at a cliff band and  a  deep
gully draining the snowfield above. Before the  deep  gully  was  a  shallow
snowfree gully that looked like it would go to the top of the cliffs.  There
was a short 5-foot step about half way up this 200 ft gully that gave  me  a
little trouble. I surmounted it by climbing without my pack and  pulling  it
up after on a rope. Once past that it was clear sailing to  the  snow  basin
above.  A large cairn marked the top of this gully. I followed snow as  high
as possible then more loose talus and scree to  the  top  of  Rahm  at  3:40
(3400 ft, 8:10 hrs). Here I found an intact register placed by  Chris  Weber
and Mike Torok in 1995. An entry  for  4/29/04  by  Lowell  and  Carl  Skoog
caught my eye.  They skied from Depot Cr.  Can you imagine carrying skis  up
that trail? Those are two tough brothers. Other entries  I  recognized  were
Grant Meyers and  Don  Beavon  in  2000,  Paul  Klenke  in  2003,  and  Paul
Michelson in 2004.

I lounged in the sun for a while, taking in the views on this  perfect  day.
In the gully I rappelled the step, although it took me a  while  to  find  a
solid anchor. I took a low route back to Silver Lake  Pass,  dropping  to  a
lowpoint of 7100 ft and  traversing  over  endless  loose  awful  talus  and
scree. I dragged into camp at 7:15 (7 miles, 3900 ft, 11:45  hrs).  My  tent
was in full sun and it was sweltering. No shade was in sight. Now  I  wished
I were camped at the lake so I could jump in and cool off.   I  didn\'t  even
have a stream nearby to wash up in. How quickly  conditions  change  in  the
mountains.  I stripped in my tent and waited for the sun to go down and  for
it to cool off.


Monday - I slept in, then took my time getting  ready  to  leave.  I  looked
longingly over at Mt Redoubt.  What a beautiful mountain! It  was  so  close
and conditions were perfect and yet it was completely out of  reach  for  me
alone. I left reluctantly, but with the knowledge that  I  would  return  to
this lovely area.


I went out slowly and carefully. It would never do to blow  it  on  the  way
out on the treacherous  talus  and  trail  after  successfully  climbing  my
peaks. The party of 4 was no longer at the lake.  I  was  completely  alone.
The falls and all the creeks were noticeably higher on this hot  sunny  day.
Once down in the forest, I stopped by the raging creek to wash up  and  cool
off. At the monument and Park register the party of 4 made a note that  they
were rained out of Mt Spickard, but presumably made it up  Redoubt  and  the
Mox peaks, their stated goals. I reached the car at  4:30  (7  hrs),  taking
almost as much time going out as coming in. But I was tired, took  more  and
longer rests and that counts my stop to take a dip in the creek.

Total: 22 miles and 11, 500 ft in 4 days.

Mt Chaval (7127 ft) and Pk 6400 - Prairie Mtn, Huckleberry Mtn & Snowking
Mtn Quads - July 22-24, 2005


I met Dale, Mike T, John and Deb at the Darrington  RS  at  9:10  on  Friday
morning with it raining steadily all the way from  Seattle.  This  rain  was
not forecast and was unexpected. Since our approach was  crosscountry  on  a
way trail and through brush, none of us  were  anxious  to  head  out  right
away. The updated forecast at the RS indicated clearing by afternoon  so  we
decided to wait for a few hours to see  what  would  happen.  After  killing
time till 12:30 in the local  restaurant,  entertained  by  John\'s  humorous
tales of the inner workings of Mountain Rescue, the rain  did  indeed  stop,
and we decided to go, knowing full well we would encounter wet brush on  the
way in.

We drove Grade Cr Road 2640, off the Suiattle River Road, 4.8 miles  to  the
junction with spur 2643. Here Dale left  his  car  and  we  all  piled  into
Mike\'s truck and my Cherokee for a further 1.2 miles to 2700 ft.  This  spur
has deep waterbars that require a high clearance 4X4; in fact I barely  made
it across one of them.  We started walking up the remaining .7 mile  of  the
road at 2:30. At the 3100 ft switchback we left the road  and  picked  up  a
rough way trail which we soon lost as it descended to  cross  a  gully  with
many huge downed trees. We proceeded to wander around in awful  terrain  for
the next hour traversing to a second gully before finding the trail again  a
hundred feet or so below us. It is essential to stay on  the  way  trail  to
avoid unpleasant brush. Stay low and look for flags after the  first  gully.
The way trail, although rough with numerous ups and downs, has had a lot  of
work done by someone cutting out  many  of  the  logs.  It  traverses  steep
hillside, crosses a small talus field and two creeks then  climbs  to  cross
Jug Cr in a marshy meadow.  From here on the trail is very faint but  it  is
no longer essential to stay on it as it follows the creek to Bluff Lake.  We
found a campsite for our 3 tents on the N side of the 4200 ft lake  at  7:20
(3 miles, 2000 ft, 5 hrs). This is lower than we had originally  planned  on
getting but we were happy to get that far  considering  our  delayed  start.
Mike built a campfire that served the dual purpose  of  drying  us  out  and
keeping the bugs away.

The next morning at 7:50 we headed N from the E end of Bluff Lake then E  to
follow a creek toward Cliff Lake. The day began  with  fog  and  clouds  but
gradually cleared to extensive views.  An open hillside above the  lake  led
N then E again to the lovely basin SW of Pk 6400. Here we  made  a  tactical
error and ended up too high and unable to cross the S ridge of Pk  6400.  We
had to descend to 5600 ft to find an easy place  to  cross  into  the  rocky
basin SE of Pk 6400. A steep heather gully on the  other  side  led  to  the
5960 pass SE of Pt 6356. From here we dropped down a ledge onto a  permanent
snowfield (oddly not shown on the map), where a short section  of  bare  ice
on the snowfield caused me to  put  on  crampons.  They  were  not  strictly
necessary and the others got across without them but my recent fall made  me
nervous. From the end of the snow, pleasant scrambling up slabs  put  us  at
the base of Chaval\'s W face. A short class 3 step  and  steep  heather  gave
access to the very obvious large ramp slanting  left  to  right  across  the
face. This ramp is easier then it appears. At the top of the ramp it  was  a
short distance on the S ridge to the summit at 2:30 (3750 ft, 6:40 hrs).

The register was placed in 2001 by Johnny Jeans. Chaval doesn\'t seem  to  be
climbed all that often, with only 2 or 3 ascents a  year.  I  recognized  no
other names entered. Dale, Deb and John soon headed down while  Mike  and  I
stayed longer enjoying  the  views.  Mike  proceeded  to  identify  all  the
surrounding peaks and reminisce about a few of his many trips in  the  area.
It is fun being out with someone so knowledgeable. By the time  we  left  at
3:15, the others were down the ramp.

We were all back to the 5960 ft pass by 4:20. There Mike and  I  decided  to
take off and try for the "bonus" Peak 6400. It is a very impressive  looking
rock spire from Chaval. We reached the base of the rock at  the  deep  notch
to the E in an hour but the rock looked  too  difficult  and  would  require
some pro to lead. All we had was a 120 ft rope and some slings.  We  circled
around the base of the rock to the W looking for a  scramble  route  up  and
were just about to give up when a steep  gully  directly  below  the  summit
offered a possibility. I led up, encouraged by Mike, to a ledge at  midface.
Then Mike took over up a chimney and rib the rest of the  way  to  the  top.
The whole thing turned out to be more difficult than we had expected,  about
my limit of comfort for unroped climbing (high class 4  or  maybe  very  low
class 5) but did provide added interest to the day. We reached  the  top  at
6:00 where I left one of my small registers.

To get down we rappelled directly to the E notch. We  found  an  old  rappel
sling on a shallow horn, which Mike replaced with a  new  one.  We  couldn\'t
see if the rope reached all the way down. I went first and  soon  discovered
our 120 ft rope was about 10 feet short of the notch. I secured myself on  a
ledge while Mike lengthened the system with another sling so the  rope  just
barely allowed me to reach the notch. We were both off  the  rock  by  7:00,
after which we zipped back to camp at 8:00 (6 miles, 4700  ft,  12:10  hrs).
We had a quick dinner as the voracious bugs soon drove us to our tents.

We made it out the next morning in 3.5 hours.  We found where  we  had  lost
the way in the first two gullies. It was  so  much  easier  staying  on  the
trail, although the first gully is still a bit of a pain.

Total: 12 miles and 7150 ft in 3 days

Boston Pk (8894 ft - Cascade Pass Quad) - July 27-28, 2005


What a surprise this peak turned out to be! The first surprise  was  that  I
was actually able to solo it.  The second surprise was that it was really  a
very pleasant climb. Boston Pk has a reputation  for  horrible  loose  rock.
Few climbers have anything nice to say about it or express a  desire  for  a
repeat ascent. The TR by Jim Brisbine of his and Mike C\'s ascent in July  of
2004 did little to dispel that impression.  Theirs  was  a  desperate  climb
done in terrible conditions  of  fresh  snow,  wet  unprotectable  rock  and
limited visibility.  Mine was in perfect conditions  where  I  was  able  to
find  a  reasonable  route  of  fairly  solid  rock.  That  makes  all   the
difference.

However, I didn\'t know what the outcome  would  be  when  I  started  making
plans. Boston has been on my wish list for years,  way  before  I  began  my
quest for the 100  Highest.  Its  reputation  and  fearsome  appearance  has
always prevented me from giving it a try. Now the time seemed right.  Still,
I worried that maybe I was crazy for even considering soloing it. There  was
only one way to find out.  I  was  mentally  prepared  to  give  it  a  good
attempt, but I was also prepared to back off at the slightest real  problem.
I took a 50m rope, a light alpine rack, 2 ice axes (for an anticipated  hard
moat crossing) and crampons. (All I needed was the rope and one ice axe.)  I
would also allow 3 days, so I had one full day for the climb.  I  do  better
on technical terrain if I have plenty of time and don\'t feel rushed.

When getting my permit to camp at Sahale Glacier Camp,  I  learned  a  youth
(13-year old boys) group of 12 would also be camped there.  Just my luck.  I
have camped often enough near youth groups to know what to expect.  Teenaged
boys do not know how to be quiet and melt into the background. Sure  enough,
I caught up to the raucous group at Cascade Pass.  Not wanting to  be  stuck
behind them, I continued on, without  stopping  to  rest  at  the  pass,  up
lovely Sahale Arm to Sahale Glacier Camp (6 miles, 4000  ft,  4:20  hrs).  I
had time to set up camp, eat dinner, have a pleasant  chat  with  two  other
small parties camped nearby and enjoy a little tranquility before the  youth
group dragged in a good 2 hours later at 8:00.  Naturally they chose a  spot
barely 200 feet from me. I resigned myself to putting up  with  their  noise
and commotion as I turned in at 8:30. But when I was awakened at about  9:00
by the loud voices of 4 boys not more than 10 feet  from  me  unconcerningly
chatting away, it was more than I could bear. I stuck  my  head  out  of  my
bivy tent and pointed out that I was trying to get some sleep and they  were
invading my personal space. They did apologize.  I really  think  they  were
totally unaware of the inappropriateness of their actions.

I was on my way at 6:00 the next morning before anyone  else  was  stirring.
(That also allowed me private uninterrupted use of the  open-air  composting
toilet). The Sahale Glacier was beginning to show some bare ice but  it  was
easily avoided to the left.  I quickly climbed up the snow to  the  S  ridge
of Sahale and scrambled up to the notch just to the  right  of  the  summit,
crossed the notch and got my first look at Boston. It  looked  as  frightful
as ever but I wasn\'t going to let that  affect  me.  The  ridge  leading  to
Boston was mostly bare. There was only  a  short  section  of  snow  at  the
beginning.  I descended to the Sahale-Boston Col then made my way along  the
ridge. I expected this ridge to be loose, exposed and unpleasant.  In  fact,
I found it rather enjoyable. Custer\'s S ridge, which I  had  recently  done,
is much worse.

I worked my way along the ridge, over the false summit  and  along  a  ledge
(marked by a cairn) to cross onto the upper toe of  the  Boston  Glacier.  A
large bergshrund crossed the entire toe just below me preventing  access  to
the main glacier. No matter. I only needed to cross the very upper  part  to
the SE corner of the summit block. I easily gained access  to  the  rock  (I
left ice axes and crampons here) and scrambled up a few feet to a  prominent
ledge.  This was the loosest section of the  whole  climb.  I  followed  the
ledge NE until it narrowed. Most directions have you continue up  and  right
working your way onto the N ridge some distance  from  the  summit,  but  at
this point I spotted an appealing chimney  up  and  to  the  left.   I  like
chimneys.  I feel secure in chimneys. It was class 4, but the rock was  good
so I scrambled up it. At the top a ramp and broken  rock  continued  up  and
before I knew it I was on the ridge about 100 feet N of the summit. I  could
barely believe my good luck at  choice  of  route.  I  scrambled  the  short
remaining distance to the top (1500 ft, 3:10 hrs).

I spent a glorious half hour on top taking in all the  glorious  surrounding
peaks. The register was a large classy bound book in a  heavy  Mazama  metal
case dating back to 1966. There was plenty of space left, as there  were  on
average only several entries per year. In fact mine was the first for  2005.
Other entries were John and Chris Roper\'s 1968 climb  in  memory  of  Robert
Schneller who died climbing the peak the year before; Paul  Michelson   â87;
Don Goodman \'93; Mike Torok \'96; Paul Klenke \'00; Don Beavon  \'02  and  Mike
Collins and Jim Brisbine \'04.  The most humorous entry was from a poor  lost
soul in â89 who stated he thought he was climbing the W ridge of  Forbidden.
He was really lost, but then he was from California.

I made the 3 standard rappels from the summit back to the  glacier  toe.   I
had a 50m rope with me but from the amount of excess rope at each rappel,  a
shorter rope would have worked.  The rappel anchors  were  probably  put  in
when 120 ft ropes were standard. I took my time retracing the route back  to
Sahale along the ridge. I was back in camp at 12:00 (1800  ft,  6  hrs),  in
plenty of time to go out  this  same  day.  The  trip  out  (3:10  hrs)  was
uneventful, except for the steady stream of tourists  asking  what  my  rope
was for.  It is not  that  I  mind  explaining  to  people,  but  after  the
twentieth time it got a bit tiresome.

Total: 15 miles and 5800 ft in 2 days

After a couple of months of frustrating  weather  related  cancellations  of
trying to get together, I finally  joined  Paul  Michelson  and  his  friend
David for a successful ascent of this peak. It was worth the wait.   What  a
beautiful mountain and area!

Paul and I left early on Sunday, starting  from  the  Eldorado  parking  lot
(elev 2100 ft) at 9:30. David couldn\'t get  away  till  noon  and  would  be
joining us later at high camp. From the parking area a logjam a few  hundred
feet down the road allows  an  easy  crossing  of  the  Cascade  River.  The
climber\'s trail begins on the other side gaining  elevation  steeply  almost
immediately and never letting up. It is definitely a grunt.  After  2000  ft
gain in the woods, the way breaks out into the  open  at  a  boulder  field.
Sparse cairns mark the way, but care is required in  negotiating  the  rocks
and to stay on the best route. Heat and annoying biting flies added  to  the
fun in this section. In another 1000 ft we were at the top of  most  of  the
talus and took a break for lunch at a small waterfall.

Above the waterfall, views of all the Cascade Pass area  peaks  improved  as
we worked our way up into lovely  Eldorado  basin.  Near  the  head  of  the
basin, the route crosses the ridge on the left at about 6100 ft and drops  a
hundred feet into the  Roush  Cr  drainage  at  the  foot  of  the  receding
Eldorado Glacier. More talus and slabs led to the toe of the glacier,  which
we ascended on the extreme right hand side on a well-worn path to  the  high
camp on Eldorado\'s rocky W ridge, elevation 7500 ft (5 miles, 5800 ft,  8:30
hrs). There were several other parties camped here as well, but we  found  a
reasonable site for Paul\'s three-man tent. A strong wind threatened to  turn
the tent into a sail as we struggled to get it  up.  We  had  time  to  find
water, eat dinner and relax while waiting for David to arrive. This  he  did
at 9:30 just as it got really dark and we were beginning to worry.

Sunday was a gorgeous day.  Monday was forecast to rain. We were hoping  the
forecast was wrong.  Unfortunately it was not. We awoke on  Monday  to  zero
visibility and wind and soon after that rain that kept us in  the  tent  all
day. We were not happy campers as we lost an entire day, but at least I  got
caught up on my sleep.

Tuesday dawned cold and clear and we were off at 6:30. We roped  up  on  the
Inspiration Glacier and cramponed on perfect snow one mile to  the  8000  ft
pass NE of Tepeh Towers Pt 8386. A few crevasses were beginning to  open  up
but the way was generally easy and straightforward. From  the  pass  we  had
our first look at Dorado Needle and  it  looked  good.   A  track  even  led
toward it.  Someone else had been up it recently. We  dropped  600  ft  onto
the McAllister Glacier, then climbed back up to the base  of  the  tower  on
the NW ridge (1000 ft, 2 hrs.).

Steep snow led most of the way to the notch on ridge.  A  moat  crossed  the
snow about half way up but was still crossable on a narrow bridge. Paul  put
in a masterful lead on this section, placing two pickets,  while  I  belayed
him with a boot axe belay, and going almost the full length of our main  60m
rope. He commented he could have used a  third  picket  and  a  second  tool
under the very hard snow conditions. I followed up and  was  glad  I  didn\'t
have to lead it. Some front pointing was  necessary  to  the  moat,  then  a
traverse left along the edge of the moat to the bridge and on up where  Paul
had chopped helpful steps. We brought David up on  our  second  thinner  50m
rope.

We stashed crampons and ice axes at  the  notch,  left  the  thin  rope  and
reroped with all three of us on the 60m rope. I took over the lead  for  the
rock. I found the ridge most enjoyable.  There was a little loose  stuff  on
the first pitch but for the most part the rock  was  sound  with  plenty  of
holds and could be mostly protected with  slings  alone.  It  was,  however,
very exposed, especially the two short au  cheval  sections.  Because  there
were three of us on the rope and  to  enhance  communication,  I  broke  the
climb into 3 short pitches, so the rockwork took time. I reached the  summit
at 11:30 (5 hrs).  David came up second, followed by  Paul.  I  looked  hard
but could not find a register. I was so sure a register  would  be  on  this
summit, I didn\'t bring one of my own. Darn!

We down climbed the route back to the notch, with Paul coming last.  We  had
left a few pieces of pro on the chevals to help with the down climb. At  the
notch, we tied the two ropes together for a long  rappel  that  reached  all
the way to the bottom of the steep snow. We were all happy  for  the  second
rope that allowed for this. The snow of the glacier had softened up  by  now
and no longer required crampons. We quickly retraced our route back to  camp
arriving at 3:30 (4 miles, 1700 ft, 9 hrs RT).

Paul and I packed up and left  30  minutes  later.   David  wanted  to  stay
another night and climb Eldorado so we left him the tent. It was  almost  as
much of a grunt going down the knee-busting trail.  At least  it  wasn\'t  as
hot and the bugs weren\'t very bad. Again care  must  be  taken  to  stay  on
route in the boulder field.  It is essential to find the trail  again  where
it enters the woods. We reached the cars at 7:45  (6  miles,  250  ft,  3:45
hrs.)

I still have Klawatti, Austera and Primus to do on the Eldorado Icecap.  Due
to schedules, a day of bad weather and logistics I was not able to  get  any
of these on this trip, but I was elated to climb Dorado Needle and  am  more
than satisfied. And I look forward to returning to this lovely area.

Total: 14 miles and 7750 ft.

Azurite Peak (8400+ ft - Azurite Pk Quad) - August 7-9, 2005


I don\'t think I could have chosen a more difficult approach  to  climb  this
peak.  Since I wanted to combine it with Ballard, I decided  to  go  in  via
the Canyon Cr, Chancellor Cr and Mill Cr trails to a camp  at  Azurite  Mine
as suggested in the book Summit Routes.  I really  believe  the  authors  of
that book never actually took this route, or maybe they like to sandbag,  as
the problems we ran into were not indicated and their times  were  way  off.
It is ironic that I went this way so I could also bag Ballard, but then  was
so wiped out just getting Azurite that I had to pass on that  peak.  If  all
you are after is Azurite it  is  definitely  better  to  approach  from  the
Methow and Azurite Pass.

To make matters worse I was joined by a new climbing companion,  Annette.  I
lured her to come along with promises of an  easy  all  trail  approach  and
class 3 climbing max. After all the  problems  we  encountered,  I  wouldn\'t
have been surprise if she never wanted to go out with me again. In  the  end
though, I think she enjoyed the trip and did  not  seem  opposed  to  future
trips together.  She is one tough woman.

Things started well enough at the  Canyon  Cr  TH  off  the  North  Cascades
Highway, elev 1900. Oh yes, there was that tiny little sign  on  the  reader
board, so tiny I doubt that anyone but me actually  read  it,  stating  that
the Chancellor trail was closed and impassible to foot and  stock  from  the
Boulder Cr trail all the way to the Slate Pass road. As it was too  late  to
do anything else, we pushed ahead, but I  really  didn\'t  believe  the  sign
anyway.  How could the trail be impassible to foot travel?  There is  always
a way to go. In any event the first 5 miles of  trail  were  a  delight  and
made us think this would be a piece of  cake.  The  trail  was  gentle  with
excellent tread, shady on this  very  warm  day  and  crossed  several  cool
creeks. It did go up and down a bit, but overall we made good  time  to  the
Boulder Cr trail junction.

And then it all gradually fell apart. The trail descended some 400  feet  to
Mill Cr. Near the bottom a section of the trail had slid away,  but  it  was
passable with a few cautious steps.  Not so bad, I thought.  A  nice  bridge
crossed the creek, elev 2600 ft (5.5 miles, 1650 ft, 3 hrs).  On  the  other
side we briefly lost the trail, located it going downstream and then  switch
backing uphill to a junction with the unmarked Mill  Cr  trail.  Now  things
really got interesting. This trail shows no signs of maintenance  for  years
or even recent travel by anyone for that matter.  It  is  not  that  bad  in
wooded areas, but open areas were brushy and just got worse and worse  until
near the end we were head high in, as Annette put  it,  "old  growth"  brush
and ferns and stumbling along feeling our way with our feet. She  does  have
a sense a humor. Good thing because she needed one. We also lost  the  trail
at a rockslide and wandered around for a while before finding it  again.  To
add to our misery, the S facing slopes were sweltering  in  the  midday  sun
and heat and bone dry. We had both run out of water and  were  parched  when
we were saved by the one and only creek about 2.5 miles from the junction.

It took us 3.5 hours to slowly battle our way the 3.3 miles to the  junction
with the Cady Pass "trail", elev 4000 ft. When we reached  the  junction  we
were shocked to discover this "trail" is really a "road"  and  had  recently
been traveled by a tracked vehicle. Ordinarily I would  be  quite  upset  to
come across a road so far into the backcountry, but I  was  so  glad  to  be
free of the awful brush that I welcomed it with open  arms.  The  road  must
have something to do with the mine (I  do  hope  they  are  not  considering
reopening it) and must come  from  the  end  of  the  Slate  Pass  Road.  We
gratefully followed the road the last 1.2 miles to the mine and  a  spacious
flat campsite next to an old mine building, elev 4400 ft (10.5  miles,  3800
ft, 8 hrs.)  The area around the mine was a no man\'s land of bleak red  dirt
tailings. We were visited at dinner by a very healthy looking deer that  had
somehow taken on the color of the tailings.   She  blended  right  into  the
background. We hung our food but that didn\'t stop her from trying  to  reach
it all night long. She didn\'t succeed.

We headed out the next morning optimistic that this  day  would  go  better.
After all the book said 4 hrs from  the  mine  to  the  summit  of  Azurite.
Forget that! Of course I really knew better than to believe  the  book  now.
Our troubles began again as soon as the road crossed Mill Cr  to  head  back
downstream to the mineshaft on the slopes of  Majestic  Mtn.  There  was  no
sign of a trail heading upstream. We wandered  around  a  bit  and  found  a
segment uphill but soon lost it again. Eventually we figured out  it  was  a
waste of time to try and  follow  an  almost  nonexistent  trail,  and  just
traversed upstream a few hundred feet above the creek through  awful  brush,
rockslides and tangled woods until I figured we were close  enough  to  head
straight uphill. It was slow  exhausting  travel,  made  even  worse  by  us
stumbling across a yellow jacket nest and Annette  getting  stung.  But  she
took it all in stride.

After what seemed an eternity, we came to a major gully and followed  it  up
slippery sand covered slab to open slopes below the  cliffs  of  Azurite.  I
had no idea where we were in relation to the usual route from  Azurite  Pass
and along the S ridge, only that  we  were  somewhere  on  the  W  face.  We
continued working our way  up  until  forced  to  traverse  left  below  the
cliffs. I could see a reddish colored gully that offered  a  possible  route
to the summit but the lower section looked ugly and steep.  Easy  ramps  and
wide ledges led left toward the gully higher up. Just before  the  gully  we
came to a narrow exposed class 4 ledge leading  around  a  corner.  At  this
point Annette had reached her scrambling comfort level. It would  take  time
to set up a belay on the ledge traverse and we were running out of time.  So
Annette graciously agreed to wait while I continued on.

I went as fast as I could reasonably safely go and it  took  me  1  hour  RT
from this point (about 8000 ft elev). The ledge continued around the  corner
about 10 feet and allowed a drop into the red gully. This was a  very  loose
unpleasant gully and I knocked rocks down left and right as I climbed up  it
to the top of the ridge.  Much to my dismay I was  still  a  ways  from  the
summit and had to climb over a rib and drop  into  a  second  summit  gully.
This gully was steeper and had a couple of steps  approaching  class  4  and
was also very loose. At the top of this gully, I turned right to the  summit
ridge and followed it the short ways left to the summit (4400  ft,  7  hrs).
Mindful of Annette waiting, I quickly signed the register, noting only  that
it had been placed in 1998, took a picture and headed back down.

I took only a short rest when I was back to Annette, as  I  was  fearful  we
would run out of time if we didn\'t find a faster  way  down.  Thankfully  we
did. We descended the major slabby gully for  a  ways  then  got  onto  much
friendlier terrain on the S side that went all the way down to the  Mill  Cr
valley floor. We then followed along the creek through a  series  of  lovely
meadows, and then in the gravelly creek bottom itself all the way down.   It
was surprisingly open and pleasant most of the  way  and  infinitely  better
than our ascent route. We reached camp at  6:45,  much  sooner  than  I  had
expected (8 miles, 4400 ft, 11 hrs).

I was too tired and my feet too trashed the next morning  to  even  consider
climbing Ballard.  Too bad, it looked to be an easy  climb  from  the  mine.
However, I was happy to just to have made it up Azurite. Neither of  us  was
looking forward to going out the awful Mill Cr trail.  But as is  often  the
case, it wasn\'t as bad as we anticipated.  This time we knew what to  expect
and we were able to stay on the trail without losing  it.  Expectations  can
be everything.  We weren\'t expecting a bad  trail  coming  in  and  we  were
going out. We made it to the Chancellor trail in 2:20 hrs. We  took  a  long
lunch at the Mill Cr crossing, then went out  at  our  separate  paces  with
Annette beating me by a long shot (10.5 miles, 1050 ft, 5:30 hrs).  We  both
washed up in Granite Cr to cool off  and  feel  presentable  for  the  drive
home.

Total: 29 miles and 9250 ft in 3 days

Cosho Pk (8332 ft) and Kimtah Pk (8600+ ft) - Mt Logan and Mt Arriva Quads
- August 15-17, 2005.

It was back to Ragged Ridge to pick up  these  last  two  peaks,  as  I  had
already climbed Mesahchie and Katsuk early in July. I had the  usual  delays
getting to the Easy Pass TH.   They  really  need  to  overhaul  the  permit
process at the Marblemount RS.  It can take upwards of  30  minutes  to  get
one. This time both rangers on duty were busy, one taking care  of  a  large
youth group explaining rules and regulations and checking out multiple  bear
canisters, the other helping a couple who didn\'t know where they  wanted  to
go or for how long. I knew exactly where I  was  going  and  it  would  have
taken me only a few minutes but I had to wait in line.  It  was  finally  my
turn and then the phone rang and of course the ranger gave  that  precedence
over me. And they wonder why some climbers don\'t  bother  with  permits  and
take their chances. And then there was the traffic.  Monday morning  traffic
getting out of town, traffic stopped and backed  up  at  the  Newhalem  rock
slide and slow traffic on Hywy 20  where  many  refuse  to  obey  the  signs
"delay of 5 vehicles illegal, must use turnouts." Slow, slow, slow!

So it was sweltering in the heat of the day by the time  I  finally  started
up the trail to Easy Pass. Then it was down the other side into  the  Fisher
Cr valley and farther down the valley  to  Cosho  Camp,  elev  3750  ft  (10
miles, 2800 ft, 5:15 hrs). This  is  a  very  pleasant  camp  in  the  woods
located right on the banks of Fisher Cr. There are 3 sites far enough  apart
for privacy, each with its own access to the creek. I  took  the  last  site
available.

I began the next day (Tuesday) at 6:45. I knew this would  be  a  long  day.
Summit Routes even suggests a high bivy to allow enough time to  climb  both
peaks, but carrying bivy gear along didn\'t appeal to me. I would  just  have
to fit it all into one day even if that meant coming down in the dark.  Good
thing I didn\'t bivy, as I found no  water  anywhere  on  the  entire  route.
There was some snow on the N side of the main summit ridge, but  that  would
have been a very high bivy indeed. Fortunately, I suspected there  would  be
no water and carried enough with me to last the  day,  although  I  ran  out
near the very end.

Both Becky and Summit Routes tell you to cross Fisher Cr on  the  trail  and
continue downstream Â¼ mile until opposite the Central Gully draining  the  S
slopes of Cosho. This is in error as are  both  the  USGS  and  GT  maps  in
showing where the trail crosses Fisher Cr. It  actually  crosses  the  creek
almost directly opposite the gully so there is no reason to  cross  (perhaps
the trail has been rerouted in recent years). Just before  the  crossing,  I
left the trail and headed uphill in reasonably open forest staying  just  to
the right of the gully until forced by cliffs at about  5000  ft  elev  left
into the Central Gully proper. By now I was above all the  gully  brush  and
the route up was clear.  The bed of  the  gully  was  mostly  water  scoured
(bone dry now) lovely white rock that made for fun scrambling. A  few  class
3-4 short steps added interest.

The gully wound its way through cliffs for a thousand  feet  before  opening
up to wider less constricted terrain and more  unpleasant  loose  scree  and
rocks.  Views of Cosho to the left and the spire of Thieves Pk to the  right
appeared. I worked my way up increasingly  unpleasant  loose  stuff  to  the
8000 ft notch between Cosho and Thieves. The final bit was a short  class  4
step, then class 3 the rest of the way to the summit (4600 ft, 5  hrs).  The
summit register was the original aluminum canister placed by John  Roper  on
his first ascent on June 6, 1970. There were only scraps  of  paper  inside,
but they were in good condition with enough room  for  added  entries  so  I
decided to leave well enough alone and not replace it with a register of  my
own. The screw-on lid was a bit corroded and hard to get off, though,  so  I
lubricated it with my lip balm.  That seemed to help, at least in the  short
term. I again made note of the amazing Skoog brothers who  traversed  Ragged
Ridge on skis on June 1, 1991.

I looked over to Kimtah Pk. It looked an awfully long  ways  away  with  the
imposing obstacle of Thieves Pk between it and me. I  left  Cosho  at  noon,
descending awful loose stuff to about 7200 ft, the first point I  could  get
beneath the cliffs of Thieves Pk.  Here I climbed a steep gully and  heather
face (class 3 and 4) to cross  Thieves\'  S  ridge  at  7600  ft.  An  upward
traverse on ramps and ledges, never very  difficult,  led  to  the  7800  ft
notch to the right of Thieves.   Another  traverse  below  the  ridge  crest
crossed  a  spur  to  the  slopes  SW  of  Kimtah\'s  W  summit.  Of  several
possibilities from here, I chose a high traverse at 8000 ft on  a  prominent
ledge system that worked its way in and out  of  numerous  gullies.  I  came
across one conspicuous cairn so I was on someone\'s route. This was  actually
a fun traverse and I enjoyed it. Once past the cliffs of the  W  summit  and
on the S slopes of Kimtah proper, easy scree led  to  the  ridge  and  final
summit rocks (6350 ft, 9 hrs).

A Mike Torok register placed 7/30/94 graced the summit. There seemed  to  be
more entries than for Cosho, in spite of it being placed later.  I  find  it
hard to believe this peak (which is probably the hardest on Ragged Ridge  to
get to) is climbed more often.  Maybe the scraps  of  paper  were  deceiving
and I just didn\'t see them all. I recognized Don Goodman and Paul  Michelson
7/13/97, Grant Myers and Mitch Blanton 7/20/97, Dale Flynn and  Matt  Burton
8/20/99, and Mike Collins and Don Beavon 8/10/02.

It was now 4:00 and I had a long ways to  go  to  get  down.   It  was  very
tempting to descend directly from Kimtah  to  Fisher  Cr  down  any  one  of
several possible gullies. But I couldn\'t see all the way down  any  of  them
and looking at the map the contours were very close  together  suggesting  I
could run into ugly terrain. No, it was best to go back the way I had  come,
a way I knew would go. I did cross Thieves\' S ridge at a lower  point  (7000
ft) to avoid the steep terrain  I  had  ascended,  but  other  than  that  I
reversed my route back to and down the Central Gully then  into  the  woods.
Things went faster than I expected  and  I  staggered  into  camp  at  8:20,
happily before dark (8 miles, 6500 ft, 13.5 hrs).

When I left town, the forecast for Wednesday was  10%  chance  of  rain  but
with "widespread drizzle."  What on earth did that mean?  It seemed  like  a
contradiction to me. Maybe drizzle doesn\'t qualify as  rain.  The  "drizzle"
forecast made me nervous, so I had brought a full sized tent rather  than  a
bivy tent. Sure enough, during the night it rained  and  continued  to  rain
all the way out the next day (10 miles, 2900 ft, 5.5 hrs - yes  it  took  me
longer to go out than coming in, but it was all up to Easy Pass  and  I  was
tired and wet).

Primus Peak (8508 ft) and Tricouni Peak (8102 ft) - Ross Dam  and  Forbidden
Peak Quads - August 24-26, 2005

Day 1: I thought maybe I could still get up Primus Peak  this  season  if  I
went in from Thunder Creek, although I knew getting up the Borealis  Glacier
this late in a very low snow year could be a problem.  I  went  on-line  and
found out the upper bridge across Thunder  Creek  to  McAllister  Camp  (6.5
miles in) has been replaced after being out for  two  years.   Without  that
bridge I would not have been able to access the route, so it  all  seemed  a
go. It didn\'t occur to me that the lower bridge (1 mile in) would  still  be
out (Why would they replace the upper bridge, and one that only  went  to  a
camp, before the one on the main trail?). I was informed of this  unexpected
fact when I picked up my permit at the Marblemount RS. But the  ranger  made
it sound like no big problem. Just cross  Thunder  Arm  on  the  Highway  20
bridge (elev 1200 ft) and follow the flagged route on the E side of the  Arm
and creek to intersect Thunder Cr trail about 1.5 miles in. It  only  adds  Â½
mile. Yeh, right! Let me tell you this is one rough  detour  that  is  worse
than many climber trails I have been on. It took me 1:15  hr  of  exhausting
travel to intersect the main trail, adding at least 45  minutes  of  time  I
would sorely need later. I recommend not  going  up  the  Thunder  Cr  trail
until the bridge is replaced (hopefully soon),  or  you  will  be  worn  out
before you even start.

Once on the excellent main trail I made much better time. I  passed  Thunder
Cr Camp, where I heard some sort of motorized work going on.  That  is  when
it occurred to me that the Park Service may  have  wanted  to  get  all  the
camps ready for use before opening the main trail so hikers would have  some
place to stay.  Now that made sense to me.  Near  McAllister  Horse  Camp  I
stopped at a creek to fill up on water.  I knew the ridge  route  to  Primus
would have none. Shortly after, I came to the  turnoff  to  McAllister  Camp
and the new bridge over the creek (7 miles,  1300  ft,  4:20  hrs).  On  the
other side 3 new campsites had been carved out of the forest.  Here  I  left
the trail (elev 1900 ft) and headed uphill to the  south  trending  ridge  I
would climb for 4100 ft to the base of the Borealis Glacier.

As I had hoped, once on the crest of  the  ridge  I  picked  up  a  climbers
trail. This trail is rough and steep and works  its  way  up  several  cliff
bands, but I expected this, and it is reasonably easy  to  follow  for  2000
ft, although care must be taken to stay on route. Then comes  a  section  of
dense trees and moderate brush, especially when the ridge levels off  at  Pt
4835, where it is hard to follow. When the ridge steepens again at  5000  ft
and soon opens to heather, the trail gradually improves the rest of the  way
and is once again easily followed.  Good thing, as I was beginning to  worry
about making my camp before dark.

As I pulled over the last rise and had my first view of Tricouni and  Primus
and the Borealis Glacier my heart fell. I would not be climbing  the  normal
route up the glacier to Lucky Pass. The glacier has  receded  so  much,  the
route was either evil looking slabs or evil looking broken up  glacier  ice.
(Every 30 minutes or so, all night and all day, ice would break off the  ice
cliffs of the upper Borealis Glacier and crash down the rock  slabs.  I  was
seeing the glacier disappear before my very eyes.) I would  have  to  go  to
Plan B to climb my peak, except that I didn\'t  know  what  Plan  B  was.   I
would think about that in the morning. Now I had to find  a  place  to  camp
and water quickly. I descended slightly to the toe of the Borealis  Glacier,
or rather to the good-sized ice lake that has  now  formed  at  the  toe.  I
found a flat gravel bar near the shore (elev 6000 ft) for my bivy  tent  (10
miles, 5400 ft, 9 hrs), but there was no running  water  anywhere.  The  ice
lake appeared to have no outlet.  Water would have to  come  from  the  lake
itself, a rather unappealing prospect. The water was cloudy and most  likely
has been locked up in glacier ice for centuries, if not  longer.  It  tasted
that way too, but beggars can\'t be  choosey.  Large  ice  islands  that  had
calved off the glacier edge floated in the pea green soup. Despite the  warm
temperature, a dip was not appealing either in the 32-degree water.



Day 2: I slept in till 7:00, worn out by the previous day and really  having
no plan. I sat staring at Primus while eating breakfast and I came  up  with
3 possible ones. Plan A: I could climb to near the N  ridge  of  Primus  and
then traverse high on the upper Borealis Glacier back  to  Lucky  Pass.  But
the traverse looked almost as bad in places as the direct  route  and  would
be above cliffs with no runout. Plan B: There was a  rock  route  up  the  N
ridge of Primus. But it was low class 5, a thousand  feet  long  and  I  had
only a 60 ft rope and a few slings. Plan C: I could cross the N ridge  to  a
small glacier on the NW slope where a couloir gave  access  to  the  easy  W
ridge. This sounded the most promising, depending on the  condition  of  the
NW glacier. Since all plans involved going to the N ridge that  is  where  I
headed.

The first problem was getting around the ice lake on slabs, not  that  easy.
Then I made my way up heather slopes to  a  spur  ridge,  circumventing  the
lower glacier, until I could work my way up rock to the base  of  the  upper
glacier below Pt 7740. Here I found  welcome  pure  lovely  tasting  running
water, and filled up. I donned crampons and  began  a  traverse  toward  the
7500 ft saddle on the N ridge of Primus.  The steepness  was  only  moderate
but the snow rock hard and icy. My ice axe penetrated  less  than  an  inch.
Self arrest would not be an option.  This convinced me of the folly of  Plan
A. I had enough trouble just making it to the saddle  (1750  ft,  2:45  hr).
The N ridge looked frightful but the NW glacier didn\'t look too bad. It  was
icy but gentle with a good runout. I crossed easily low down until  I  could
see the couloir leading to the W ridge.  Darn,  it  was  still  filled  with
wickedly steep hard hanging snow. No thank you!

Running out of options and not feeling very optimistic,  I  headed  back  to
the N ridge to take a closer look. The NW glacier climbed  high  up  the  NW
slopes and was easier travel than the ridge.  Perhaps I could climb  to  its
highest point and gain the N ridge higher up. I was able to  climb  to  8000
ft before running out of snow, which put me smack in the middle  of  the  NW
face  directly  below  the  summit.  The  face  looked  fairly  broken   up,
especially toward the right and the W ridge,  and  looked  climbable  to  me
(Plan D). It was, barely. Oh it wasn\'t that hard or  even  that  steep,  but
once past some initial  slabs,  the  route  become  very  unpleasant,  nerve
wracking loose dirt and gravel  where  nothing  stayed  put.  I  essentially
crawled my way up the face from solid point to solid  point,  never  feeling
very secure. It took 1.5 hrs to scramble up the 500 ft and emerge  on  the  W
ridge very near the top.  I walked the  few  remaining  feet  to  the  broad
summit (2900 ft, 5:30 hrs.) and left a register in  a  quickly  built  small
cairn. I admired  the  gorgeous  views  all  around,  especially  across  to
Austera and Klawatti (yet to do) and Eldorado and Dorado Needle.

It was now 2:30. I really wanted to climb Tricouni. The  route  is  straight
forward and technically easy, mostly on talus and  stable  rock,  but  would
mean descending 1300 ft to 7200-foot Lucky Pass,  then  up  900  ft  to  the
summit, and then reversing it all back to Primus again.  It was  almost  too
much to consider this late in the day. But I knew if I didn\'t  climb  it  on
this trip, I would probably never climb it. I would  not  be  repeating  the
trip up the ridge to high camp any time soon. So down I went.  Once  I  made
the decision to go I entered a state of mind where I got renewed energy  and
took great enjoyment in moving fast (I left rope and other  gear  on  Primus
to lighten my pack). I almost felt like I was dancing up and down the  rock.
I was on Tricouni in 1:25 hrs (I left another register) and back  to  Primus
1:40 hr more (5000 ft, 9:15 hrs).

Now all I had to do was  get  down  the  awful  NW  face.   Because  of  the
unstable dirt/gravel I did a lot of short rappels on my 60 ft rope, just  so
I wouldn\'t lose my balance and start sliding down the junk. I lost count  of
the number, but it was probably a dozen or  so.  I  didn\'t  have  that  many
slings, but fortunately there were a surprising  number  of  solid  horns  I
could wrap the rope around directly. I did downclimb some  also,  mostly  on
the seat of my pants.  I breathed a sigh of relief when I reached the  snow,
which took another 1.5 hrs. Then it was quickly down to the N saddle,  across
the upper Borealis Glacier and most of the upper rock scramble. I  did  take
time to fill up again on good water for camp. Darkness caught me  on  tricky
slabs above the lower glacier. I couldn\'t see far enough to  find  the  best
route down, so wandered back and forth on ledges finally descending all  the
way to the ice lake just to get my bearings, knowing full well I would  have
to climb up again to get past  some  cliffs  that  went  straight  into  the
water. I dragged into camp at 10:30 (6 miles, 5200  ft,  14  hrs),  all  but
done in. But I did take the time to eat  a  good  dinner  and  rehydrate.  I
would need the energy for the next day.

Day 3: I left at 9:30, dreading the descent of the ridge. It was  almost  as
bad as I anticipated. This is one hard ridge to stay on going down.  And  if
you get seriously off route, heaven help  you.   I  had  fortunately  marked
several waypoints with my GPS on the way up, and this saved me. I  lost  the
trail in the 5000-4000 ft section several times, but my GPS got me  back  on
track.  The lower trail was easier to follow, just darn steep and a pain  to
go down. I made the McAllister bridge at 2:00 and  the  detour  at  5:15.  I
took 15 minutes to check out the old bridge crossing,  hoping  there  was  a
way across so I wouldn\'t have to use the detour. There was  a  large  logjam
but it didn\'t completely cross the creek and the water was too deep and  the
current too swift to ford. So it was the awful detour after all.  Just  what
I needed at the end of 3 hard days. I reached the  car  at  6:40  with  very
sore feet. (10 miles, 900 ft, 9 hrs).

Total: 26 miles and 11,500 ft in 3 days.

Mac Peak (6859 ft) and Swallowtail Peak (6317 ft) - Scenic and Stevens Pass
Quads

September 8-9, 2005

My original plan to climb these Back Court peaks was to hike in  to  a  camp
at Deception Lakes and climb Jungeselle Pk (6527 ft,  S  of  Mac  and  Talus
Lake on The Cradle quad) on the first day, then climb  Mac  and  Swallowtail
and hike out on the second day. However,  Thursday  was  the  only  forecast
good weather day and Friday was supposed to rain, so I  decided  to  reverse
the order and get in the two "harder" (i.e.  take  more  time)  ones  first.
Maybe I could still get up Jungeselle in the rain.

At the last minute Mike Collins joined me. Good thing, as he kept  me  going
at a faster pace than I would have gone alone  and  since  I  didn\'t  get  a
early start (got in late the night before), I doubt I would have  made  both
peaks without him along (of course it was also nice to  have  his  company).
We drove the Tonga Ridge road to the Deception Cr Cutoff  Trail  (elev  3700
ft) and dropped 500 ft to follow the Deception Cr, Deception Lk and  Pacific
Crest Trails to a camp on the N shore of the middle  lake,  elev  5050  (4.5
miles, 1950 ft, 2:20 hrs).

After setting up camp, we took off for Swallowtail at 2:00. From  the  lower
lakes, we worked our way upstream through lovely  meadows  filled  with  the
aroma of ripe blueberries (naturally we had  to  partake),  past  the  upper
lake to the saddle in the ridge N of Mac and dropped into  the  Square  Lake
drainage. Here on the north slopes of Mac we were surprised  to  still  find
an old dirty patch of snow. We contoured the basin and climbed to  the  5960
ft saddle on the NE ridge of Mac. After a  minor  bit  of  confusion  as  to
which peak was actually Swallowtail, we headed NE along the  ridge  dropping
to a 5760 saddle before climbing to the base of  the  impressive  cliffs  on
the NW face of the false summit. We worked around the rocky ridge on  ledges
to the S until we could access the final easy slopes leading to  the  gentle
summit (2200 ft, 2:40 hrs). A tiny cairn marked the top  but  we  could  not
find any register (I left one).

Now setting our sights on Mac, we retraced our steps to the 5960  ft  saddle
then continued SW along the ridge to steep heather slopes and the  E  ridge.
A cliffy section along this ridge required a slight detour to the  S  before
gaining the summit (3600 ft, 4:20 hrs) where we found a  film  can  register
left by Don and Natala Goodman in 1999. It was not in the best of shape,  so
I left a new register and placed the tattered contents of  the  old  one  in
it.

It was now 6:45.  We  could  see  weather  brewing  to  the  W.  Daniel  was
disappearing in the gathering dark clouds. Streaks of  sunbeams  accentuated
the prominent terracing that presumably  gave  Terrace  Mtn  its  name.  The
resulting lighting effects were beautiful but also made us hurry to make  it
back to camp before both storm and darkness hit. We made  a  direct  descent
NW to the lakes, at first down friendly heather,  then  a  not  so  friendly
cliffband and an endless talus field that consisted of huge white  boulders.
We came out right at the PCT bridge over the lake outlet creek  and  reached
camp at 8:20 only needing headlamps at the very end (6 miles, 3750 ft,  6:10
hrs).



Surprisingly, the weather held off until well after midnight,  but  then  it
came in with a vengeance - drenching rain and strong gusty winds.  The  next
morning a short lull in the rain and a tiny blue-sky sucker hole allowed  us
to optimistically think we could still climb Jungeselle. So we  set  off  at
7:30 hiking S on the PCT some 2 miles  (the  trail  loses  600  ft  in  this
distance) until just past the creek draining  Talus  Lake.  Here  we  headed
uphill to Jungeselle\'s S ridge through open timber and light brush.  By  now
it was raining again. Somewhere around 5400 ft the  rain  began  turning  to
snow. By the time we reached the summit ridge, several  inches  of  the  wet
slippery white stuff covered everything. The last bit  to  the  top  was  an
unexpected narrow rocky ridge.  We were able  to  go  several  hundred  feet
along the crest of the ridge, but were stopped  by  a  final  pinnacle  that
required a steep traverse and descent to the final notch. The  summit  block
also looked difficult  and  dicey  under  the  present  conditions,  it  was
snowing so hard we could barely see and both of us were  cold  and  wet.  It
was really quite grim. So we turned around 100 vertical feet and 350  linear
feet from the summit. What ever happened to summer?

The snow followed us all the slip-slidey way down  to  the  trail.  We  were
back to camp at 12:45 (7 miles, 3000 ft, 5:15 hrs), where  both  tents  were
covered with over an inch of snow. We took an hour to  put  on  dry  clothes
and warm up before leaving at 2:00 and arriving at  the  car  at  4:00  (4.5
miles, 600 ft, 2 hrs).

Total: 22 miles and 9300 ft in 2 days

The Robin Lakes area is so beautiful it is well  worth  a  trip  in  itself.
Gorgeous white  granite  slabs  alternating  with  rolling  meadows  provide
friendly rambling terrain. Numerous sparkling lakes  and  tarns  fill  every
basin and around  every  corner  are  new  delights  and  hidden  nooks  and
corners. Add four new peaks, no bugs and few people this time  of  year  and
it is heaven on earth. It doesn\'t get any better than this!

I began from the Deception Pass Trail (elev 3400 ft), at the end of the  Cle
Elum River Road, and hiked the 4.5 miles to  the  Robin  Lakes  junction.  I
passed two older women struggling up the steep,  rough  1.5  mile  trail  to
Tuck Lake, 1000 ft below Robin Lakes. They asked me if I had  ever  been  up
this trail before.  "Yes", I replied. "Does the trail  to  Robin  Lakes  get
any worse?" they then asked. "Most certainly", I answered.  "It  requires  a
bit of scrambling and following cairns across slabs." They  looked  dismayed
as they explained they had started backpacking late in  life  and  this  was
the hardest thing they had ever done. I  encouraged  them  and  wished  them
luck, but I knew that if they were having trouble on this section they  most
likely would not make it to the higher lakes. Too bad.

From Tuck Lake, I continued up  the  worsening  way  trail  as  it  wandered
through cliff bands and then leveled somewhat the last bit to crossing  huge
slabs, marked by cairns, to then drop to the lower of the two  Robin  Lakes.
At 3:00 I found a secluded spot for my tent in the bed of a  tiny  dried  up
tarn (where I could do no damage) above the upper lake (7  miles,  3350  ft,
4:30 hrs). I took off an hour later for S  Granite  Mtn.  The  route  was  a
sheer pleasure of expanding views down to the lakes  and  scrambling  across
slabs, heading toward then contouring beneath  Granite  Mtn  to  the  saddle
with the S Pk. Here were nestled twin tarns sparkling in the  sunshine.  The
final easy ascent was up the NW ridge (1250 ft, 1:30 hr). A tiny  cairn,  in
which I left a register, marked the summit. On the way back I saw a herd  of
half a dozen mountain goats, always such a treat. (3 miles, 1650 ft,  3  hrs
RT)

Most of the first day (Tuesday) was sunny and warm, but by the  time  I  got
back to camp it was beginning to cloud up, Mt  Daniel  was  disappearing  in
the fog and a cold wind was blowing.  I was afraid the weather was  changing
for the worse, but when I awoke Wednesday morning, it was still fine  except
for a few clouds.  It did get cloudier with fog forming on  the  summits  as
the day progressed but it never rained. I left  at  8:30,  climbing  to  the
Trico-Granite divide above Granite Mtn Potholes  and  working  my  way  down
over gorgeous massive white slabs to the heather and blueberry  basin  below
the SW slopes of W French Ridge.  Progress was slow as I grazed on the  ripe
fruit along the way. I climbed to the S ridge and followed this the rest  of
the way to the top (670 ft, 1:20 hr). The actual summit was a 10 ft  boulder
that I surmounted with an assist from my rope thrown over the top.   I  left
another register and improved the cairn tottering on the sloping top  but  I
am not optimistic either will stay there long.

The E face of this peak is quite sheer and impressive,  but  by  going  down
the S ridge a short ways I found a reasonable route  directly  down  to  the
saddle with Pt 6555. I then had to skirt cliffs below this  point  to  reach
the saddle between it and E French Ridge from where easy slopes led  to  the
summit (1745 ft, 3:30 hrs). I was surprised to find a tiny register on  top,
but I recognized it as one of Dick Kegel\'s even before I opened it.  He  had
placed it on 9/21/03 and his was the  only  entry.   These  obscure  unnamed
peaks aren\'t climbed very often.

By 2:00 I had worked my way back to the  blueberry  basin  SW  of  W  French
Ridge. I now had a decision to  make.  It  was  still  early.   I  could  go
directly back to camp and lounge around for several hours  (actually  rather
appealing) ORâ¦.  I could see Jungeselle off in the distance.  This  was  the
peak I had barely missed last week with Mike Collins due to miserable  snowy
conditions.  It looked an awfully long ways away (probably  about  3  rugged
miles) and would require dropping 1000 ft  to  Lake  Phoebe.  On  the  other
hand, the route looked feasible and it was the last of the  100  Back  Court
Peaks for me to do. So off I went, knowing that I might  not  make  it  down
before dark.

I dropped the distressing 1000 ft to Lake Phoebe, skirted  the  W  shore  on
slowing  talus,  traversed  above  Lower  Phoebe  Lake  through  woods  then
foolishly chose a high line climbing to 6000 ft on tedious talus above  both
Jungfrau Lake and the small unnamed lake above it. I  then  contoured  below
the cliffs of Jungeselle\'s E face until I could climb up to  the  open  left
slanting heather ramp  I  had  spotted  from  a  distance.   This  ramp  led
directly to the notch between the summit and the pinnacle that  had  stopped
Mike and me. The dark slabs that had appeared so  ominous  to  Mike  and  me
were easily turned to the left and I emerged on the summit of my  last  Back
Court Peak at 5:00 (3825  ft,  8:30).  Again  only  a  small  cairn  and  no
register.  I left my third of the day. No view of Mac. It and  most  of  the
surrounding area was in the fog.

Tired of talus hopping, I took a lower line directly down  the  drainage  on
mostly heather to the unnamed lake, Jungfrau Lake  and  Lower  Phoebe  Lake.
Much faster and easier. I found a way trail leading up to Lake Phoebe  where
there was no avoiding the talus on its shore once again. I wanted  to  climb
directly to Granite Mtn Potholes but from below I didn\'t  pick  the  correct
gully through the many cliffs and ended up in one farther E. This gully  got
frightfully steep near the top, so I exited on  ledges  to  the  left  where
darkness caught me on the same massive white slabs I had  descended  earlier
in the day. I wandered around a bit in the dark in the confusing  flat  area
of the Trico-Granite saddle until I stumbled across  the  way  trail  around
Upper Robin Lake and found my way to camp at 8:30 (10  miles,  5250  ft,  12
hrs).

It sprinkled during the night, but nothing serious.   The  next  day  dawned
foggy but cleared to just cloudy and cool. I left at 9:30  and  reached  the
car at 1:45, stopping for lunch on the way (7 miles, 500 ft, 4:15  hrs),  an
easy end to a lovely trip.

Total: 27 miles and 10,750 ft in 3 days

Bandit Peak (7625 ft) - Schaefer Lake Quad - September 17-18, 2005


Bandit can be done as a long day climb, but Jim Brisbine and I were  happier
turning it into a more leisurely two-day trip.  That  allowed  for  a  later
start in the morning. Thus we were able to begin from the Schaefer  Lake  TH
(elev 2500 ft), on the Chiwawa River Road, a little after noon.  The  logjam
was in place for an easy crossing of the Chiwawa River and  the  good  trail
and good conversation put us at Schaefer Lake (elev 5100 ft) in what  seemed
no time at all (5 miles, 2750 ft, 2:30 hrs). From the lake we happened  upon
an unexpected way trail that led easily to the long 6100 ft  saddle  between
Pts 6931 and 6641 (6 miles, 3850 ft, 3:45 hrs). Here we  dropped  our  packs
for a quick scramble up Pt 6764 (Jim had climbed this peaks  previously  but
he graciously accompanied me up it) and a great view of  our  objective  and
down to D Lake (1 mile, 1.5 hrs and 650 ft RT counting  Â½  hour  on  top).  A
tiny register was on top placed by a fellow who had just climbed  it  a  few
weeks earlier.

Our original intention was to camp at D Lake. The  saddle  itself  was  very
appealing with friendly flat grassy terrain and a great view,  but  appeared
at first glance to be without water. As we began the descent to D Lake  what
should run across but a welcome trickling creek! That cinched it and we  set
up a delightful camp in this delightful spot.

The next morning was chilly with frost on  the  tent  but  with  clear  blue
skies. We descended some 200 feet down the  gully  on  the  N  side  of  our
saddle to the upper end of D Lake basin, climbed up  talus  and  heather  to
cross an E trending spur ridge at 6400 ft  and  began  a  long  traverse  on
talus on E slopes below cliffs until we could easily  climb  to  Bandit\'s  N
ridge at about 7300 ft. We were now somewhat surprised to find  the  terrain
more intimidating than expected. There were  cliffs  on  both  side  of  the
ridge and the only feasible route was following the  crest.  We  worked  our
way S along the ridge and discovered it was not as  difficult  as  it  first
appeared, but it was always near the upper limit of comfortable  scrambling.
At one point we had to descend on the E face to  get  past  a  sharp  notch.
From the notch more steep scrambling put us on the summit of the NE Pk.

 Now came the challenge of getting off this summit.  Beckey  mentions  an  E
and W Pk, with the W Pk being higher, but I would describe Bandit as  having
three summits, NE and SE Pts on the main N-S ridge, and  the  actual  summit
being slightly off this main ridge to the W.  The notch between the  NE  and
SE Pks was frightfully steep and not accessible directly from the summit  we
were on. We could, however, see a ramp/ledge system leading W to  the  small
bowl surrounded by all three summits, from where it appeared to be  an  easy
scramble to the true summit. Fortunately Jim had brought his 75 ft  scramble
rope and we made good use of this for a short rappel down a  step  onto  the
ramp. Steep down climbing with two more short steps  and  we  were  able  to
scramble on to the summit (2150 ft, 4:15 hrs).

An interesting large round  cookie  tin  held  the  summit  register,  which
consisted of scraps of deteriorating paper. I placed the  scraps  in  a  new
register of mine that I then put back in the cookie tin. The earliest  entry
I could make out (just barely) was in 1990 by one  of  the  Praters.  Others
were Don Goodman in 1993, Don Beavon and Mitch Blanton  in  1998,  and  Greg
Koenig also in 1998. There were a total of  7  entries.  This  peak  is  not
climbed all that often. The most interesting comment was  by  a  fellow  who
climbed it in 2000 stating, "A tough Peak.  My route was so complex I  doubt
I can describe it to anyone.  There must be  an  easier  way."   Perhaps  he
followed the route in an old Beckey that suggests  following  the  ridge  on
the WEST! side all the way from Schaefer Lake. That is  the  way  Greg  went
but from the map it looks to me as if it would be an awful route.

We made note of the  fact  that  Mitch  and  Don  had  climbed  up  via  the
prominent E gully between the SE and NE Pks, and decided  that  would  be  a
more direct route down to the talus fields.  It  was  but  it  was  also  an
awful, steep, loose route with not too much  to  recommend  it.  There  were
several steps in the 1000 ft gully.  We took comfort  in  knowing  we  could
rappel if necessary (we did  pass  one  rappel  sling  left  by  a  previous
party), but we always found a scramble way down. We arrived back in camp  at
3:45 (4 miles, 2700 ft, 7:45 hrs), quickly packed up, leaving at  4:30,  and
reached the car at 7:00 (6 miles, 150 ft, 2.5 hr). A lovely trip with a  good
companion and unexpected challenging but pleasant scrambling.

Total: 17 miles and 7350 ft in 2 days

Crook Mtn (6930 ft) - Schaefer Lake Quad - September 21, 2005


With only a short day available I decided to see if I  could  approach  this
peak from the maze of logging roads on the  SE  side.  I  turned  left  onto
Meadow Cr Rd 6300 from the Chiwawa River  Rd  just  before  it  crosses  the
river, right on 6307, and left on 6306. The gate shown  at  the  next  major
intersection on the GT map is not in evidence and I  was  able  to  continue
driving another 2 miles to where the road comes very near the old Raging  Cr
Trail (elev 3400 ft). This last bit of the  road  is  quite  overgrown  with
alder scratching both sides of  the  car  but  other  than  that  is  easily
drivable.

I picked up the trail a very short ways to the left  in  woods.  This  trail
appears to be abandoned but is still  in  reasonable  shape  and  is  fairly
easily followed. It climbs steadily to 4800 ft, then drops for  no  apparent
reason to 4400 ft, crosses a creek, passes a hunter  camp,  and  wanders  up
and down a bit before a final steep climb to end on the NE spur of  Pt  5999
at elev 5400 ft. (4 miles, 2800 ft, 2.5 hrs).

From trail end I followed the spur SW to Pt 5999, and then  the  main  ridge
NW all the way to the summit of Crook Mtn.  This ridge is quite  rocky  with
many bumps and obstacles that required  minor  detours,  mostly  on  the  SW
slope  but  occasionally  on  the  NE  slope,  but  is  for  the  most  part
interesting and fun scrambling.  It took the  better  part  of  2  hours  to
traverse the ridge and climb the final open heather slopes to the top  (4800
ft, 4:50 hrs). I found a tiny film can register with many familiar names  in
the summit cairn. Most had come from Schaefer  Lake  while  climbing  others
peaks in the area: Mitch Blanton and Don Beavon on 9/14/98, Don  Goodman  on
8/8/99 (his fifth time up, on a grand traverse this time),  Janet  Putz  and
Mike Torok on 9/2/01 and Greg Koenig on  9/11/01.  The  last  entry  was  in
2004.

It was now 5:15 and I was running out of time (the days are getting  shorter
way too fast), so to speed things up I dropped into the basins SE  of  Crook
to return to the trail. I made  splendid  time  through  lovely  meadows  at
first but eventually I had to crash horrid  brush  traversing  below  cliffs
back to the spur. However, I  still  made  it  to  the  trail  in  1:20  hr.
Darkness caught me 40 minutes from the car. I worried  about  following  the
faint trail by headlamp but it was  surprisingly  easy  to  stay  on  and  I
reached the car at 8:30.

 Total: 12 miles, 5700 ft and 8:30 hrs.

Mt Index (5991 ft) - Index Quad - September 24-25, 2005


I had climbed Mt Index many years ago from Lake Serene and I  was  not  very
keen on a repeat ascent. However, my son, Walter, really wanted to climb  it
so I reluctantly agreed to accompany him, but  by  which  route?   None  are
really appealing. The route via Lake Serene is technical late  in  the  year
and the traverse from Persis long with many ups and  downs.  That  left  the
"direct" route from the N Fork Tolt Road. Direct, that is after  getting  to
the final logging road. With a gate preventing vehicle access,  6  miles  of
boring roads must be traveled first. Bicycles seemed the order  of  the  day
for this. So the two of us tried this route last  year  in  August  the  day
after a heavy rain. We encountered wet alder on  the  very  overgrown  final
logging road and then horrid brush, also still wet,  once  leaving  the  old
road. We ran out of time, energy and desire and turned around some  1500  ft
below the summit. I vowed never to return - well,  at  least  not  when  the
brush is wet.

This time we planned on 2 days, with a bivy at the  end  of  the  old  road.
With a perfect weather forecast the brush should be  dry.  We  started  from
the gate on the Proctor Cr Road, elev 1600  ft,  on  bicycles  at  2:00  pm.
After 2 slightly downhill miles, we turned left onto the N  Fork  Tolt  Road
steeply at first then gently uphill 3 more miles before turning left onto  a
spur where the main road descends to cross the river. Another  mile  brought
us to a junction, elev 2000 ft, where we stashed the  bikes  (6  miles,  600
ft, 1:30 hrs) and started hiking left uphill. At a junction  with  a  quarry
spur we turned left again. Last year starting at  this  point  we  ran  into
terrible thick (and wet) overgrown alder. At places you  could  barely  bull
your way through. This time the road was completely cleared. What  a  shock!
Why on earth would they have cleared the road? This lasted  past  the  first
switchback to the first small creek crossing,  maybe  a  mile,  and  had  we
known, bicycles could have been ridden this  far.   Beyond  the  creek,  the
road was ditched a dozen or so times as if to  decommission  it.   But  why?
The road was nicely returning to nature on its own  with  alders  and  brush
already having a nice start. Probably some nonsensical rule or regulation.

Beyond the ditching the road returned to the condition we knew so well  from
last year, thick overgrown  alder.   I  had  brought  clippers  and  clipped
minimally just enough to get through as we slowly  worked  our  way  up  the
road. We followed the old road some 2 more miles past  3  more  switchbacks,
with it getting rougher and rockier all the time, to its high point at  4000
ft (9 miles, 2600 ft, 4 hrs). Here we cleared two tiny bivy spots among  the
boulders. The road continued a short rough  distance  slightly  downhill  to
end at a deep ravine where we found a  tiny  trickle  of  water.  It  was  a
surprisingly pleasant camp and we  fell  asleep  watching  the  sunset  over
Puget Sound.

We started the next morning at 8:00 leaving the road almost  directly  above
our camp. We worked our way up and right through horrid steep brush  growing
over horrid old logging slash, avoiding a cliff and crossing above a  ravine
to traverse to the ridge coming S from Pt 5212 crossing at 4700  ft.  It  is
only 700 ft of elevation gain to here but this section is  really  the  crux
of the whole climb and a real trial but at least it was  dry.  The  rest  of
the route is easy and a pleasure in comparison. We dropped slightly off  the
ridge into a lovely meadow bench where we had a clear view of the route  and
the summit. We followed the bench N, grazing  on  blueberries  as  we  went,
above a ravine toward Anderson Pass until  we  could  traverse  right  below
cliffs to reach the 5500 ft notch in the W ridge of  Index.  We  crossed  to
the N and traversed steep dirt below cliffs until we  could  turn  right  up
the final easy talus and heather slopes to the summit (2150 ft, 3:45 hrs).

What a glorious place! Views in every  direction.  The  rugged  Persis-Index
ridge was very impressive from this side. Lake Serene was partially  visible
3500 feet straight  down  impossibly  steep  cliffs.  Up  close  were  Gunn,
Merchant, Baring, and off  in  the  distance  Baker,  Glacier,  Mt  Rainier,
Stuart, and on and on seemingly forever.  I  also  closely  examined  Middle
Index and wondered if I would ever be able to climb it to  finish  the  Home
Court list (it will probably be the last one left after  whittling  away  at
the others). It actually didn\'t look that bad  itself  but  getting  to  the
notch below it looked frightful. We took over an hour soaking it all  up  in
the warm sunshine.

A trip report from 1997 stated a register was on the summit,  but  we  could
not find one.  That was a disappointment, as I  really  wanted  to  see  how
often this peak is climbed. I know someone had climbed  it  recently  as  we
ran into fresh footprints, from the day before if I had to guess,  from  the
notch on. I did leave a new register of my own but I doubt I  will  ever  be
back to check it for entries.

We left the summit at 1:15 and meandered back to the meadow bench.  We  were
reluctant to leave this glorious area, seldom visited by others.  Once  over
the ridge, we plunged once again down the horrid brush.  It  was  every  bit
as bad going down as it was on the way up.  It is very easy to get  hung  up
on hidden cliffs and steep gullies. Somehow we managed to hit  the  road  at
exactly the same spot we had left it (3 miles, 2250 ft, 7:50 hr total).

We quickly packed up camp and reached our bikes in 1:45 hr and the car in  a
little over an hour more, just as it was getting dark at 7:30 (9 miles,  250
ft, 3:00 hrs total from camp). We were both elated to have  pulled  off  the
ascent of this well known but elusive peak and it was a very special Mother-
Son trip to remember for a long time to come.

Total: 21 miles and 5100 ft in 2 days

Dip Top Peak (7291 ft) and Lynch Peak (7280+ ft) - Mt Daniel Quad

October 4-5, 2005

I had originally planned to climb these two peaks from Marmot  Lake  to  the
north, but that seemed like an awfully  long  route  and  would  take  three
days. If I approached from the east, I figured I could  shorten  it  to  two
days. And with only one day forecast to  be  really  good  weather,  I  also
hoped I could climb both peaks on the first day after  setting  up  camp.  I
was a bit optimistic in that assessment.

For the second time in less than a month (see Back  Court  Finale)  I  found
myself hiking up the Deception Pass Trail at the end of the Cle  Elum  River
Road. At Deception Pass, elev 4500 ft (5 miles, 1250 ft, 2:10 hr), I went  S
on the Pacific Crest Trail about 1.5 miles, losing 600  ft  in  the  process.
Shortly before crossing the creek draining the 4900  ft  flat  basin  SE  of
Lynch, I left the trail at elev 3900 ft and headed  steeply  uphill  through
the forest. After a few hundred feet I stumbled onto an old climbers  trail.
This trail doesn\'t look as if it has been used recently, but once above  the
dense forest, it is fairly distinct and greatly facilitates  route  finding.
It essentially follows the rib to the N  of  the  deep  creek  ravine  until
above the basin, then works its way  through  cliffs  to  traverse  to  open
talus slopes below Lynch Pk. I began running into snow at about 5000 ft  and
by the time I found a campsite at Lynch Draw by Pea  Soup  Lake,  elev  6300
ft, the snow was 6-12" deep where it wasn\'t melted off (8  miles,  3900  ft,
5:30 hrs).

The rugged terrain and snow-covered talus had taken more  time  than  I  had
hoped.  By the time I set up camp and started for  my  peaks  it  was  5:00.
Yet both peaks looked so close and easy on the map, I thought I could  still
squeeze them in before dark. They were only 1000 ft above me. All I  had  to
do was get to Dip Top Gap between the peaks. Dip Top looked easy via  the  E
ridge. The W ridge of Lynch did look steeper but Beckey said it was an  easy
class 2 scramble and if that didn\'t work the S slope appeared feasible.

The first problem was getting to Dip Top Gap.  I  couldn\'t  get  around  Pea
Soup Lake on a low traverse due to cliffs that went into the water and  when
I tried a high traverse I ended up 200 ft above the gap with  cliffs  below.
It sure didn\'t look that steep on the map. The only possible  way  down  was
an exposed ramp-ledge system that diagonalled down  across  the  cliff  back
toward the lake. It was a very interesting route, made more  interesting  by
snow and wet rock, but it took time I  didn\'t  have  to  spare  and  led  to
treacherous snow-covered talus way below the gap that took  even  more  time
to climb back up.

The second problem was that Dip Top is not an  easy  walkup  from  the  gap.
Cliffs and slabs forced a circuitous route on  the  SE  side  to  the  final
narrow exposed summit ridge.  By the time I summited it  was  6:40  and  the
light was fading fast (1400 ft, 1:40 hr). I quickly added a register to  the
summit cairn and headed down to escape the increasing cold wind.

The third problem was that the W ridge of Lynch was not  class  2  from  the
gap.  It didn\'t even look class 3. In fact it didn\'t look climbable  without
a rope under the current conditions. But that was really  a  moot  point  as
there was no way I could still climb Lynch this  day.   I  had  run  out  of
time.  I would have my problems just getting back to camp in the  dark.  The
snow was good for one thing though - I could follow my  footprints  much  of
the way, which was most helpful in staying on track. I was not able to  find
any shortcut through the cliffs lower down by the light of my  headlamp,  so
I was forced to climb back up the  ramp-ledge  system.  I\'m  not  even  sure
there was a better way. The cliffs on that side  are  extensive.  I  dragged
into camp at 8:20 (2 miles, 1850 ft, 3:20 hr). So much for a simple  ascent.
 I just hoped the weather would hold so I could climb Lynch in the morning.

A strong wind roared all night threatening to blow my tent and me  into  the
next county and light snow fell but the next morning dawned with  reasonable
conditions. It was cloudy and still snowing lightly off and on but the  wind
died down a bit. I set out for Lynch at 8:15. Using my  tracks  of  the  day
before until below the S slopes I then climbed rapidly  up  easy  slopes  to
the summit (.5 mile, 1000 ft, :50 hr). I left another register and was  back
to camp by 9:45. This ascent was as easy as I had hoped.

I left at 10:30 taking my time going down so as  not  to  lose  the  way.  I
still lost it in the forest some 500 ft above the PCT and  got  too  far  to
the N. Here I was suckered in to continuing to the next drainage N  where  I
could see an inviting meadow. The meadow was nice,  while  it  lasted,  then
funneled into a waterfall creek ravine that  I  avoided  by  crashing  awful
steep brush to the side until I  was  spit  out  onto  the  PCT.  I  do  not
recommend this route. A half mile before the PCT reached  Deception  Pass  I
took a XC shortcut to hit  the  Deception  Pass  Trail  at  the  Robin  Lake
turnoff. This saved me about a mile of circuitous trail  hiking.  I  reached
the car at 4:00 (8 miles, 750 ft, 5:30) after a short stop for lunch. I  had
a few sprinkles on the way out but nothing serious.

Total: 19 miles and 7500 ft in 2 days.

Mt David (7420 ft - 2420P) and Mt Jonathan (7195 ft - 275P) - Mt David and
Poe Mtn Quads - October 14, 2005

I wanted a good workout but only had the day available as I drove back  from
a family get together in Chelan. The Mt David trail seemed to fit the  bill.
I started from the end of the White River Road past Lake  Wenatchee  on  the
Indian Cr Trail, elev 2300 ft. Directly after crossing the bridge  over  the
White River, I turned left downstream a long mile,  annoyingly  losing  some
200 ft, until I came to the Mt David Trail.  This  good  trail  now  climbed
steadily to first gain the ridge at 5300 ft and then wander along the  ridge
or on one side or the  other  through  lovely  alpine  terrain  to  the  old
lookout site on the summit (8 miles, 5600 ft, 4:10 hrs).

I had hoped to add Mt Jonathan to the agenda but wasn\'t sure  how  difficult
the traverse was from David or if  I  had  enough  time  to  find  the  way.
Although there was some fog, I had glimpses of views and even the  sun  when
the fog thinned momentarily and the weather seemed to be holding. I had  run
into a few inches of snow on the trail on the NE exposure above 7000 ft  and
there was more on the NW side, but the southern slopes were completely  snow
free. So I decided to give it a try.

I retreated a short ways down the trail until I could traverse  W  and  then
descend to about 6800 ft on easy SW slopes. I  decided  to  stay  below  the
ridge (it looked worse than it was), planning to drop further  to  easy  alp
slopes and bypass a buttress completely but  found  myself  trapped  at  mid
level on cliffs and slabs  with  no  way  down.  Fortunately,  a  continuous
interesting but exposed ledge led all the way across the problem area on  an
upward traverse until I could gain the ridge  again.  I  then  followed  the
crest of the ridge with pleasant scrambling all the way to the point  marked
7195 ft on the map.  Unfortunately,  this  is  not  the  high  point  and  I
glimpsed a higher summit .1 mile farther W peaking out of the fog. For  this
last bit, I descended slightly to avoid the  jumbled  ridge  and  approached
the final top from the S.  Sure enough here I  found  a  cairn  to  which  I
added one of my registers (500 ft, 1:10 hrs from David).

I stayed high on the way back to Mt David, avoiding  the  ledge  across  the
cliff.  This was an easier way to go. I hit the  trail  at  5:30  (1.5  mile,
1000 ft, 2:15 hrs RT from David). Darkness caught me  about  1.5  hours  from
the TH and I came out the rest of the way by headlamp reaching  the  car  at
8:30.

Total: 17.5 miles, 7000 ft and 9:45 hrs.

Ares Pk (Venus-Spade) - 6596 ft - Mt Daniel Quad - October 26-28, 2005


With a good weather forecast for Wednesday and  Thursday  (but  rain  and  a
4500 ft snow level for Thursday night and Friday) and  much  of  the  recent
snow melted off, I felt I had a good shot at this Home Court  Peak  near  Mt
Daniel. I would need a full day to hike the 13.5 miles to Spade  Lake  where
I intended to camp.

Beginning at the spacious multiple trailhead near Salmon La Sac  (elev  2500
ft), I hiked the Waptus River Trail  with  its  numerous  annoying  ups  and
downs a long 9.5 miles to the Spade Lake Trail Junction. The  net  elevation
gain up to this point was a scant 500 ft (gross gain was 3 times that),  but
the Spade Lake Trail quickly made up for this gaining 1500  ft  straight  up
the hillside before beginning a long traverse punctuated  by  several  steep
descents followed by even more steep ascents and gaining  another  1500  ft.
Views of snowy Summit Chief and Bears Breast appeared in  openings  on  this
mostly sunny day. By the time I reached the basin of  Spade  Lake  dusk  was
falling. I spent another 45 minutes wandering around  in  the  dark  looking
for a decent campsite at the S end of the lake. This area  is  riddled  with
deep slots between steep slabs and what isn\'t rocky is filled with ponds  or
marshy ground. Campsites were few and far between. I finally  found  a  rare
level spot on bare ground a hundred feet or so above  the  lake,  elev  5350
ft, and set up my tent by headlamp (13.5 miles, 4500 ft, 8 hrs).

In these last days of Daylight Savings Time, dawn comes late. It was  barely
light at 7:30 am, so I didn\'t get going until 8:30 the next morning.  But  I
was in no hurry.  After all I had all day to get up and down my peak and  it
wasn\'t that far away.  I even entertained thoughts of  beating  the  weather
and going out the same day if I got back to camp early enough. Little did  I
know I would need most of the day just for the climb! But  than  I  seem  to
have a talent for making a peak more difficult and taking more time than  is
usual.

I began by taking the way trail around the E side of the  lake  and  heading
for the waterfall stream flowing from Venus Lake at the N end. There  was  a
heavy frost during the night and  I  crunched  along  on  frozen  ground.  I
climbed the gorgeous white slabs to the  right  of  the  waterfall,  a  most
enjoyable scramble but carefully avoiding icy sections,  emerging  into  the
rather barren basin of Venus Lake, 450 ft above Spade Lk. My intended  route
up the E slopes of Ares looked much more intimidating than I  had  expected,
with downsloping slabs and  rock  cliffs.  The  face  was  quite  broken  up
though, and under warm summer conditions would be a pleasant  scramble,  but
covered with patches of snow and ice, I was challenged to  pick  my  way  up
safely. I ended up on the N ridge separated from the summit by a  small  but
impassible notch. I had to pass it by descending on the  slippery  snowy  NW
side. Then I dropped one of my poles and had  to  descend  even  farther  to
retrieve it, but hey I was lucky it didn\'t keep  falling  hundreds  of  feet
into the headwaters of Shovel Lake never to be seen again.

I topped out on Ares flat summit at 11:00  (1600  ft,  2:30  hrs),  where  I
located one of the cutest summit registers I have come across,  a  tiny  Oil
of Olay bottle complete with the tiniest of pencils (1  inch  long).  Inside
was a John Roper business card folded 4 times to  fit.  He  had  climbed  on
7/13/97 in a party of five. There were only 2 other  entries,  Mike  Collins
and Don Beavon on 7/3/03 and John Morrow, wilderness ranger, on 7/10/05.  As
there was very little room for more names, I added a  register  of  mine  to
the summit cairn.

I am sure the views would have been gorgeous if  I  could  have  seen  them.
Unfortunately the high peaks were all in the  fog,  where  they  stayed  all
day.  I never even caught a glimpse of Mt Daniel. The weather  was  actually
not as good as I had hoped this day, and in  fact  looked  as  if  it  could
start precipitating at any moment. And I was getting a little worried as  to
how to get off my peak.  I had no rope (Why do I always talk myself  out  of
the added weight of bringing a rope - you would think I would know  better!)
and didn\'t want to descend the slippery slabs I had come up, and so  decided
to go down the S side, thinking that would be less icy. Not a  good  choice.
In this case the evil that I knew (the E side) was better than  the  evil  I
did not know (the S side).

The descent started well, with easy ramps and scree leading past cliffs.  At
one point I had to backtrack to avoid a wet slab but I quickly found  a  way
past it. Then I was funneled into an  ugly  wet  gully.  I  bypassed  it  by
lowering myself on brush "rappels" to a ledge that  skirted  the  top  of  a
final cliff. I could see I only had 20 feet or so to  go  to  easy  terrain,
but I couldn\'t find a safe way down. A broken area looked doable but it  was
not only wet but also coated in ice. I resigned myself to climbing back  up.
 My poles were really in the way, so I tossed them over the cliff,  planning
to retrieve them once down. I muscled my way  back  up  the  brush  "rappel"
until I could cross the ugly gully to the W, where  I  found  another  cliff
that was covered with brush (that I could  hang  onto)  all  the  way  down.
Sometimes brush is useful.

I traversed back to below my problem cliff looking  for  my  poles,  and  of
course I couldn\'t find them. I must have spent a  good  45  minutes  looking
for them and being very confused and puzzled before I realized I  was  below
a lower cliff band. From above it had appeared a continuous  slope  all  the
way down. It fact there was a shelf between  two  cliff  bands.  Fortunately
the lower cliffs were easily climbed and when I climbed  up  to  the  shelf,
there were my poles.

Not yet done with bad decisions, I returned to camp by going  around  the  W
side of Spade Lake.  No trail along this side should have been  a  clue.   I
ran into brush and one cliff that went right into the  water  that  required
an unpleasant detour. But the S end of the lake was delightful  with  lovely
striated slabs,  picturesque  slots,  numerous  ponds  and  tarns  and  tiny
meadows that made up for my trials. I am embarrassed to say when I got  back
to camp, but it was much too late to think about heading out (4 miles,  2400
ft, 6:40 hrs).

I spent what was left of the day  enjoying  my  beautiful  surroundings  and
fixing in my mind the route out of the basin so I could find  my  way  after
the snowfall, which I was sure was on its way.  Sure  enough,  it  began  to
snow about 8:00  pm  and  snowed  all  night.  By  morning  4-5  inches  had
accumulated transforming all to a fresh winter white. The snow  stayed  with
me to 4000 ft where it was melting  rapidly  and  dripping  off  the  trees.
Scattered showers followed me the rest of the way out (13.5 miles, 1300  ft,
7:20 hrs).

Total: 30 miles and 8400 ft in 3 days.       Fay Pullen

Galleon Mtn (5283 ft) and Sorcery Mtn (5273 ft) - Snoqualmie Lk Quad -
November 2-3, 2005

With shorter days and lowering snow level, I am lowering  my  ambitions  and
staying closer to home.  But the  summits  don\'t  seem  to  be  getting  any
easier to attain. I had to work very  hard  to  get  these  two  Home  Court
peaks. Well, Sorcery wasn\'t that bad but Galleon was a real effort.

The weather was better than I expected when I started  up  the  Dingford  Cr
Trail off the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River Road, elev  1400  ft.  It  wasn\'t
raining and the sun even made a brief appearance.  After  about  2  miles  I
found the way trail to Horseshoe Lake between the braids of  Goat  Cr,  elev
2600 ft. I would have stayed dry the whole way, but  after  500  ft  gain  I
began running into melting snow on trees and brush. This was as  bad  as  or
worse than rain. I reached Horseshoe Lk at 12:00 where I had hoped  to  camp
at the outlet but it was all big boulders and brush. I finally found a  tent
site at the base of the W ridge of Sorcery that took me  another  half  hour
to get to due to the difficulty of getting around the lake  (3  miles,  2600
ft, 3:00 hrs).

I quickly set up camp and headed for Sorcery at 1:15. I climbed steadily  up
the steep wooded W ridge working around  interesting  rock  formations.  The
snow deepened at I got higher, becoming knee deep in open areas.  I  carried
snowshoes, but they were of little use in the varying terrain  and  changing
snow depth. So I just postholed through the  deeper  areas.  The  worse  was
after reaching the false summit. It took almost 30 minutes to  make  my  way
from there to the summit on snowcovered boulders (.75 miles, 1400  ft,  1:50
hr).

I spent another 30 minutes looking for a cairn under the  snow  but  had  no
success.  I could not find one on the summit slab. I had fleeting  views  of
Big Snow Mtn to the E, but for the most  part  clouds  obscured  everything.
It was reassuring, however, to see the snowpack was  building  nicely  after
the parched summer. I was back to my tent in hour, quite damp from  slogging
through  and  under  wet  snow.  I  changed  to  dry  clothes  and  spent  a
comfortable night.

It began to snow lightly as I prepared to leave for  Galleon  Mtn  the  next
morning at 7:30. Galleon was not that far away as the crow flys - less  than
a mile - but first I had to get around the lake. Mountain  Lakes  can  be  a
real impediment to travel and this  one  was  no  exception.  Up  and  down,
bypassing cliffs, crashing brush, crossing gullies and creeks, it seemed  to
take forever and made me seriously consider if I really wanted to  continue.
At least the cold night hardened the snow so it was no  longer  so  wet  and
slushy.

From the NW end of the lake,  I  headed  for  the  tiny  pond  basin  SE  of
Galleon. Here 2 feet of unconsolidated snow covering a talus slope  made  it
worth lugging snowshoes along; they kept me from  sinking  into  treacherous
holes between the rocks. I stashed the snowshoes where the  slope  steepened
just below the notch in Galleon\'s NE ridge. It was now snowing heavily  with
a strong wind as I made my way to the notch. I only had 300 ft  more  to  go
but it took me over an hour to battle my way this last bit to the  top.  The
ridge was rocky, the snow deep and the wind gusts blew  snow  into  my  face
and covered my glasses so I couldn\'t see.  I  am  almost  blind  without  my
glasses (20/400) but this is one time I could see better with them off  than
on. I mostly stayed on the N side of the ridge where the wind was less,  but
the snow deeper, and literally excavated a trench thigh deep.  Twice  I  was
forced onto the S side where I could barely keep my eyes open  in  the  face
of the pelting snow and I was afraid my eyelashes would freeze together.  At
a rock step I had to remove snow to find solid footholds and  several  times
I wallowed through snow-laden trees using the  branches  as  handholds.  One
might wonder why I continued in the face of such difficulties. (1)  I  found
it a challenge to see if I could force my way upward in such conditions  and
was even enjoying myself in a perverse sort of way (2) I was  not  cold  and
did not feel overextended and (3) I am stubborn and don\'t like to give up.

In any event, I did make it to the summit at 11:45 (1850 ft,  4:15  hrs).  I
immediately turned around and started down. For the most part I was able  to
follow my trench down, but in the windy areas it was already obliterated.  I
also got off track once because without  my  glasses  I  can\'t  clearly  see
farther than my feet. I did two rappels off trees  (yes,  this  time  I  did
bring a rope) at steep sections rather than risk a snowy  slide.  Below  the
notch I had  trouble  locating  my  snowshoes,  as  my  uphill  tracks  were
completely gone, but did eventually find them and gratefully  used  them  to
the lip of the pond basin. I followed the pond outlet creek all the  way  to
the lake. From here it looked much shorter to continue  counterclockwise  to
camp than to return clockwise the way I  had  come.   The  problem  was  you
couldn\'t go that way due to impassible cliffs,  so  after  wasting  an  hour
finding that out I ended up going back clockwise anyway.

I dragged into camp at the incredible hour of 3:45 (2 miles, 2350  ft,  8:15
hrs.). I couldn\'t believe it had taken so  long.  My  tent  was  practically
buried in snow, I had to pack up  the  whole  sodden  mess,  I  had  no  dry
clothes left (although I still wasn\'t cold as long as  I  kept  moving)  and
there was a little over 1 hour of daylight left. I  jammed  everything  into
my pack, which felt as if it had gained at least 10 pounds in water  weight.
 I could barely lift the thing. I must admit I wasn\'t having a whole lot  of
fun at that point.

I managed to get down to the Dingford Cr Trail,  where  there  was  still  a
dusting of snow, before dark and staggered  out  the  rest  of  the  way  by
headlamp. A trip like this really makes you appreciate a warm shower  and  a
dry heated house.  In fact just my car looked pretty good to me  waiting  at
the end of the trail (3 miles, 50 ft, 2:15 hrs)

Total: 9.5 miles and 6400 ft in 2 days.

North Mtn (3840+ ft - 2200P - Darrington Quad) - November 21, 2005


I would really rather be skiing this time of year, backcountry  skiing  that
is, but only if the conditions are good. Since they  aren\'t  at  the  moment
what\'s a body to do? I have been known to snowshoe at  times,  but  only  if
desperate and only if I can\'t get to where I  want  to  go  any  other  way.
Instead I turn to mountain biking and search for summits I can cycle  up.  I
like the change of pace, the fact I don\'t have to wear a pack and of  course
the fast downhill run.

I am running out of low elevation 2000 Prominence peaks, but with  the  high
freezing level and warm sunny weather of the past week  I  thought  I  might
still be able to make it much of the way up this peak  before  running  into
snow. Most of the drive to Darrington was in the fog, but once in  town  all
was clear blue sunny sky. In keeping with my personal  standard  of  gaining
at least 2000 ft by bike in order for a 2000P peak to count (no  driving  to
the top), I parked just after turning off Hywy 530 (elev 500 ft), and  began
cycling up Road 28. It began as a narrow paved road, crossed  a  power  line
and entered woods before climbing a short steep hill. At  2.65  miles,  elev
1045, the pavement ended as I went right at a junction. Another steep  climb
and then the road gentled to climb the rest of  the  way  at  a  steady  but
bikeable rate. The warm sun and  the  views  of  the  snowy  north  face  of
Whitehorse and the multiple summits of Higgins made for  pleasant  pedaling.
Somewhere around 3000 feet I began running into mud and snow,  but  previous
vehicle traffic provided tracks to follow. At the 6th switchback, elev  3350
ft, all tracks stopped and any further progress by bike  was  impossible  in
the deep slushy snow and I stashed my bike (11.7 miles, 2850 ft, 3:40 hr).

Proceeding on foot, I began on an old spur road  off  the  switchback,  then
decided to head directly for the summit following my GPS, as the  road  took
me out of my way. The summit was little more than half a  mile  and  600  ft
gain away, but I was floundering through knee-deep slush and at the  rate  I
was going it could take the better part of a hour to get there.  I  followed
the S ridge to the summit area and encountered one of the  most  fascinating
geological features I have come across  on  a  low  forested  mountain.  The
entire area was riddled with many deep 10 to 15 foot clefts in the  bedrock.
Fascinating, but also a real impediment to travel as I made my  way  up  and
down and in and out of the holes casting around for  the  high  point.   The
slushy snow and numerous downed trees didn\'t help either. I finally  settled
on a summit (3315 ft, 4:40 hr) from which point I could look across  to  the
tower that graces the end of the main road.

By the time I made my circuitous floundering way back to my  bike,  darkness
was falling. I changed to dry socks (bike  shoes  are  not  very  waterproof
even with booties on) and bundled up for the  ride  down.  After  taking  it
easy on the first snowy and muddy section, I let her rip and zipped back  to
my car by the generous light of my  Nite  Rider  in  1:20  hr.  Total:  23.5
miles, 3315 ft and 7 hrs.

Following are two lesser summits I did earlier. One a bike ride  and  one  a
brush bash.


Haystack Mtn (2715 ft - 500P - Goldbar Quad) - November 17, 2005


For this bike ride I started from the intersection of Road 62 and  the  road
going up Haystack (Rd 6221), elev 1600 ft, turned right at the  junction  at
saddle in a recent clearcut and followed the deteriorating lumpy  and  bumpy
but gentle road as it made its way  completely  around  the  mountain  to  a
deadend on the W side, elev 2550. A  ten  minute  climb  on  foot  up  rocky
terrain led to the surprisingly pleasant open summit slab. A nice place  for
lunch in the sun with a good view of Mt Persis. Total: 7.2  miles,  1500  ft
and 3 hrs.

With time left in the day after I got back to the car, I  decided  to  check
out Pk 2740, a short ways farther on Road 62.  Rather than load  and  unload
the bike again, I cycled the 1.5 miles to the gate. After another 1.5  miles
I turned right and wandered around  logging  roads  looking  for  a  way  to
approach this peak from the S. I had fun biking, but I had no  luck  getting
close enough to the peak to easily climb it in bike togs.  I  was,  however,
very impressed with the appearance of this peak. For such a minor  low  peak
it is very steep on all sides and from the S is a rocky  forested  fin.   It
deserves to have a proper name. Additional stats: 11.3 miles, 765  ft,  2:20

Peak 2740+ (500P - Goldbar Quad) - November 19, 2005


Miffed that I didn\'t make it up this peak, I was back two  days  later  with
my son Walter. It was his 34th birthday and he wanted a short easy  but  new
climb. I suggested this. He didn\'t know what he was getting  into.   Neither
did I for that matter. We parked at the gate on Road 62, elev 1600  ft.  The
peak is directly W of the gate less than Â½ mile away.  It  looked  so  close
and so easy. Surely we\'d be up and down in a couple of hours. Well, it  took
almost 1.5 hours just to force our way through gosh  awful  brush,  stickery
vines and rotten logging slash with treacherous footing to the saddle  N  of
the peak. Then it took another hour to follow  the  steep  narrow  wooded  N
ridge to the top.  This ridge was mostly just steep dirt  and  moss  with  a
few vegetated cliffy steps but obstacles were everywhere and progress  slow.
I kept expecting Walter to complain, but he seemed to be  enjoying  himself.
Takes after his mother I guess.

There were no signs of previous travel. Surely no one else was crazy  enough
to climb this thing. Well, guess what we found on top? A film can  register.
The contents were mostly illegible, but I could  tell  there  was  only  one
entry made by Ian McKay and Dougal (I think) somebody. I  think  it  was  in
2001 and I think he claimed a first ascent, but I am not sure. He called  it
"Knob 2740".  Walter and I christened it "Birthday Knob" to commemorate  the
occasion if not the appearance of the peak. I do not recommend climbing  the
way we did, but it is still an impressive looking "knob", at  least  from  a
distance. Maybe it would be a better climb up  the  rocky  S  ridge.  Total:
Maybe 1.5 mile, 1290 ft and 5.5 hrs.

Jeff Pk (6217 ft - 537P - Noble Knob Quad) - December 1, 2005


Corral Pass is one of my favorite places to ski tour. Last  year  there  was
never enough snow in the area, so it  has  been  two  years  since  I  skied
there. I usually play around the basin below Castle Mtn or wander the  ridge
toward Mutton Mtn. With my new interest  in  checking  out  all  peaks  with
greater than 400 ft of prominence on Jeff  Howbert\'s  Master  Quad  List,  I
discovered this peak I hadn\'t climbed yet. (John,  does  this  peak  have  a
name?) A new peak that could be climbed on skis!  What could be better?

Despite recent lowland snow, Highway 410  was  clear  all  the  way  to  the
Corral Pass Road. Getting up this road, though,  through  8  inches  of  new
snow to the parking area at the gate (elev 3000 ft) required low range  four
wheel drive and was close to limit of what my Jeep  could  make  it  through
without chains. A snowmobile had been up the road the day before.   Perfect.
 I would have little trail to break.  Nor would I have to put  up  with  the
noise or smell of the infernal machines.

On the lower road there was no base under the new snow and I could feel  the
gravel underneath at times, especially where the snowmobile had  churned  it
up.  I would have to watch it on the downhill run to spare my  ski  bottoms.
Somewhere  around  5000  ft  the  snow  deepened  quickly  and  wind  drifts
increased trailbreaking. Even so I made it to Corral  Pass,  elev  5650,  in
good time (6 miles, 2700 ft, 2:55  hrs).  It  was  19  degrees  and  snowing
lightly, as it continued to do all day.

At the pass I left the snowmobile tracks  and  immediately  bogged  down  in
deep snow. Progress was slow and I began to wonder if I  would  run  out  of
daylight. I was able to follow the trail to Pt 5935,  then  went  along  the
ridge over Pt 6135 down to the saddle and up to Pk  6217.  The  terrain  was
lovely and ski friendly, just slow breaking trail. It took 2.5 hours  to  ski
the additional 2 miles and 1000 ft of elevation gain from Corral Pass.

The nice thing about skiing is the fast easy downhill run. It wouldn\'t  take
nearly as long to get out.  But first I had to climb the 200 ft back  up  to
Pt 6135.  I had taken my skins off at  the  summit  for  the  glide  through
gentle open woods to the saddle and elected not to take the time and  effort
to put them on again. My waxless base did not climb well in  the  cold  snow
and my downhill tracks were too steep to follow. But once up Pt 6135 it  was
all downhill.  Even so I did the last  bit  of  the  road  by  headlight,  a
surreal experience with dazzling dancing snowflakes distracting me.

I made  it  home  before  the  next  round  of  lowland  snow  made  driving
hazardous.

Total: 16 miles, 3900 ft and 8 hours.

Lost Ranger Pk (6176 ft - 456P - Noble Knob Quad) - December 7, 2005


I had so much fun skiing in the Corral Pass area last week that  I  returned
to ski up this peak, another new one for  me  that  I  had  previously  been
unaware of. I again started at the gate on the Corral Pass Road  (elev  3000
ft), but this time for variety I chose to ski up the  Deep  Cr  Trail.  This
saved me from repeating 6 miles of road skiing  and  got  me  closer  to  my
objective, but I doubt it saved much time or, particularly, energy.

A connector trail goes downhill from the gate for Â½ mile to cross  Deep  Cr,
joins the main trail on the other side and then climbs  4  miles,  sometimes
steeply, to the Noble Knob Trail below the S ridge of Lost Ranger Pk.  There
was barely enough snow cover in the dense woods to allow  skiing  at  first.
My skins protected ski bottoms from numerous protruding rocks.  Skiing  down
this trail would not be an option.

At the Noble Knob Trail junction (elev 5860 ft) the sign was still  visible,
but I was not able to follow this trail here in the now 2-3  foot  snowpack.
No matter, the terrain was open and I just headed uphill  toward  the  crest
of the ridge. The snow had consolidated considerably  since  last  week  and
trailbreaking was not a problem. I was surprised  to  come  across  a  rocky
section of ridge and traversed just below this interesting  cliffy  area  on
the W slope until I could easily gain the saddle just to SE of  the  summit.
From here it was a short gentle climb to the wooded top  (5.5  miles,  3500
ft, 4 hrs).

With time left in the day, I returned to the saddle SE  of  the  summit  and
decided to ski into the basin to the E. What a delightful run! The snow  was
perfect and untracked, the
turns effortless and had I not known I would have to climb back up  again  I
would have been tempted to continue on down toward Lost Lake. As  it  was  I
stopped at about 5600 ft and  then  contoured  and  climbed  through  lovely
benches to the Mutton-Lost Ranger saddle.  Since I had  taken  the  time  to
put skins on again, from here I just continued to the summit of  Mutton  Mtn
(6156 ft) where the views  were  much  better  than  from  Lost  Ranger.  Mt
Rainier was particularly spectacular silhouetted by the low  winter  sun.  I
could also see Jeff Mtn  where  I  was  last  week,  but  it  did  not  look
particularly impressive from this angle, as it was lost  behind  intervening
ridges.

I had another good run off Mutton to the Noble Knob  Trail  below,  which  I
followed to Corral Pass. The road was now packed solid from  the  snowmobile
traffic of the previous  weekend,  but  there  was  still  enough  untracked
shoulder to make for a pleasant schuss back to the car to close my loop.

Total: 14 miles, 4150 ft and 7:40 hrs.

Rampart Ridge SE Pk (5606 ft - 446P - Chikamin Pk Quad) - December 15, 2005


My original plan was to explore the logging roads up Mine and Hall Crs W  of
McClellan Butte on skis. However, I made it less than  a  mile  up  Rd  9020
(off I-90, Exit 38) when I lost traction with my Jeep  and  began  to  slide
backwards down the icy road (It didn\'t seem that slippery until I lost  it).
Believe me it was a helpless feeling  putting  my  foot  on  the  brake  and
having zero result.  S-C-A-R-Y!  I  had  my  hands  full  steering  the  car
backwards and keeping it on the road as I gained momentum, and I was sure  I
was going to end up going over the  side.  Miraculously,  somehow  my  slide
stopped. At that point, sobered and having learned my  lesson,  I  installed
chains, turned around and retreated.

Hoping to still salvage the day, I turned to my backup plan (to  climb  this
peak next to Mt Margaret) and  drove  on  to  Snoqualmie  Pass  and  the  Mt
Margaret Rd (elev 2500 ft). It was 15 degrees.  The road was  well  traveled
by snowmobiles, which broke  up  the  ice  layer  and  made  for  reasonable
skiing. At the 4th switchback, I headed N on the spur  that  goes  up  Rocky
Run. At the switchback at 3800 ft I continued straight along Rocky  Run  and
soon stashed my skis and switched to  snowshoes  (4  miles,  1650  ft,  2:30
hrs). Snow conditions and steep terrain were no longer conducive to skiing.

I crossed the outlet creek of Twin Lakes, turned right uphill and worked  my
way more to the right past cliffs.  Snow varied from crust to ice to  powder
depending upon exposure to the sun. At about 5000 ft I hit a steep icy  open
slope and reverted to boots and ice axe. Above this,  easy  slopes  led  the
final 400 feet  to  the  gentle  summit  (3400  ft,  4:40  hr).  Views  were
expansive of mountaintops, but valley fog was beginning to  form  again.  It
was 16 degrees on top with a chilly breeze and my water  bottle  was  frozen
slush.

Despite a late start made even later by my earlier misadventure, I  made  it
back to the car without needing a headlamp, but only because  the  ski  down
the wide smooth road was more  pleasant  than  expected  and  the  last  bit
paralleling I-90 was illuminated by the headlights of the traffic.

Total: 10 miles, 3500 ft and 7 hrs.

Peak 4973 (453P - Sun Top Quad) - December 20, 2005


I was in a quandary as to where to go  this  day.  Ice  storm  warnings  for
freezing  rain  ruled  out  all  the  passes  and  western  approaches.  Icy
conditions ruled out driving all back roads (I learned my lesson  last  week
after a long backward slide). That didn\'t leave a whole lot  of  choices.  I
ended up driving along 410 to Forest Road 72 and climbing this peak where  I
could start right from the highway (elev 2100 ft). The road  was  now  gated
for winter elk protection but not before traffic had turned  anywhere  tires
had gone into icy tracks.  In fact just turning around and  parking  I  slid
and slipped. But any untracked snow was soft and slushy. I  stubbornly  held
onto the unreasonable notion that I could still turn this into  a  ski  trip
despite much evidence to the contrary. I even had snowshoes in  the  car.  I
guess snowshoeing up roads is foreign to  my  nature.  In  retrospect,  just
walking would have been the best idea.

Skins worked very well on the icy track and I glided happily along in  light
mist. At the first switchback at 2800 ft I went straight  on  a  spur  road,
which was ditched and abandoned in less than a mile. After turning a  corner
into the Minnehaha Cr drainage onto a S exposure,  what  little  snow  there
was quickly vanished. By the time I came to a switchback (elev  3500)  at  a
major side creek, I was carrying  my  skis.  Here  the  "road"  deteriorated
completely and following it was no longer helpful. So I just  headed  uphill
on unpleasant loose scree, slippery steep muddy  dirt  and  ancient  logging
slash. Being shod in square-toed ski boots didn\'t help.  More  serious  rain
added to the fun. Oh the joys of winter climbing in  the  Pacific  Northwest
where temperatures,  freezing  levels  and  quantity  and  quality  of  snow
fluctuate all over the map. Nevertheless, the trek up was quite  interesting
as I worked my way past pinnacles and through cliff bands. At the top  of  a
gully (elev 4400 ft) I reached a spur ridge, crossed to the  N  side  and  a
gentler slope and wallowed in knee-deep slush the rest of  the  way  to  the
summit (4 miles, 2900 ft, 4:30 hrs). Many downed logs made skis unusable.

Not wanting to descend the way I had come up on the treacherous terrain  and
determined to still get in some skiing (why  else  carry  my  skis  up?),  I
dropped off the summit to the N (actually I had  to  go  S  first  to  avoid
cliffs, then N) to pick up a series of abandoned roads that  climbed  to  FR
72 high on Dalles Ridge. Once on FR 72 the skiing  was  reasonably  pleasant
(relative to what had gone before - all things are relative),  as  I  glided
along in the slow slush of old snowmobile tracks. But it was a very  long  7
Â½ miles back to the car. Once I hit old tire tracks (about  halfway),  slush
turned to ice and speed increased, but it was surprisingly not  bad  skiing.
Except for those few places melted out to  gravel  where  I  was  forced  to
remove skis, I was able to ski most of the way down.

Total: 13 miles, 3400 ft, 8:30 hrs.

Sawmill Ridge (5207 ft - 1047P - Lester Quad) - December 29, 2005


Coming off a week\'s illness I wanted something close,  short  and  not  very
difficult.  I have skied in the Greenwater area  for  years  and  yet  never
made it up to the high point of Sawmill Ridge, so this peak  seemed  to  fit
the bill. The trip actually turned out to be longer than  anticipated  as  I
had hoped to be able to drive farther than I was able (or  willing)  up  the
approach road, but it really didn\'t matter as I  also  felt  better  than  I
thought I would.

New snow overnight coated Road 70 with  several  inches  of  slippery  stuff
right from Highway 410 and made me nervous about going farther  up  Whistler
Cr on Road 7030 than about .3 mile (elev 2400 ft). I was surprised the  snow
level was so low here as this area is frequently in a micro banana belt.  It
did, however, take until the switchback at 3100 ft for the depth  to  become
reasonably consistent. By the time I reached  the  4200  ft  saddle  between
Whistler and Twin Camp Crs, I was breaking trail in a foot of almost  powder
snow (4 miles, 1800 ft, 1:50 hrs).

I turned left off the main  road  at  the  saddle  and  right  at  the  next
junction to follow the spur road that meanders up and  down  another  couple
of miles along Sawmill Ridge until I was at the 4700 ft  saddle  SW  of  the
high point. Here I left the road and climbed on the lee slope (to escape  an
increasing wind) to the left of the corniced ridge. This little peak  turned
into a pleasant surprise with a much more alpine summit than expected  (3200
ft, 4:15 hrs).

I managed a few turns down to the road, then climbed up Pt  5022  to  the  W
just so I could get in some more. A  pleasant  run  down  in  my  track  was
brought to a screeching halt after about Â½ mile on  the  main  road  when  I
came upon fresh tire tracks made by 4X4\'s at play. Darn!  I  guess  I  can\'t
really condemn them, after all it is a road and meant for vehicles  and  not
skis (even I would have driven farther if I had had more  guts).  Only  deep
snow or a gate keeps them out. I still had a good run on the shoulder  until
the melting snow lower down got so thin  (very  near  my  car)  that  I  was
forced to walk.

Total: 13 miles, 3650 ft and 6:45 hrs

Boise Ridge (3080 ft - 420P - Enumclaw Quad) - January 1, 2006


What better way to start the New Year than to climb a new peak, even  if  it
is a dinky little thing! Sure, I would rather be skiing, but I  had  neither
the time nor the energy. So with half a day and half the energy,  I  settled
for a bike ride. It turned into a very pleasant ride with pleasant  weather.
No rain, not a drop, and even some  sun.   Well  there  was  the  wind  that
almost blew me over, but you can\'t have everything.

I started from the Weyerhaeuser parking lot for  the  Griffin  Russel  Trail
System on Baldy Hill off 410 across from the old mill pond.  Since  I  would
be on private Weyerhaeuser roads, I figured I would have fewer  problems  on
a holiday.  Darned if I didn\'t still run into a truck patrolling  the  road,
but the guy was friendly and didn\'t mind me  biking.  He  said  I  could  go
anywhere I wanted.  However,  he  wasn\'t  Weyerhaeuser,  but  worked  for  a
logging company operating up the  road  and  was  checking  that  all  their
equipment wasn\'t being vandalized.

I followed the mainline road N and turned right at a  major  junction  after
3.2 miles. The gentle grade made for good pedaling until reaching the  final
2-mile spur to the top at 7 miles.  I passed several open gates, one  closed
gate and one downed tree across the road. I parked  the  bike  as  close  as
possible separately to each of the twin summits and hiked the final  100  ft
or so elevation to both.  My conclusion was the S  summit  was  higher,  and
both were a pain of dense trees and rotting  thinned  tree  slash.  But  the
bike ride was a real delight.

Total: 18.8 miles, 2260 ft and 5 hrs.

Pechugh Pk (5505 ft - 785P - Lester Quad) - January 3, 2006


It was back up the Whistler Cr Road (7030), where I was last week, to  climb
this peak across Twin Camp Cr from Sawmill Ridge. This time I  was  able  to
drive up the road to the switchback at 3100 ft,  considerably  farther  than
before. Snowmobiles had recently  been  on  the  road  so  I  had  no  trail
breaking as I stayed on 7030 all the way to the 4720 ft saddle W of  Pechugh
(3.4 miles, 1620 ft, 1:30 hrs). Here I was finally able to  do  my  favorite
thing in the winter world - make fresh tracks in powder snow. I  followed  a
road that switchbacked twice before dead-ending at 5200  ft,  from  where  I
climbed through pleasant open woods at  the  edge  of  a  clear-cut  to  the
forested summit (2400 ft, 2:45 hrs).

I had hoped to ski down from the  summit  through  the  clear-cut,  but  the
small Christmas-sized trees were too dense and the snow cover  too  shallow.
I was, however, able to cut across the lower switchback, although the  turns
were tight.  A couple more feet of snow would make for  a  great  run.  From
the saddle, I decided to climb Pt 5121  to  the  W.   This  peak  lacks  one
contour for 400 feet of prominence. A steep spur dead-ended at 4900  on  the
N slope.  The final climb to the top (2900 ft, 4:10 hrs) through all  manner
of obstacles was made worse by the fact that I had only kicker skins and  my
skis wouldn\'t climb very steeply.

I then unwisely tried to follow the ridge W  to  Colquhoun  Pk  (5173  ft  -
573P). It actually started  out  well  with  a  nice  open  ridge  but  soon
deteriorated to awful dense woods with inadequate snow cover to ski  easily.
I quickly bailed and dropped NW as fast as I could to pick up  the  approach
road and trail up Colquhoun. I have climbed this peak  many  times  on  skis
and it is one of my favorites. I couldn\'t pass up another  ascent  while  so
close (3700 ft, 6 hrs). Fortunately my kicker skins still  stuck  after  the
third application. From the summit it only took an hour to get back  to  the
car.

Total: 12 miles, 3700 ft and 7 hrs

Teanaway Ridge (4943 ft - 303P - Liberty Quad) - January 4, 2006


This turned into a very nice ski tour even though the  start  was  not  that
promising. Despite snowing heavily as I drove over Snoqualmie Pass,  when  I
arrived at the Iron Cr parking lot I found only a scant inch of fresh  stuff
over an icy rain crust created by the high snow level of the  previous  day.
Though not enough for good XC travel  down  low,  it  was  enough  for  good
gliding along the gentle Hovey Cr Road, and by the time I reached the  crest
of the ridge between Hovey Cr and Blue Cr it  had  increased  to  6  inches.
This made for wonderful XC travel along the ridge and over Pt 4217  until  I
intersected the Blue Cr Road  high  up.  This  road,  although  groomed  for
snowmobiles, was not yet tracked for the day and I had  2.5  miles  of  good
gliding to the final short ascent to  the  high  point  of  Teanaway  Ridge.
Rather than retrace my rather long and circuitous up route, I  then  made  a
direct descent down the ridge between Hovey Cr and the  West  Fork  of  Iron
Cr. Although the upper part was steep it was  better  skiing  than  the  map
might indicate. I picked up an old road on the ridge near Pt 4002. The  only
bad part was the short steep bit off the ridge to connect back to the  Hovey
Cr Road, as there was no longer enough fresh snow to cover  the  icy  crust.
Temperatures for the day were in  the  low  20\'s  with  sunbreaks  and  snow
squalls. 10.5 miles, 2700 ft and 7 hrs.

Enumclaw Mtn (2780+ ft - 420P - Cumberland Quad) - January 8, 2006


I have decided that biking up logging roads to a low and close-in summit  is
a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon  this  time  of  year.  There  is  no
logging traffic and I can begin at a  very  civilized  hour.  So  when  this
Sunday dawned with a break in the rain it was off to  give  Enumclaw  Mtn  a
try.  I get a great deal of pleasure out of  figuring  out  how  to  get  up
these minor 400+ ft prominence peaks listed on Jeff  Howbert\'s  Master  Quad
list with no prior information.  Just study the map, pick a route  and  hope
it will work out.  In the case of logging roads it is  a  matter  of  hoping
the roads shown on the maps are still bikeable  and  not  abandoned.   There
are often little surprises, but that is part of the fun.

There were no surprises on this trip, other than the  pleasant  one  that  I
could  drive  from  Cumberland  E  on  SE  Kuzak  Rd  all  the  way  to  the
Weyerhaeuser Mainline Rd.  I really thought it would be gated  before  this.
Saved me a few miles of biking. This is the same mainline  road  I  biked  N
from Highway 410 last Sunday to go up Boise Ridge. This time, starting  from
the closed gate (no intimidating signs, elev 1200 ft),  I  biked  S  on  the
Mainline, but only a few feet as I immediately turned  left  uphill  onto  a
road that climbed up the E side of the S Fork Coal Cr valley. At  2.6  miles
(elev 2275 ft) I turned right onto a side road. At first I thought  I  might
be in trouble as this road looked very little  used  and  I  was  afraid  it
might become impassible, but I needn\'t have worried, although I did have  to
dodge alder branches crowding the edges at times. I climbed to 2450 ft  then
descended to 2000 feet to cross the creek to the W side of the valley  in  a
series of ups and downs before climbing once again to hit a  major  road  at
6.5 miles and 2300 ft.  This road goes S to connect with the one I  took  up
Boise Ridge. At 7.25 mile I turned left onto the  final  Â¼  mile  spur  that
went to within 50 ft of the top. A rough trail circled around  the  backside
away from the road cut and a plastic rose marked the summit (2500  ft,  2:40
hrs).

I had a nice view of the Enumclaw plateau to the  W  with  all  its  strange
little bumps. It looked like the playground  of  a  family  of  busy  moles.
There are enough blobs  there  to  keep  a  body  busy  for  many  a  Sunday
afternoon, although some of them do not qualify for 400 ft of prominence.  I
was just below the snowline to E where several higher summits would have  to
wait until the snow melted. The trip "down" had more up than  I  would  have
liked but I made it back to the car just as the next  round  of  rain  began
again.

Total: 19 miles, 3350 ft and 4:20 hrs.

Despite extensive skiing in the Blewett Pass area I had never been up  Table
Mtn,  put  off  I  suppose  by  the  perception  of  it  being  overrun   by
snowmobiles. And it usually is, especially on  weekends  and  holidays.  Too
bad as it makes for a marvelous ski trip. Even more so on this day,  because
even though I expected to meet many of the smelly beasts, I  only  ran  into
two of them and that at the end of the day.  So I essentially had the  whole
place to myself. Add to that sunny weather with good  views  and  nice  snow
and I had the makings of a stellar tour.

The parking lot was empty when I started at 9:30.  Road  9716  was  recently
groomed and somewhat icy, but I found good traction in a  fresh  dusting  of
snow on the side. The road was very gentle and took forever to get  anywhere
but I happily glided in silence and solitude  the  easy  5.5  miles  to  the
junction with Table Mtn Road 35. This road was not recently groomed and  had
more fresh snow but trailbreaking was still not a problem. I  did,  however,
run into a dozen or so trees that  had  presumably  come  down  in  Sunday\'s
storm where winds in excess of 100mph were clocked in Wenatchee and  Mission
Ridge. They were easily bypassed. I doubt the snowmobilers will allow  these
trees to impede their access for long.

I left the road at its  high  point  and  skied  along  the  edge  of  Table
Mountain. I counted three closed contours of 6200  ft  along  its  almost  2
mile length on the map. Which one was the high  point?  I  didn\'t  know  and
really didn\'t care, as the plan was to ski the entire ridge anyway.  This  I
did and it was delightful skiing, as long I stayed in the trees  100  ft  or
so away from the edge where the wind was  howling  and  snow  flutings  made
travel difficult. My side trips to the high points were quick.   Good  thing
the wind was coming from the west or  I  might  have  been  blown  over  the
cliff.

Once at the south end of the ridge I returned  to  the  road  for  the  trip
back. I ran into the  two  snowmobilers  mentioned  earlier  very  near  the
junction with Road 9712 at the start of the downed trees.  I  informed  them
there were about a dozen more to contend with and they were  not  happy.  At
the junction myself, I decided to continue to the top of  Diamond  Head.   I
had never been there and it was so close. Near the top  it  was  very  windy
and I was forced onto the east slope to escape and find softer snow.

I had a good run down from the summit east to a saddle and down  a  drainage
where I soon picked up the Haney Meadow Trail. It  was  freshly  tracked  by
snowshoes. Skiing in snowshoe tracks is not my  favorite  thing,  but  there
was enough soft snow on the side for good skiing. The last bit was  done  by
headlamp. I hit the road about a mile from the Sno-Park.

Total: 16 miles, 3000 ft and 8 hrs.

January 12, 2006

I usually avoid the Crystal Springs SnoPark lot E of Snoqualmie Pass, as  it
is Snowmobile City. However, there is a lot of good skiing in  the  area  if
you can put up with the noise and smell of the  infernal  machines.   It  is
best to go during the week although even then you cannot get away from  them
completely. The one advantage is that during periods of heavy new  snowfall,
such as now, you will have little if any trailbreaking.

I started from the far end of the huge (and unplowed - I needed  my  4-wheel
drive just to navigate the foot of slush) lot where space is set  aside  for
skiers and dog sleds (elev 2400 ft).   Here  a  snowmobile  forbidden  trail
wanders through the woods a mile or  so  to  connect  with  the  Iron  Horse
Trail. Another mile of flat gliding along the set tracks and  I  turned  off
onto  the  Meadow  Cr  Road  5483.  Three  more  miles  along  this  groomed
snowmobile road and I turned left onto road 5484  to  cross  Meadow  Cr  and
start uphill (5 miles, 600 ft, 2 hrs). There had only been  a  dozen  or  so
snowmobiles in the lot when I started, but I think every one of  them  found
me and followed me like annoying buzzing mosquitoes I couldn\'t shake. I  had
to keep reminding myself I was in their territory so what did I  expect  and
at least I wasn\'t breaking trail.  For the distances I  was  going  on  this
trip there is no way I could make it on my own if  I  had  to  break  trail.
Still, a few moments of solitude would have been nice.

I soon took a right onto a spur road climbing toward Big Muffin.  This  road
was no longer groomed but a snowmobile had been up  it  so  I  still  didn\'t
have to break trail.  However, it was a mixed blessing  as  I  struggled  up
the resulting deep trench and the "moguls"  that  are  kicked  up  when  the
machines are powered through heavy snow. I  finally  left  all  traces  them
behind when I turned off the road to climb up the E ridge through  a  clear-
cut to the summit (2400 ft, 4:10 hrs). I had a pleasant run down the  clear-
cut and back to the saddle between Big  and  Little  Muffin.   Another  road
that snowmobiles had chewed up climbed with 2 switchbacks to  circle  around
to the S side of Little Muffin. A short trek through open woods led  to  the
flat summit where I wandered around a bit until  I  felt  I  must  certainly
have hit the highest point (3050 ft, 5:40).

It was now snowing heavily and windy, a blizzard really and I  could  barely
see a thing, which might actually have helped on the run down the chewed  up
road.  Why snowmobiles can\'t just  go  straight  up  a  road  I  will  never
understand, but they can\'t.  They must go up and  down,  in  and  out,  high
mark onto the uphill shoulder, cut across,  dig  deep  holes  and  generally
render a road unfit to ski. If I had been able to see all this  on  the  run
down I  would  have  been  very  intimidated.   Since  I  couldn\'t  and  was
essentially skiing blind I just kept it loose, bent the knees and  went  for
it.  Fortunately, the snow was soft and forgiving and I made it down to  the
groomed road in one piece. The rest of the 5+ miles of very  flat  road  and
trail took as long to go out as to come in. I arrived to a car buried  in  6
inches of new wet heavy snow, an effort to get out of the lot and a  tedious
drive over Snoqualmie Pass.

Peak 4080+ (600P - Stampede Pass Quad) - January 17, 2006




Still not completely recuperated from my  climb  of  Anthracite  and  Beaver
with Stefan, Paul and company on Sunday, I was looking for  a  wimpy  little
peak with  a  short  drive  that  I  could  do  on  skis  without  too  much
trailbreaking. This peak fit the bill as the most difficult thing  about  it
was locating it on the map. With only an elevation of 4080+ ft to go  by,  I
had to search all over the Stampede Pass Quad to find it. I  first  found  a
4080 ft summit close to Stampede Pass itself but  then  realized  it  didn\'t
have the proper prominence.  I finally found this curious low  bump  nestled
amongst much higher summits between Gale  and  Box  Canyon  Creeks  where  I
least expected it.

I began from the Kachess Lake SnoPark (elev 2400) fully  expecting  to  take
advantage of the groomed snowmobile roads to get me close to  my  objective.
Alas, I was the first to arrive at the lot for the day and just overnight  a
foot of heavy wet snow had fallen. As I  was  contemplating  my  misfortune,
two snowmobiles whizzed by me out of nowhere and proceeded up the road.   No
trail breaking for me after all, at least to start.

The road to start is very flat as it  wanders  along  the  edge  of  Kachess
Lake, but I glided happily  along  in  the  snowmobile  track  enjoying  the
freedom of motion skiing provides  (as  opposed  to  the  plodding  of  snow
shoeing, which I only tolerate as a means of  transportation).  I  even  had
magnanimous thoughts for the snowmobiles, which allowed for this  (they  can
be useful at times). After 2 miles the road began to climb along Gale Cr.  I
thought about approaching my peak more directly from the E, but  missed  the
spur road (it was untracked.) so ended up going another 3.5  miles  on  the
main road to a spur (elev 3480) going up  the  W  side.  Unfortunately  this
spur was also untracked. It also  maddeningly  went  down  a  bit  and  then
contoured for over a mile circling around  to  the  S  side  before  finally
climbing to the saddle between Pk 4080 and a 4040 ft knoll.  Breaking  trail
through deep heavy snow on these 2 miles took almost  2  hours.  The  summit
was a cute knob that even sported a small cornice (7.5 miles, 2100 ft,  4.5
hrs).

I made a few good turns off the summit despite the heavy snow and  continued
to the 4040 ft knoll.  From there I could look straight down onto  the  main
road. I couldn\'t resist a direct descent down the N  side  and  although  it
was quite steep with deep snow it wasn\'t bad skiing. The main road was  fast
going down as by now many snowmobiles  had  been  by.  Even  the  flat  went
quickly. This may be a wimpy peak, but wimpy peaks can  be  a  lot  of  fun,
especially on skis.

Snowshed Head (3796 ft - 356P - Stampede Pass Quad) and Lake Laura -
January 19, 2006

Snowshed Head doesn\'t have 400 ft of prominence and certainly doesn\'t  merit
a trip in and of itself.  Still, it is a named peak and was the last for  me
to do on the Stampede Pass Quad. So I had to climb it.   In  order  to  make
the trip worth my while I decided to combine it with a trip to  Lake  Laura.
I had never been to this lake.   I  also  wanted  to  see  if  it  would  be
possible to climb Dungeon Pk (5640+) via the E ridge from the lake.   I  had
already climbed Dungeon several years ago via the S ridge which looked  from
the map as if it would go entirely on skis.   It  did  not.   An  impressive
rock wall necessitated a 300 foot descent followed by a  climb  up  a  steep
gully to the NW.  Skis were left behind.

Starting from the Mt Margaret SnoPark (elev 2600 ft),  I  bypassed  Snowshed
leaving it till the end and skied to the switchback on  the  road  up  Rocky
Run, a repeat of my route up the SE Pk of Rampart Ridge of a few weeks  ago.
Donning skins, I continued upstream to the right of Rocky Run in the  trees.
 The left side of the creek was all cliffs and did not  appear  to  offer  a
reasonable route. The outlet creek from Twin Lakes was  more  of  a  problem
than the map would indicate.  It was a steep  rocky  ravine  that  was  best
crossed very low. A small cliff band with a waterfall  was  the  only  other
obstacle, but I found a way through that could be climbed on  skis.   Above,
an open slope led to a small spur ridge and a short descent to  lovely  Lake
Laura, elev 4400 ft. (2600 ft, 3:20 hrs)

The lake itself was mostly surrounded by cliffs but a  slope  on  the  other
side offered the possibility of a continued way up. With limited  visibility
I couldn\'t tell for sure. An attempt on Dungeon  from  here  would  have  to
wait for another day with better weather, better snow and  more  time.   But
at least I now knew I could get to the lake on skis.

My next destination was Twin Lakes, elev 4600 ft, nestled in a bowl N of  Mt
Margaret. I had been to these lakes on summer trail but  never  on  skis.  I
climbed out of Lake Laura and traversed upward  on  easy  terrain,  much  of
which crossed avalanche debris that had come down off the  steep  slopes  of
SE Rampart.  It took a bit less than an hour to get there. To  get  back  to
my start, from the lakes I was forced to climb to  over  5000  ft  to  avoid
very steep sidehill. Once past Mt Margaret, I took off skins, and  began  my
greatly anticipated downhill first through  trees  than  massive  clearcuts.
Fun, fun, fun.  Eventually I ended up on the main  groomed  snowmobile  road
and headed for Snowshed.

From Resort Cr Pond I was surprised to find a cat track went almost all  the
way up  Snowshed  Head.   Evidently  the  DOT  uses  this  summit  to  blast
hazardous snow above I-90 (It is directly  above  the  snowshed,  hence  the
name). I passed all manner of intimidating signs warning of the  possibility
of being blown to smithereens if one  proceeded.  While  on  the  summit,  a
groomer had come by on the snowmobile road, leveling out  all  the  annoying
rollers and ruts that snowmobiles make and allowing for  a  let-her-rip  run
down the road. But alas, I soon  caught  the  groomer  and  passed  it  (the
operator was somewhat shocked to see me). He passed me again on the flat.

Meadow Mtn (5440+ ft - 1840P - Lost Lake Quad) - January 24, 2006


Just because there is zero percent chance of rain  (as  there  was  on  this
day), that doesn\'t mean the weather, or particularly  the  snow  conditions,
will be good. I lost on both accounts this  time  out.   I  arrived  at  the
Crystal Springs SnoPark (elev 2400 ft) to thick fog  and  icy  crusty  snow,
but I was early enough to beat the snowmobiles. I repeated  my  route  of  a
few weeks before up Big and Little Muffin for the first 5  miles  -  up  the
ski trail, Iron Horse Trail and Meadow  Cr  Road.  My  waxless  skis  worked
marginally on the flat, but once on the road, despite it being  only  gently
uphill, I was forced to put on kicker skins to get any traction  at  all  on
the ice. Rather than continue another mile to the road  directly  to  Meadow
Pass, for variety I turned onto Road 5484 for a  short  ways  and  tried  to
take a shortcut to Stirrup Lake. But I couldn\'t find the trail and ended  up
wandering through close trees until I ran into a road that took  me  to  the
lake. From here I climbed through trees to Meadow  Pass,  elev  3640  ft  (7
miles, 1850 ft, 4 hrs). I don\'t think I saved  any  time  but  it  was  more
interesting than just slogging along the road.

From the pass I followed a road well tracked by snowmobiles  that  took  its
time climbing up the S side of Meadow Mtn through clearcuts. At 4000 ft  the
snowmobile tracks ended. The fog was  beginning  to  lift  with  tantalizing
glimpses of the sun and a few views, but I could see my summit was still  in
the fog with little hope for improvement.  There was also a very nasty  wind
from the SE with gusts strong enough to knock me off balance.  At  the  last
switchback, I abandoned my plan to climb the SW ridge and instead  traversed
straight into the trees onto the W  slope  to  escape  the  wind.  The  only
problem was this put me on a very steep sidehill. Still, it wasn\'t  too  bad
on skis as here the snow was mostly  soft  slush  with  a  slight  breakable
crust. I continued traversing N until I reached an open bowl  below  cliffs,
then traversed back S to the first place I could climb to the summit  ridge.
The last 200 feet were quite steep. I stashed my skis just below the  ridge,
emerged onto the crest to the full force  of  the  wind  and  punched  steps
through awful ice crust the remaining .2 mile to the summit (10 miles,  3900
ft, 6:30 hrs).  It seemed to take forever in the raging wind and  of  course
the summit was the farthest bump as it always is.

The ski back to the switchback was not as bad as I had anticipated, but  the
ski down the untracked road was treacherous. I could  stay  on  top  of  the
breakable crust as long as weight was evenly distributed between both  skis,
but put more weight on one ski and it would break through and down  I  would
go. I finally settled on a slow  thigh-busting  snowplow.   Things  improved
once I hit the snowmobile tracks, if only slightly.  I didn\'t break  through
a crust but the track was icy, fast and rutted. I stayed  on  the  road  all
the way to the groomed Meadow Cr Road. By now it was dark. The last 6  miles
were enjoyable as I rocketed down the smooth road on  any  slight  downhill.
Even the flat zipped by as here the snow had  softened  just  enough  during
the day for a good kick and glide.

Total: 20 miles, 4100 ft and 10 hrs.

Huckleberry Ridge (5000+ ft - 600P - Clear West Quad) - January 31, 2006


What a difference a few days makes! I found  myself  back  at  the  Sun  Top
SnoPark where Saturday I had a splendid trip to  the  lookout  with  Jim  in
gorgeous powder. All that beautiful fluff was now replaced by rained on  and
frozen crust. It was enough to make grown men (and women) cry. But  such  is
the life of a backcountry skier in the Washington Cascades, where the  cycle
of snow is constantly shifting back and forth between the  sublime  and  the
awful and you are never quite sure what you are going to end up with.

Actually I was happy that there was still enough snow, bad  as  it  was,  to
ski right from the car (elev 2300 ft). My  destination  this  trip  was  the
high point of Huckleberry Ridge, directly across  Huckleberry  Cr  from  Sun
Top. After 15 minutes on the main Rd  73,  I  turned  right  onto  Rd  7320,
crossed the creek and in another 15 minutes turned  left  uphill.  The  road
was very chewed up with old snowshoe and boot and ski tracks, but  soon  all
tracks ended  and  the  way  blessedly  smoothed  out  a  bit.  At  the  4th
switchback the road essentially ended with  both  spurs  shown  on  the  map
blocked. However, I was able to continue up the right spur despite it  being
somewhat overgrown and lumpy with downed trees and debris. This took  me  to
a side ridge where all road ended, elev 3880. Here I  had  a  last  view  of
both Sun Top and my objective as weather was fast approaching.

Fortunately, I was able to follow a narrow open thread through  dense  trees
along the crest of the side ridge until I hit a good road on the main  ridge
(elev 4200 ft). This road was delightful after what I had been  on.   I  was
now high enough for 2-3 inches of fresh snow since the last rain  and  there
was no sign of any traffic of any sort (I thought  maybe  snowmobiles  might
come up this way from the W Fork White River). I followed the  road  up  and
down along the ridge until it dead-ended in a clearcut  below  Haller  Pass.
From here I wandered to the top of the clearcut and through the trees  until
I could descend to the road and saddle just N of Huckleberry Ridge. A  final
clearcut, where skins were required once again (I had also used then on  the
side ridge), led easily to the high point (3450 ft, 5:15 hrs).  It  was  now
snowing hard and very windy.

There was enough snow over the crust on the clearcuts to  ski  down  safely,
just not enough for carefree turns, but the upper road  was  very  pleasant.
Then much side-slipping and crashing in breakable crust down the side  ridge
and overgrown spur road until I reached the lower road where by  now  enough
new snow had fallen to make it a reasonable ski down.  But  by  the  time  I
reached the car, the snow was already turning to rain as snow  levels  began
rising once again in a seemingly never ending cycle.

As an aside, I almost ran into a downed  tree  across  Highway  410  on  the
drive home. Fortunately I saw it in time in the dark and wasn\'t  going  that
fast.  Still it was scary!  I was  barely  able  to  squeak  by  it  on  the
outside shoulder.  It wasn\'t a huge  tree  but  it  would  have  done  major
damage had I hit it head on.

Greenway Mtn (4440+ ft - 440P - Chester Morse Lk Quad) - February 5, 2006


I have been waiting all winter for just the  right  conditions  to  do  this
trip. I needed enough snow to make the long road approach skiable,  but  not
so much that trailbreaking would be a problem or that the access  road  from
I-90 off Exit 38 would not be drivable. (The last time I tried this  trip  I
ended up sliding backwards down the road in my jeep.  I  gave  up  and  went
elsewhere.) This Super Bowl Sunday everything seemed  to  fall  into  place.
Even the weather was nice.

I was able to drive Rd 9020 this time with no problem. I ran into the  first
snow at the intersection with Rd 9021 and was stopped very shortly after  at
the power line, where I  parked,  elev  2000  ft.  At  the  next  very  soon
intersection I went straight ahead  on  a  gated  road  (gate  open  but  no
vehicle tracks).  Past the gate the road had 8-12 inches of base  snow  with
a dusting of fresh on top and made for good skiing right from the  start.  I
followed the "main" road as it took its time  and  meandered  up  and  down,
first into the Mine Cr Valley, crossed that  creek,  then  rounded  a  ridge
into the Hall Cr Valley and eventually switchbacked up to the ridge  marking
the boundary of the Cedar River Watershed. Parts  of  the  lower  road  were
rather overgrown and presented some obstacles,  but  other  than  that,  the
whole route made for very pleasant skiing. By the time I reached  the  ridge
there was 3-4 inches of delectable powder over a deep smooth base.   Perfect
conditions.

The ridge road came very near the summit of Greenway, and it  was  a  simple
matter to ski to the very top (7 miles, 3050 ft, 4:30 hrs). The day  was  so
lovely and  the  skiing  so  pleasant  that  I  couldn\'t  resist  adding  Mt
Washington (4400+ ft - 280P)  and  Change  Pk  (4320+  ft  -  320P)  to  the
itinerary.  I had been up both from the Mt Washington trail  in  summer  but
had never skied the ridge roads to them (the  final  ascents  were  on  foot
though). This made for a very long trip indeed but a  very  satisfying  one.
Who would have thought such a nice ski trip would be possible in this area!

Total: 20.5 miles, 4500 ft and 10 hrs.

I wanted something easy and close that would not require an early start  for
this day. I succeeded in the last two requirements but easy it  was  not.  I
always seem to overreach in what I think is reasonable for  a  certain  time
frame.  Or maybe it is just that I  am  perpetually  overly  optimistic.   I
would like to think it is the latter. In any event,  these  two  peaks  have
been on my radar screen for a while now. I knew that  there  would  be  snow
the last 1000 feet or so.  I considered waiting until  the  snow  completely
melted so I could bike the whole way, but by  the  time  that  happens  this
snowy year I will be on to bigger and badder mountains. So I decided to  try
a "bike and ski".  I have wanted to combine biking and skiing for some  time
but the difficulty of carrying skis on a bike always got in the  way.  Sure,
they could be carried on a pack, but skis  on  a  pack  can  interfere  with
biking (I know, I  have  tried  it).  What  I  really  need  is  folding  or
telescoping skis. Since those are not yet available,  I  came  up  with  the
idea of using kids cross-country skis.  These are  very  short,  very  light
and the simple binding can be used with any footwear, including bike  shoes.


And so I started at the gate at the end of  Kuzak  Rd  in  Cumberland,  elev
1200 ft, a little before noon on my bike with skis  and  poles  attached  to
the panniers. Past the S gate I turned left and went steadily  uphill.   The
day was windy, not unusual for this area, but nothing out  of  the  ordinary
had been predicted.  "Breezy", is what the forecast  called  it.  Well,  the
wind got steadily worse the  higher  I  climbed  until  it  began  to  be  a
hindrance in forward progress (Of course I was going into the  wind).   Then
I rounded the corner of a rib at about 2300 ft and entered  the  full  force
of what had to be a wind tunnel effect where the  wind  was  channeled  into
such speed that I literally could not  push  the  bike  uphill  against  it.
Gusts had to be 50-60 mph. I could only make  progress  between  the  gusts.
At this point I considered turning around, but you know me.   I  don\'t  give
up easily. Proceeding on the hope that I would get out of the  worst  of  it
after I got out of the "tunnel" I slowly continued up.

I did eventually get to a more protected area after passing through an  open
blue DNR gate and taking a left at the next road junction onto  the  N  side
of the spur ridge. Soon I began  running  into  snow  and  soon  after  that
stashed the bike at 2850 ft (4 miles, 1650 ft, 1:45 hrs). I continued on  my
little skis.  Conditions were perfect for these  little  guys,  soft  crust.
They climbed well yet didn\'t sink in very far. I think I was  able  to  make
faster progress on them than on my bike.  In 30 minutes I was  at  the  3040
ft saddle between the two peaks. I went N to  climb  Hudson  first.  A  road
traverses the E side and climbs all the way to the summit from the N, but  I
decided to chance a route up the shorter S ridge. Not a good choice. A  spur
road went up a ways then deadended in awful  scrub  trees.  Not  wanting  to
repeat that, when I finally made my way to the summit  (6  miles,  2500  ft,
3:15 hrs), I decided to come back down the road. It  took  a  while  to  get
used to the short squirrelly feel of my tiny  skis,  but  once  I  did  they
worked very well for the downhill run. You can\'t do any real skiing on  them
but for straight running up and down roads they worked fine.

Back at the saddle I went S following the road that  went  all  the  way  to
very near the summit of N Grass Mtn by traversing the W and then S  side.  I
was able to keep skis on to the very top (10 miles, 3600  ft,  5  hrs).  You
will notice that I haven\'t mentioned the wind again.   That  is  because  it
was no great problem even on the summits. Sure it was still very  windy  but
nothing really unusual for mountain ridges. I skied down the  2.5  miles  to
the saddle in 20 minutes and the  last  mile  to  the  bike  in  another  15
minutes (this section was flatter and slower). It was now dark but at  least
I had had the forethought to bring my good bike light.

I should have been down the 4 miles of good road on my bike  in  30  minutes
or less.  I should have been but I wasn\'t.  I had hoped the  wind  had  died
down by now where it had been so bad on the way up.  After  all,  it  wasn\'t
terrible on the summit.  How naÃ¯ve could I be?  When  I  entered  the  "wind
tunnel" not only was it not better it was worse. There was no  way  I  could
ride down that section and keep control of my bike.  One  gust  and  I\'d  be
down, or worse blown off the edge of the road. Even  walking  my  bike  down
was hazardous to my health. At the worse place  a  gust  hit  and  literally
picked both me and my bike up and hurled us into  the  shoulder  ditch.  And
while we were both down it continued to blow us  across  the  road.  I  have
never in my life been in such a strong wind.  It had to be in excess  of  70
mph. Several more times the wind blew us over  until  I  gratefully  rounded
the rib to relative shelter. I was so shaken, though, I  continued  to  walk
the bike for far longer than was probably necessary. It took  over  an  hour
to go the final 4 miles to the car.

Interestingly, the DNR gate was closed by the time I came down.  That  means
someone drove up and down the road.  I wonder how they fared  in  the  wind,
as it was strong enough to affect a vehicle.  In fact I  saw  a  wreck  just
over the edge in the area. Perhaps it was blown there.

The next day high wind warnings  went  up  for  the  foothills  and  reports
verified a 70mph gust in Cumberland.  A day late as far as I am concerned.

Total: 17.7 miles, 3800 ft and 7 hours.

I am eternally optimistic and constantly imagining  optimal  conditions  for
ski trips. They rarely materialize.  This  trip  was  no  exception.  Things
really looked promising when I left in the morning. There was  lowland  snow
with 2 inches at Granite Falls and cold temperatures. Surely there would  be
enough to ski on where I was going. Not so! Strangely, the farther  I  drove
up the Mountain Loop Highway, the less the new  snowfall.   By  the  time  I
reached the Schweitzer Cr Rd 4020, it had dwindled to a mere dusting.  Darn!
I should have gone to Snoqualmie Pass with its reported 8 inches  of  fresh.
But when I was making my decision as to where to go in the morning,  Hwy  18
was closed at Maple Valley due to a fatal accident. That is my  usual  route
to I-90. And so I headed N on I-405. I fared no better  here  where  traffic
was awful and added a full hour to the normal drive time.  But  it  was  too
late to change destinations.

I was able to drive 2.5 miles up Rd 4020 until being stopped  by  old  snow,
elev 2000 ft. The skiing was acceptable, with just enough  new  over  frozen
crust to give traction. Soon I took a right  onto  Rd  4021.  After  some  2
miles, I took a left to the Ashland Lakes TH. I was able to continue  skiing
until the old road turned to true trail. Then it became  obvious  that  skis
would be of no use.  The rest of the trip would be on foot.  The  trail  was
essentially a frozen creek  bed  with  slippery  planks  and  log  crossings
covered with icy snow.  Crampons would have been the order of the day had  I
thought to bring them along.  Since I didn\'t, I had to  make  due  with  ice
axe and ski pole axe and put up with a lot of slipping and sliding.

Above Ashland Lake I had trouble following the Bald Mtn Trail  and  wandered
around a bit going up and down in confusing topography.  Eventually  I  made
my way to Bald\'s NW ridge and followed it to the wooded summit  (5.3  miles,
3200 ft, 5 hrs). The terrain in this area would have been very  skiable  had
only the conditions cooperated. Too bad I didn\'t hit it right. I had  a  few
good views through the  trees  from  the  top.   Of  especial  interest  was
Fletcher Pk where I had just been two days previous.

Back at the Ashland Lake Junction, I made  a  mad  dash  up  Pk  3440,  just
beating darkness (.8 miles, 500 ft, :50 hr RT). The rest of the way out  was
by headlamp. A nice trip really, just not what I had imagined or hoped for.

Total: 11.4 miles, 4000 ft and 9:30 hrs

The area S of I-90 and E of Stampede Pass had never much  interested  me  in
the past, and with good reason.  It is  essentially  one  gigantic  clearcut
with  roads  everywhere,  overrun  with  snowmobiles  in  the  winter   (and
motorbikes in the summer).  But  with  my  current  pursuit  of  all  things
greater than 400 ft of prominence  and  new  summits  to  seek  out,  I  see
everything in a different light. The snows of  winter  can  lend  beauty  to
even the ugliest clearcut and if you hit it right, when  snowmobile  traffic
is low, skiing can be remarkably good.

I hit it just right on this trip. There  was  only  one  other  rig  in  the
Crystal Springs Sno-Park  (elev  2400  ft)  when  I  arrived  and  the  cold
temperatures (it was 12  degrees  to  start)  had  preserved  the  last  new
snowfall of several days ago. I was able to ski on the shoulder of Rd 41  in
1-2 inches of lovely sparkling powder and the miles of  road  skiing  ticked
by pleasantly enough. Soon I was passed by two snowmobiles  (from  the  rig)
and shortly after by one more going to Stampede Pass.  But that was  it  and
I didn\'t even hear any more for the rest of the day. A real rarity for  this
area.

I followed Rd 41 to the saddle N of Pk 4506 from where I headed  S  up  open
slopes to the summit (7 miles, 2250 ft, 3:50 hrs). Views were fantastic  all
around. Close by to the NW I was impressed by Meadow Mtn, which  stands  out
in a land of rounded summits. I was also interested in the  area  to  the  S
and E, a vast unexplored area for me with new summits  just  begging  to  be
skied (such as Cabin Mtn, Cole Butte and Snowshoe Butte).

The ski off the summit back to the saddle was fantastic with 3 inches or  so
of delectable dry powder over a frozen base. This was only  so  because  the
open clearcuts collect maximum snow and because the terrain is  gentle.   On
steeper terrain, edges wouldn\'t hold  on  the  underlying  crust,  but  here
turning was effortless and a  sheer  delight,  as  long  as  I  avoided  old
snowmobile tracks.

Clearly this was turning into a stellar ski  day,  one  that  needed  to  be
prolonged as long as possible.  With that in mind,  I  first  ambled  up  Pt
4873 before making my way to Pk 4898 (10  miles,  3550  ft,  6  hrs.),  then
skied more entrancing terrain to the radio  towers  at  4520  ft.  From  the
towers I skied N along the ridge until hitting  one  of  the  few  remaining
stands of trees around. Since skiing in the trees was not good, I  exited  W
down another clearcut until I picked up a spur road that led back to Rd  41.
From the Stampede Pass junction on the road had been newly  groomed,  and  I
whizzed smoothly down the last bit by headlight. I am constantly  amazed  at
how often and how well these snowmobile roads are groomed.

Total: 17 miles, 3850 ft, 9 hrs.

Wiley Ridge (4200+ ft - 840P - Mallardy Ridge Quad) - February 19, 2006


This peak has been nagging at me ever since I  had  to  miss  Paul  Klenke\'s
trip due to illness back in December. I had planned  on  staying  home  this
weekend, but I couldn\'t resist taking advantage of the beautiful sunny,  but
cold, weather. This seemed the time to lay "Wiley Coyote" to  rest.  (Coyote
Pt is what Paul calls the true summit.)

Armed with Paul\'s TR, I began on the gated road, elev  1300  ft,  just  past
the Red Bridge on the N side of the Mountain Loop Hwy. After  1.2  miles  on
the road, just past the bridge over Gordon Cr  I  found  the  old  overgrown
road, just where Paul said it was.  I followed this road easily  another  .7
mile to the deep ravine,  also  mentioned  by  Paul.  Seeing  no  particular
reason to cross the thing, I headed uphill to the right of it  crossing  the
switchbacking road 3 times. I briefly tried following the road, but  it  was
now so overgrown that it offered no advantage to travel. I continued  uphill
on a slight rib through reasonably pleasant open woods, although there  were
many  large  downed  trees  to  avoid.  The  ground  was  frozen   but   not
particularly slippery.

I began running into crusty snow about  2800  ft,  and,  after  an  annoying
section of thick scrubby trees, put on crampons and got out the ice  axe  at
3400 ft. The final 600 feet to the SE ridge was quite  steep  on  very  hard
snow and I  found  myself  frontpointing  at  times.  A  cliff  at  the  top
necessitated a short traverse to the right to hit  the  ridge  at  4000  ft.
From there it was an easy climb along the crest or slightly to the right  to
the first, false summit (3000 ft, 4:15 hrs).

I thought I had it made, but Wiley Coyote had a few tricks  up  his  sleeve,
as he frequently does. I knew there was  one  short  exposed  section  where
Paul recommended a long sling for protection. Instead  I  brought  a  40  ft
rope.  I wish I had brought a longer one (for rappels).  I  continued  along
the crest of the ridge until I came to a short snowcovered rock  step.   Was
this the problem spot?  Whether or not, it came  me  trouble.  I  roped  up,
fiddled around wasting time, finally got  up  the  thing  and  discovered  I
still had a ways to go to the summit. So I had to go back and  retrieve  the
rope and waste more time. I tiptoed farther along  the  narrow  snowy  crest
until coming to a final short steep mostly  snowcovered  cliffy  section.  I
was able to get up this by frontpointing after which I found myself  on  the
bare summit with a glorious view of  Three  Fingers,  Liberty  and  Fletcher
(3200 ft, 5:30 hrs).

I never did quite figure out where the exposed spot Paul  referred  to  was,
but my conditions were  very  different  from  his.  Anyway,  I  had  enough
problems of my own. I was nervous descending  from  the  summit  and  did  3
short 20 ft rappels.  I also rappelled the first rock step.  I  backed  down
much of the steep snow below the ridge. Then  I  got  off  my  uphill  line,
descending slightly farther W. This was not all bad.  The  woods  seemed  to
have fewer obstacles on this line and I missed  most  of  the  dense  scrub.
But this put me on the wrong side of the ravine on the lower road and I  had
some trouble crossing. Despite my delays, slow pace and  non-early  start  I
still made it down before dark (barely).          Total: 5.5 miles, 3500  ft
and 9 hrs.     Fay Pullen

Cabin Mtn (4980 ft - 1060P - Blowout Mtn Quad) - February 21, 2006


One of the side effects of pursuing lists is that it  takes  you  to  places
you otherwise wouldn\'t think to go. If not for climbing 400P peaks  I  would
never even have considered coming here, and it turned out  to  be  a  little
gem of a ski trip. Yes, it is in the heart  of  snowmobile  country,  but  I
only ran into two of the machines on the main road (on  the  other  side  of
Cabin Cr coming from Crystal Springs), and found no evidence of them at  all
on the mountain itself. And with less than ideal snow conditions,  being  an
all road trip (except for the very last bit) was an asset.

From Exit 71 on I-90 at Easton I followed Cabin Creek Road about 3 miles  to
its plowed end at the so-called "Easton Reload" Sno-Park, elev 2250  ft.   I
didn\'t even know this Sno-Park existed. It is obviously not as well used  as
the huge Crystal Springs Sno-Park off Exit 62 as I had  the  entire  lot  to
myself all day. Of course this was a weekday.

From the Sno-Park, I skied along groomed Rd 41 a long mile  to  a  junction.
The main groomed road went straight, while  Rd  41,  now  closed  due  to  a
bridge out, went right. However, innovative  snowmobilers  had  installed  a
bridge of their own across Cabin Cr giving them through  access  to  Crystal
Springs and environs. This section of the abandoned road  was  not  groomed.
After another 2.5 miles, I turned right onto the spur  road  up  Cabin  Mtn,
elev 2900 ft. I climbed 2000 ft on this road up  ever  increasing  appealing
terrain until just S of the summit. The  last  200  ft  was  a  steep  climb
through icy woods to the top (2900 ft, 4:15 hr)

It had been snowing lightly all day, but only put down an inch or so of  new
snow over a hard crust. This was enough for a pleasant ski  down  the  road,
but not enough for good skiing off road. However, with  better  snow,  there
are all kinds  of  possibilities  for  exciting  downhills.  A  return  trip
someday is certainly warranted. As I descended, the  snow  turned  decidedly
wet and wetter until it became just plain  old  rain.   What  was  going  on
here? The snow level was supposed to be  1000  ft.  No  way!   It  was  even
raining when I returned over  Snoqualmie  Pass.  The  recent  artic  air  is
certainly a thing of the past.

Total: 15 miles, 3100 ft and 7 hrs.

Cole Butte BM (5504 ft - 1504P - Easton Quad) - February 28, 2006


This turned out to be another hidden gem in snowmobile country, even  better
than my trip last week up Cabin Mtn.  I began from the same Sno-Park at  the
end of the plowed Cabin Cr Rd, elev 2240 ft. Again, I had the lot to  myself
and neither saw nor heard any snowmobiles all day,  although  a  couple  had
recently been part way up the road. The light  precipitation  to  start  was
closer to rain than snow and there was maybe an inch of wet new  stuff  over
a rained upon snowpack, which made for good waxless ski traction.

This time at the main junction at 1.5 miles, I turned left and followed  the
road up along the W side of Cole  Cr.  As  I  climbed  the  temperature  got
colder, the snow better and weather worse. By the time I  reached  the  head
of the valley, it was snowing hard, the wind was howling and all  traces  of
old snowmobile tracks had vanished under some  6  inches  of  fresh  blowing
snow. I continued around the head of the valley to the E side following  the
road through clearcuts until the uphill slope gentled enough  that  I  could
enter the woods and begin to climb to the ridge just S of Cole  Butte.   The
initial woods were very pleasant but soon steepened, and a final  open  area
below the ridge was wind blasted down to bare crust.  I  struggled  up  this
last section. Once on the easy ridge it was again very nice  as  long  as  I
traveled beneath the cornice line on the lee slope.  I  topped  out  on  the
summit to high winds and foggy views (3350 ft, 5 hrs).

The ski down to the road was tricky with  unfriendly  steep  snow  requiring
much sideslipping, traversing and kickturning, but  I  did  manage  to  stay
upright - mostly. The weather was now beginning to clear with  better  views
(all photos were taken on the way down) and  I  could  see  the  surrounding
terrain. With the high point of Cole Ridge (which did  not  offer  the  best
skiing in the area) out of the way, I could see all kinds  of  possibilities
for quality skiing on future tours.

Total: 13 miles, 3550 ft and 8 hrs.

Cole Butte (5502 ft - P422 - Blowout Mtn Quad) - March 2, 2006


I was going to go to Swauk  Pass  and  ski  up  Tronsen  Meadow,  but  while
driving past Easton conditions looked really good  -  blue  skies,  sunshine
and fresh snow. I also had the added incentive of a new  peak  to  climb  in
the area. So why drive another 45 minutes?  Two days ago I skied up  what  I
thought was the only prominence point on Cole Ridge.  After sending  out  my
TR, JR replied with his report from August of last year and I  discovered  I
had somehow missed a second peak on the ridge, probably because it was on  a
different quad. Cole Butte is a  long  horseshoe  ridge  with  "Cole  Butte"
(5502 ft - P422 - Blowout Mtn Quad) on the W side and  "Cole  Butte  BM"  or
"Old King Cole" (5504 ft - P1504 -  Easton  Quad)  on  the  E  side.  I  had
climbed the latter two days ago.  The funny thing  is,  I  remember  reading
John\'s TR last summer, but it didn\'t  register.  I  was  busy  at  the  time
pursuing bigger and higher peaks.

It really didn\'t matter that I wasn\'t aware of the  second  peak,  as  there
was no way I could have climbed both on the same day. It  just  gave  me  an
excuse to return sooner than I had planned to a delightful area.  This  time
I followed the road some 5 miles to the head of  Cole  Cr  valley  and  then
climbed up ski friendly terrain through a wide open clearcut to  the  saddle
below Pt 5361. I then bypassed Pt 5361 on the left and went over Pt 5449  to
follow the ridge to Cole Butte.  This ridge  was  all  in  woods  but  still
pleasant skiing. The summit was a small open area, with  limited  views,  in
the sun and thus made for a comfortable stop (3600 ft, 4:30 hrs).

Slopes exposed to the sun had already developed a breakable  crust.   Slopes
in the shade still held 3-4 inches of very nice powder. You can guess  which
I sought out to provide a very nice ski down the clearcut.  There  are  many
more clearcuts that I could see on my way down  that  will  warrant  further
explorations.  I am not yet done with this area.

Total: 14 miles, 4100 ft and 7:30 hrs.

Twin Peaks (5325 ft - P1165 - Lake Philippa Quad) - March 5, 2006


I have wanted to climb Twin Peaks ever since seeing it years ago  from  Goat
Mtn.  But I just never got to it, put off I  suppose,  by  tales  of  horror
from others who had climbed or attempted it.  So when Stefan  came  up  with
this as one of his trips, I jumped at the chance even though things did  not
look all that appealing to start. The weather was not promising,  I  had  my
doubts about Stefan\'s choice of route and way too many people showed up  for
this usually solitary soul. Well, the weather turned out  much  better  than
expected and the route turned out to be downright  pleasant  (you  amaze  me
Stefan with your innovative routes).  But, surprisingly,  the  best  for  me
turned out to be the people.  I think  we  have  the  best  group  of  like-
minded, obsessed, crazy,  interesting,  supportive,  competent  peak-baggers
going.  I enjoyed the company of each and every one of you. It was my  first
trip with Juan, Dave and Grant, but hopefully not my last. It was  great  to
again see Mitch, after a much too long absence, and  Jeff,  Greg,  and  Don,
even after recent trips together. Ian, I admire  your  perseverance.  Stefan
and Paul - this is getting to be a habit, but a good one.  And  Annette,  we
are just getting started.

Peak 5528 (P1248 ft - Mt Wow Quad) - March 7, 2006


For a change of pace I headed S to ski up this peak  above  Lake  Christine.
Just before the Nisqually Entrance to Mt Rainier I turned left  onto  Rd  59
and drove some 2.5 miles until stopped by  snow  at  elevation  2960  ft.  I
skied the road another 1.5 miles before turning right onto Rd  5920  leading
to the summer TH for Lake Christine. I had hoped  to  find  a  skiable  line
directly up the drainage to the lake but  nothing  really  looked  appealing
and I ended up going all the way to the end of the  2-mile  road.  This  was
not a wise plan as I was unable to find and follow  the  trail  and  had  to
drop to avoid very steep sidehill, cross the outlet creek  and  struggle  up
unfriendly terrain to the lake. However, once at the lake it was easy  going
to the W ridge and I was able to ski along this to the very top (3000 ft,  5
hrs).

The weather throughout the day was off and on snow showers, quite  heavy  at
times, mixed with periods of partial clearing where the sun  almost  put  in
an appearance but views did not. I am sure there is a splendid  view  of  Mt
Rainier, or at the very least Mt Wow directly across  Goat  Cr,  but  I  saw
none of it. The amount of new snow varied from a couple  of  inches  at  the
start to nearly a foot on top and for the most part it  was  the  usual  wet
heavy Cascade Concrete.  I had to get above Lake Christine for  it  to  even
begin to resemble anything like powder.   The  temperature  never  got  much
below freezing; even on the summit it hovered around 32 degrees.

I was not going to descend my ascent route to Lake  Christine,  and  instead
sought out a direct route down to the road, but I must  say  I  didn\'t  fare
much better.  The terrain is steeper than it  looks  on  the  map  with  all
manner of thick trees, gullies  and  obstacles.  There  are  some  appealing
clearcuts below Mt Beljica, but they don\'t really get  close  enough.  There
seems to be no good way to get to Lake Christine, at least not on skis.

I spent much of this trip, while slowly plodding through heavy new snow  and
laboring through obstacles, reflecting on  the  pleasant  experience  of  my
recent climb of Twin Peaks, lamenting the lack of  companions  on  this  one
and wishing I had a Dave Creeden along to break trail for me  and  a  Stefan
to find me a good route. And how about a Paul who can write  an  interesting
report for any trip?

Total: 9 miles, 3000 ft and 7.5 hrs.

Cross Under Butte (3945 ft - 465P - Blowout Mtn Quad) - March 10, 2006


I woke up to an inch of snow on my front lawn. This after  a  huge  dump  of
snow in the mountains the day before (I stayed  home  that  day  because  of
high avalanche danger and terrible driving  conditions  over  and  near  the
passes.)  I thought maybe conditions would finally be just right for  skiing
up the Mt Teneriffe Rd.  This road makes a  very  nice  ski  trip  but  only
comes into condition once every few years when snow  levels  are  very  low.
Things looked promising as I drove over Tiger Summit where there was  enough
snow to ski (and a jack-knifed semi) but as I descended to  North  Bend  all
snow suddenly disappeared. The  Mt  Teneriffe  road  itself  was  completely
bare. There was plenty of snow higher up but it looked as if  I  would  have
to walk the gated road about a thousand feet to get to it, not how I  wanted
to squander this fresh snow day.

On to Plan B. The drive over Snoqualmie was completely clear with  the  road
just bare and wet - what a difference a day makes - but I felt certain  that
if I went somewhere I had to break my own trail it would be  exhausting  and
I wouldn\'t get very far. It is either feast or famine - not enough  snow  or
too much. So it was back to my newfound Easton Sno-Park where  I  could  get
an assist from snowmobile tracks. Again, no one was  in  the  lot  but  sure
enough  the  road  was  freshly  tracked.  (Just  when  do   these   phantom
snowmobiles go out - in the middle of the night?)

I easily skied 4.5 miles up Rd 41 in the tracks, past the major junction  of
Rd 4110 up Log Cr, to an untracked spur road climbing the NE side  of  Cross
Under Butte. I slowly broke trail  through  delicious  powder,  deciding  to
first climb Pt 3920 (just for fun and to extend the  day)  and  sticking  to
the road the whole way so I wouldn\'t have to skin up. I then had a  pleasant
ski straight down the clearcut to the saddle before climbing along a forest-
clearcut interface, sticking to the woods as  much  as  possible  where  the
snow was not as deep, up the NW ridge to the top of Cross Under Butte  (2350
ft, 4:45 hr).  I had another fun run down to my tracks on the spur road  and
then a long glide out. All in all a good day of skiing  after  a  heavy  new
fall of snow.

Total: 13.5 miles, 2650 ft and 7:15 hrs.

Psilocybin Hill (5130 ft - 530P - Lost Lake Quad) - March 16, 2006


This peak has been on my to-do  list  ever  since  climbing  Meadow  Mtn  in
January.  The surrounding terrain is very appealing for skiing, but it is  a
L-O-N-G ways in and the summit itself is in the Cedar River Watershed, so  I
kept putting it off waiting for longer days and the  proper  motivation.  It
might have been smarter to put it way off until the roads melted out  and  I
could drive closer, but I am not well known for  doing  things  the  easiest
way. Beside I thought a stealth visit into  forbidden  territory  under  the
cover of extensive snow and bad weather  would  stand  a  better  chance  of
being undetected. (Why extensive logging is allowed  in  the  watershed  and
not such low impact activities as hiking, biking and  skiing  is  beyond  me
but that is a whole debate in itself and I doubt such reasoning  would  have
much sway with a judge if I were caught.)

Beginning from the Crystal Springs Sno-Park (elev 2400  ft),  I  skied  mile
after mile after mile on ski trail, the Iron Horse Trail, Meadow Cr Rd  5483
and Meadow Pass Rd reaching the 3600 ft pass at 7.75 miles  in  3  hrs.  Some
people might find such a long, relatively flat (1350 ft  gain)  road  to  be
positively boring.  Not me. The  old  reasonably  smooth  snowmobile  tracks
covered with a dusting of fresh snow made for very  pleasant  and  efficient
striding. I just love the feel of a gliding ski underfoot  and  the  freedom
of movement it provides.  I can (and did) do it all day long, as long  as  I
can do it at my pace.

From Meadow Pass I turned right traversing around the S ridge of Meadow  Mtn
and following a drainage to the saddle between Meadow Mtn and Pt 4953.  Here
I picked up a road coming from the watershed and entered. In my defense,  no
signs were visible, probably buried under feet of snow. This whole  area  is
one clearcut after another. So it was a pleasant surprise to find  a  lovely
glade of open woods on the broad top of Pt 4953.  The  trees  preserved  the
powder snow and made this section A+ skiing.  I  made  my  way  through  the
glade to the SE ridge of Psilocybin. I hugged the edge of the  forest  along
the ridge (the  SE  slope  was  all  clearcut)  seeking  better  snow  until
reaching the main NE ridge. Here the snow was  so  windblown  and  fluted  I
left skis to kick steps up the last 200 ft to the top (11.75 miles, 3200  ft,
5:45 hrs).

I had some nice skiing downhill in the powder in the woods.  And  the  roads
were all in perfect condition for  carefree  downhill  sliding  or  gliding,
soft and untrenched. I met no snowmobiles all day. A very satisfying day  on
the snow.

 I only have one more peak on the Lost Lake Quad, but it is very far  inside
the watershed, too far for a winter trip, I think, so I am not  sure  how  I
can get to that one undetected. I also had an intriguing  view  of  a  tooth
like peak to the SW I later identified as Goat Mtn (Findley Lk  Quad).  This
is in the Green River Watershed  (Tacoma),  which  doesn\'t  seem  to  be  as
officious as the Cedar River Watershed (Seattle) so there is hope I can  get
up that one.

Total: 23.5 miles, 3700 ft and 9:30 hrs.

Snowshoe Butte (5135 ft - 1495P) and Bearpaw Butte (4800+ ft - 280P) -
Blowout Mtn Quad - March 31, 2006

I knew this would be another long road ski trip, but I didn\'t  know  exactly
how long. That was probably just as well or I might have  been  discouraged.
Sometimes ignorance is best. I tried for an early start but I was  sabotaged
by a terrible traffic jam at the  I-90  Hwy  18  interchange  caused  by  an
overturned flatbed semi (no doubt he took the exit ramp too fast). Not  only
did I lose precious time but I also arrived at the Crystal Springs  Sno-Park
frazzled and too late to beat the snowmobiles.  Thankfully  there  were  not
that many and for the most part they were not going where I was going.

It felt good to have snow underfoot again after a week of hiking in  parched
New Mexico. The snow was in excellent soft spring  condition  and  made  for
pleasant skiing mile after mile. The weather was warm  enough  to  start  in
shirtsleeves, with light rain/snow/hail showers at times. I began on Rd  41.
At the junction to Stampede Pass I took a  higher  spur  road,  through  two
sets of power lines, that eventually deadended below the wooded  ridgecrest.
I climbed to the ridge and followed it S until I ran into another road  that
traversed clearcuts around the W side of Pk 4898 before it ended as well.  I
followed the ridge through another wooded section until  reaching  the  last
saddle and open slopes below Snowshoe Butte  for  the  final  climb  to  the
summit (8.5 miles, 3200 ft, 4:50 hrs).

I descended the S ridge down good ski terrain to  intersect  the  connecting
ridge to Bearpaw Butte, following this  up  and  down  to  that  summit  (10
miles, 3700 ft, 5:45 hrs). I was now a very long distance from my start  and
the question was how to get  back  without  gaining  or  losing  unnecessary
elevation. I certainly didn\'t want to return  over  Snowshoe  but  the  deep
drainage of Cabin Cr was in the way of a direct route. I could  descend  the
NE ridge of Bearpaw directly to Rd  41,  however  at  that  point  the  road
dropped to 3200 ft to cross Cabin Cr and I would have to climb  back  up  to
4000 ft to get around Cross Over Butte. Not appealing. I could  see  a  road
that seemed to contour the E side of Snowshoe above Cabin  Cr,  if  I  could
get to it.

I returned along the ridge toward Snowshoe until I was able to descend  open
cleacut slopes to the N side of Cabin Cr and pick up the road  I  had  seen.
This I followed several miles until I could regain Rd 41 at the saddle N  of
Cross Over Butte. Now all  I  had  to  do  was  follow  this  well  traveled
snowmobile road back to Crystal Springs. It was  getting  late  enough  that
the road surface was beginning to ice over but this was actually helpful  as
the otherwise the gentle road would have been very slow.  I  ended  up  only
needing my headlamp for about the last half hour.

A last thought: does it count to climb Snowshoe Butte on skis? Somehow  that
doesn\'t seem quite right. I suppose I could rename it "Ski Butte"  but  that
lacks pizzazz.

Total: 21.5 miles, 4400 ft and 9:20 hrs.

Pk 4485 (645P - Silverton Quad) - April 4, 2006


I was able to drive 2.4  miles  up  Rd  4030  (Mallardy  Ridge  Rd  off  the
Mountain Loop Hwy) until stopped by snow at the first switchback, elev  2000
ft. Of course this didn\'t mean that I could ski from this point on.   I  had
to half walk half ski for another 0.75 miles until I  hit  consistent  snow,  a
normal situation for spring conditions. I then skied the rest of  the  road,
taking a left on a better looking spur at a final junction, to  its  end  at
3400 ft below the NW ridge (4 miles, 2 hrs).  No open clearcuts  here,  just
regrown second growth.  Still, I was able to stay on skis for the  climb  to
the ridge until it narrowed and the trees thickened even more.  Then  I  was
forced to switch to snowshoes. I followed the ridge up  and  down  until  it
steepened at 3900 ft, where I then elected to traverse semi-open  slopes  on
the N side of Pt 4472 until I could regain the ridge past this point  via  a
steep gully. The snow  was  very  slushy  and  deep  and  trailbreaking  was
exhausting. I topped out at 3:30 (2850 ft, 4:45 hr). Most of the  ridge  and
summit was wooded but a hundred feet or so farther along the  crest  was  an
open area with  good  views  of  Big  Four.  I  originally  had  visions  of
including the two 4480+ prominence points farther along the  ridge  on  this
trip but I ran out of energy. With better snow and/or  help  breaking  trail
they probably would have been possible. Instead I turned  around  early  and
for once skied down a road in daylight.

Total: 10.5 miles, 3150 ft, 8 hrs.

Sleepover Butte (4880+ ft - 480P - Blowout Mtn Quad) - April 6, 2006


This will probably be my last time this year skiing from this Sno-Park  near
Easton. The snow is getting mighty thin  and  already  the  4X4  yahoos  are
starting to make tracks up the road. Still skiing was  reasonable  on  solid
snow until I came to a section of road melting  out  below  the  S  side  of
Cabin Mtn. Here I skied dirty  ribbons  of  snow  and  tiptoed  across  bare
ground so I wouldn\'t have to take off my skis. They were my "rock  skis"  so
I wasn\'t too concerned about ruining their bottoms.

I followed Rd 41 4.5 miles to the junction with Rd 4110  up  Log  Cr.  After
another mile I turned right on  spur  123  and  skied  a  long  4  miles  on
increasingly slushy snow to its end  on  the  ridge  at  4500  ft.  Here  an
unexpected narrow thickly wooded crest led  down  to  the  open  saddle  and
clearcut slopes below Sleepover. The snow was  sticky  enough  I  needed  no
skins for the final 400 ft climb to the summit (10 miles, 3000 ft, 5 hrs).

Seeking a different way back, I took a direct line down the narrow  nose  of
a SE spur ridge, which offered fun but challenging skiing,  until  I  hit  a
road and found my way back to Rd 4110 along Log  Cr.  Partially  wanting  to
avoid the melted out section of Rd 41, but more wanting to explore  inviting
clearcuts I had seen on the N slope of Cole Butte, I turned right uphill  on
a logging spur just before the intersection with Rd 41. Bad Idea! I  thought
I had plenty of time left  for  this  exploration  and  both  the  USGS  and
Greentrails maps showed this spur going all the way through to the  road  up
Cole Cr.  They were both wrong. I have learned not to completely trust  USGS
maps when it comes to old roads but if you can\'t trust a  currently  revised
Greentrails map who can you trust?

After climbing some 1200 ft  I  came  to  a  junction  where  my  supposedly
through spur went down hill, but the main obviously better spur  (which  the
maps showed deadending) went uphill. This was a clue.  I  followed  my  spur
downhill with increasing trepidation as  it  increasingly  deteriorated.  It
had to descend 1000 ft to get below a cliffy ridge and I was able to  follow
a road of sorts to this point but then it just ended and I was in a  bit  of
trouble. I was too far down (and far too tired) to  return  the  way  I  had
come.  I couldn\'t continue straight down to Rd 41 (only 400 ft below me)  as
I was on the wrong side of Cabin Cr and would never be able to cross  it.  I
was stranded on a gosh awful steep wooded, brushy hillside with  gosh  awful
patchy snow and darkness was not far away. I didn\'t have much choice but  to
continue contouring, hoping I would run into the road from the  other  side,
hoping there was a road from the other side. I will spare  you  the  details
of wrestling myself and my skis through this stuff. But eventually  I  spied
a log landing.  Where there is a log landing there is  a  logging  road.  It
was higher than the road indicated on the map but when I climbed  up  to  it
sure enough there was a road and it led all the way to the Cole  Cr  Rd  and
my way out.  Of course the last bit was in the dark,  again.  But  that  was
okay.  After all I do have a reputation to uphold.

Total: 22 miles, 4500 ft and 10:30 hrs.

Prairie Mtn (5678 ft - 1358P - Prairie Mtn Quad) - April 11, 2006


I had this crazy notion that Prairie Mtn could be climbed on skis.  I  guess
I was unreasonably influenced by all the logging roads that  are  marked  on
the maps on the W side. What I neglected to fully notice was that the  roads
are very old and not really connected and that  there  is  plenty  of  steep
unknown terrain to negotiate. But being the perennial optimist that I  am  I
sallied forth on this day with great expectations of  wonderful  skiing.  My
first inkling of trouble was when I came to a premature end of  the  Prairie
Mtn Rd at 2600 ft without encountering a bit of snow. The road  was  blocked
at this point and obviously decommissioned  and  abandoned  with  the  usual
ditches every hundred or feet or so. My vision of skiing up the road to  its
end came crashing to a halt. At this point the smart thing to do would  have
been to give up my dream of skiing and just accept that to  get  the  summit
snowshoes would be the obvious choice. Did I do this? Of course not!

I trudged up the road carrying my skis  (and  also  snowshoes  -  I  am  not
completely stupid). Eventually I ran into continuous snow  that  would  have
been skiable except that each ditch across the road was  bare  with  running
water.  After taking skis on and off half a dozen times I realized this  was
ridiculous and switched to snowshoes so I could walk across the  ditches.  I
then came to the end of the road at 3100 ft at a  spur  ridge.  Here  things
looked even bleaker. No nice clearcuts in sight just awful dense woods  with
patchy rotten snow. I had a  long  debating  conversation  with  myself  and
waffled as to what to do. I really should have cut my losses and  gone  home
to pet my kitties or at the very least recognized skis as a  very  bad  idea
and left them here.  Did I do either? Of course not!

I continued on up the ridge struggling with skis  getting  caught  on  every
branch and twig in sight and falling numerous times through terrible  rotten
snow into holes hip deep. This with  snowshoes  on.  Progress  was  slow  to
nonexistent and punctuated with loud cursing and much gnashing of  teeth.  I
think I continued on sheer faith that things would get  better,  remembering
the many times a trip has looked hopeless only to have it turn out,  if  not
exactly wonderful, at least successful  summit-wise.  Well  things  did  get
better.  After taking a full hour to gain a mere 500 feet  I  came  upon  an
upper road. This road too was abandoned but although it was a bit  overgrown
it was not ditched and I could ski it to its end higher on the  ridge  (elev
4000 ft). I now had a view of my objective and possible route.   All  memory
of my previous difficulties vanished as things began looking up.

From the end of the road I contoured on surprisingly  pleasant  terrain,  on
skis, around the head of Gravel Cr to a 1000 ft snow gully  leading  to  the
open slope below the cliffs of the long  Prairie  Mtn  ridge.  As  the  open
slope steepened I began to litter it with my discarded  gear.  First  to  go
were my skis, then my snowshoes and finally my ski pole when I  switched  to
an ice ax and kicked steps up hardening snow near the  very  end.  I  topped
out on the ridge at a 5500 ft notch just to the S of Pt 5586.  I  was  lucky
this was a place I could descend the other side about 100 ft to an easy  but
exhausting knee deep slushy traverse below the rocky and pinnacled ridge.  I
kept to the traverse until forced up to tiptoe on the crest  to  bypass  the
headwall of All Cr.  Once past this I dropped down again  to  contour  below
the final summit rocks and ascend up the E ridge.

A flagpole and melted out plaque in memory of Rick Green "from  the  Prairie
Boys" marked the summit (3700 ft, 6 hrs). I reveled in my surroundings,  all
the more sweet because of previous difficulties  and  uncertainty.  I  could
see Glacier and Baker and much of the  North  Cascades.  Closer  were  Three
Fingers and Whitehorse across the Sauk River.  But most impressive  was  the
N face of White Chuck just to the S. However the  views  were  beginning  to
fade.  I could see ominous weather moving my way  and  it  was  starting  to
precipitate.  It was time to go.

 The trip back to the notch was a wallow through ever  deeper  and  slushier
snow.  I faced in for the steep first bit down  from  the  notch,  then  ran
down to my skis retrieving discarded gear on  the  way.  The  ski  down  the
gully was mostly marginal in tip trapping deep slush  and  of  the  survival
style although I did get in a few turns. The traverse back to the  road  was
again pleasant and fast.  Traverses are  so  much  more  fun  on  skis  than
snowshoes. Skiing down the upper road I was struck by  the  fantastic  image
of dark storm clouds forming over Three Fingers  and  Whitehorse.  Beautiful
and foreboding both. I even heard some thunder.  The rest  of  the  way  out
was in light rain.  I took a different way down to the lower  road  avoiding
the dense trees by following an open creek drainage on foot where I  instead
fell through rotten snow into the water many times.  By now my feet were  so
wet it didn\'t matter. I also cut the  switchback  on  the  lower  road  thus
lessening the number of annoying ditches I had to cross. I  arrived  at  the
car (before dark I may add) a very happy climber.  Maybe the  skiing  wasn\'t
exactly superb but considering the way  the  day  started  I  was  certainly
satisfied with it.

Total: 8 miles, 4000 ft and 9:30 hrs.

Directions: From Darrington and Hyw 530 turn right just before the  RS  onto
Sauk Prairie Rd, then after several miles right  onto  Prairie  Mtn  Rd,  Rd
2140. This road is marked, but not well and looks like a driveway to  start.
 I missed it on my first pass. The road goes about 6 miles before ending  at
2600 ft at a big ditch

Scarface (6180 ft - 708P - Sunrise Quad) - April 13, 2006


My original plan was to drive up the West Fork White River Rd 74 as  far  as
possible to ski up some obscure peaks on the Clear West Quad, but  the  road
was still gated at the river crossing with no snow in sight. So  it  was  on
to my backup plan. Instead I drove up Rd 75, very near  the  gate,  about  1
mile until stopped by snow at 2700 ft.  The  usual  patchy  transition  zone
lasted to 3100 ft where continuous snow took over. I continued up Rd  75  to
Rd 7530 and finally the spur road that ended at Lonesome  Lake  (6.5  miles,
2100 ft, 3 hrs).

This whole area is very ski friendly with numerous logging roads,  clearcuts
and patches of open woods that provide  excellent  skiing  under  the  right
snow conditions. Today conditions were not  ideal  with  all  the  slush  of
recent days having frozen to hard crust. But it did make for easy uphill  as
I made my across Lonesome Lake and through pleasant terrain  to  a  clearcut
and the ridge above.  On the ridge I came across a road  not  shown  on  the
map, which I followed S around Pt 5880 to its end  at  another  clearcut  on
the boundary of Mt Rainier National  Park.  A  traverse  led  to  the  final
delightful N ridge of Scarface, easily skiable all the  way  to  the  summit
(8.5 miles, 3500 ft, 5 hrs). Here I was treated to a view of the  impressive
cliffs of the E ridge that overlook Lake Eleanor, though  I  could  not  see
the lake itself. It also looked as if the S ridge could be easily skied  for
a distance, perhaps all the way to Grand Park.

It was now snowing and enough fresh had fallen, a  good  inch,  that  skiing
down the ridge was very nice indeed. On the way back I continued  to  follow
the ridge road N to more clearcuts and a gentle descent to  the  main  road.
At about 4000 ft the snow turned to rain and the rest of the way out was  on
wet, slow snow. I was very pleased my unexpected "backup" plan  turned  into
a gem. There are many opportunities for continued exploration in  this  area
and it certainly warrants return visits.

Total: 17 miles, 3600 ft and 8 hrs.

After two  wonderful  ski  trips  in  a  row,  Scarface  last  Thursday  and
Elizabeth Ridge with Jim  and  Eileen  on  Sunday,  I  was  hoping  to  take
advantage of this last winter blast and powder snow and make  it  three.  Of
course you can never really recapture the magic of a  prior  trip,  but  you
can create a new and different magic.  Although I missed the wonderful  snow
by a day (or maybe just half a day or even hours), I did  get  my  magic  in
the form of good weather and views to die for. And  the  skiing  wasn\'t  all
bad. It just wasn\'t wonderful.

I was so taken by the skiing and terrain on  my  trip  up  Scarface  that  I
wanted to return to this area to explore  more  and  get  the  views  I  had
missed the first time. Then I noticed that there was a new peak above  Grand
Park that I had not climbed. So now I had a destination.

I began again up Rd 75 off the West Fork White River Rd 74. This time I  was
able to drive 1.7 miles, to 3200 ft, (.7 miles farther than  last  time)  up
the road although  it  required  putting  on  chains  to  negotiate  a  deep
snowpatch to accomplish that.  I am not sure I gained much time but it  sure
was nice not to have to walk the  mostly  bare  road  after  the  snowpatch,
especially on the way down when I was  really  tired.  I  tried  to  find  a
shortcut up Mule Cr on a spur road shown on  the  map,  but  this  road  was
ditched and overgrown.  I did cut a couple of the switchbacks  on  the  main
road but for the most part I followed my previous route to the  ridge  above
Lonesome Lk. Snow varied from frozen crust  to  powder  to  slush  depending
upon exposure.

I was forced to go over the summit of Scarface again, then descend  700  ft,
as cliffs prevented any contouring around it.  But I really didn\'t mind,  as
I wanted to ski the S ridge anyway, which had  looked  so  appealing  to  me
before. And it was very nice. Even the final descent off the ridge to the  W
in the trees was pleasant. Snow by  now  was  quite  slushy  in  the  rising
temperatures but still skiable.  I  then  contoured  through  more  pleasant
terrain to a tarn and up the E ridge to the summit of Grand  Park  Pk  (4000
ft, 6:15 hrs). Most of the  terrain  to  here  and  the  summit  itself  was
wooded, but just to the S was a spectacular viewpoint of Grand Park  and  Mt
Rainier. As I looked down on Grand Park, surely one of  my  favorite  places
in the whole of Rainier, I felt privileged to be one of the  few  people  to
ever have seen it at this time of year.

I enjoyed my magic as long as I could as  it  soon  turned  to  frustration.
Already (4:00) much of the snow was developing a pesky breakable  crust.  It
didn\'t even have to be in the shade (the sun was low  enough  it  no  longer
melted it). By the time I climbed back up  to  Scarface,  things  were  even
worse. There were still pockets of protected powder but I  was  never  quite
sure where they were.  And so the ski out was a challenge.  Even  the  upper
road had turned into breakable crust, even in  my  uphill  tracks,  and  was
very slow going. The lower road was still soft and wet, but by  the  time  I
got there it was dark. When I reached the car I  was  most  happy  for  that
extra .7 mile I didn\'t have to walk.

Natapoc Mtn (4204 ft - 2124P - Winton Quad) & Natapoc Ridge (3291 ft - 171P
- Plain Quad) - April 27, 2006

This should have been a very nice bike ride, but  not  this  early  and  not
this year.  There was still too much snow. However, this was the time I  had
free to do this trip and so I went  for  it  anyway,  hoping  I  could  push
through the odd snowpatch  to  bike  high  enough  to  get  within  striking
distance. No such luck. I began on bike at 2120 ft on the N end of  Rd  6601
near Plain. I originally chose this road rather then the more direct S  end,
because it was a gentler climb and  because  it  went  past  Natapoc  Ridge,
which I also wanted to climb. At 2600 ft I hit a snowpatch that had  stopped
all vehicle traffic but I was able to push through it.  At  2900  ft,  where
the road turns to the N side, I hit continuous snow and all hope  was  lost.
I was too far away to  force  the  summit  on  foot.  I  turned  around  and
followed a lower spur road until also stopped by snow, but here I was  close
enough to climb Natapoc Ridge on foot. At least I had something to show  for
my effort. RT: 8 miles, 1365 ft and 3 hrs.

Not yet giving up on the day, I now tried the S end of Rd 6601  with  a  new
plan in mind. Forget the bike and drive as close as possible to  the  summit
and climb directly on foot. I ran into impassible snow at  2500  ft,  turned
around and parked at a spur road at 2300 ft. From here  I  climbed  a  steep
wooded spur ridge, ran into an old road that contoured right around  a  hill
to a powerline, and  followed  the  powerline  road  until  past  a  ravine.
Pleasant open woods with patchy snow led the rest of the way to  the  mostly
bare N ridge at 4000 ft. The summit was marked with a cairn. There  were  no
views on the wooded summit. RT: 2.5 miles, 1900 ft and 2.5 hrs.

Tumwater Mtn (4480+ ft - 2320P - Leavenworth Quad) - April 28, 2006

For this peak I was forced to use the bike  to  start,  even  though  I  was
certain I wouldn\'t get too far, as the road, just  outside  Leavenworth,  is
gated at the beginning at 1400 ft. This is a steep road, most of  which  was
too steep for me to ride up. So I pushed. At  around  2400  ft  I  ran  into
several trees across the road that required huffing and puffing to  get  the
bike over, under and around. Just past the junction with  the  4WD  road  at
3000 ft I ran into snow. So I left my bike here and headed up the  E  ridge.
This would have been very pleasant travel except for the fact  that  it  had
been recently burned and the fallen dead  trees  and  debris  made  for  all
manner of obstacles.  Rather  like  hiking  through  slash  with  the  added
delight that everything you touch turns to black soot. The last 500 feet  or
so was solid snow and much easier going. Not knowing which bump on the  main
ridge was higher I climbed both, concluding the N one the true summit.

It may have been an effort to push the bike up the road, but the  ride  down
was sweet and made it all worthwhile. RT: 6.6 mile, 3200 ft and 4 hrs.

Tiptop2 (3276 ft - 636P) & Tiptop3 (3251 ft - 451P) - Tiptop Quad - May 16,
2006


This would have been a very pleasant trip except for the heat.  It was  HOT,
HOT, HOT.  The temperature in Cashmere later in the day was 98 degrees.  And
it didn\'t help that I had things to do at my cabin before starting home  and
ended up hiking in the heat of the day.

From Cashmere, I took the Mission Cr Road. I had no prior knowledge  of  how
to get  up  these  peaks,  counting  on  being  able  to  go  most  anywhere
crosscountry. My first choice was from the NE up  Sherman  Canyon  where  it
looked like I could make a nice loop taking in both tops, but, not being  as
bold as some people I know when it comes to trespassing, I couldn\'t see  any
easy way into the canyon through  private  property  or  past  driveways  to
homes. So I continued S to National Forest land driving  up  Sand  Cr  to  a
small parking spot near Poison Canyon.

An old road-turned-trail followed Poison Cr. This road  was  overgrown  with
brush and worse, nettles, and since I was in shorts my legs  ended  up  full
of scratches and welts. After 0.75 mile a distinct waytrail left the creek  and
climbed steeply up  a  spur  ridge  past  interesting  sandstone  slabs  and
pinnacles. At 2800 ft I began  a  traverse  N  through  gorgeous  fields  of
Arrowleaf Balsamroot below Tiptop2  to  the  saddle  with  Tiptop3.  I  then
followed the ridge, part of which was a delightful  rocky  hogback,  to  the
highpoint of Tiptop3 on the SE end.  Views  were  expansive  and  the  snowy
Enchantments enticing in sharp contrast to my sweltering environment.

I returned to the saddle to follow the ridge S to Tiptop2. A  very  distinct
(horse?) trail led up to this point from the E and presumably the homes  and
ranches along Mission Cr. But I  descending  to  the  S  and  picked  up  my
waytrail leading back to Poison Cr and more encounters with nettles.

I had hoped to climb another top nearby (Tiptop4, 2889 ft)  but  I  was  now
totally wilted and out of liquid refreshment, so I settled for  cooling  off
with a nice dinner at the Big Y CafÃ© and  returning  home  at  a  reasonable
hour.

Total: 4.5 miles, 2600 ft and 4:30 hrs.

Abernathy Peak (USGS Gilbert) - I was  able  to  follow  the  Scatter  Creek
trail (off the Twisp River road) to about 6000 ft,  then  headed  uphill  in
opening terrain on firm snow to make camp at lovely Scatter Lake at 5:00  PM
(4 hrs and 4000 ft). I spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing in the  sun,
but as soon as it set behind the ridge  the  temperature  plummeted,  and  I
retreated to the warmth of my sleeping bag.

My thermometer registered 22 degrees in my  tent  the  next  morning,  lower
than expected this time of year. That made getting ready to climb my peak  a
chilly ordeal, but I still managed to start at 6:30 AM. The cold night  made
the frozen corn snow ideal for cramponing and I made rapid progress  upward.
I soon emerged into most welcome sunshine.  A minor  error  put  me  on  the
south ridge below a small rocky bump that I passed to the left. It was  then
an easy matter to follow the ridge the rest of the way to the  summit  (1:10
hrs and 1300 ft).

Views of the Chelan-Sawtooth Wilderness to the south  and  Gilbert  just  to
the west across North Creek were crystal clear but the  Gardner  massive  to
the north was obscured by wispy fog. I spent a  good  half  hour  excavating
the summit cairn from hard snow looking for a register. I  didn\'t  find  one
but maybe I didn\'t dig deep enough.  Anyway, I left a new one just in case.

I was back in camp in a little over half an  hour,  this  time  exiting  the
ridge before the rocky bump. My tent was thankfully  now  in  full  sunshine
and I lounged around for a couple of hours before heading out at  11:00  and
reaching the trailhead at 1:00.  This was my first real  mountain  since  my
husband died on April 14 (and several months before).  It felt great  to  be
back in the mountains but was I ever sore afterward! 10 miles and  5300  ft.

Dark Peak - 8504 ft - 264P - Agnes Mtn Quad - May 28-31, 2006


A long planned trip to Dome/Sinister was thwarted this Memorial Day  weekend
by bad weather, as I am  sure  were  many  other  climber\'s  trips.  Of  the
original party members, only Annette and I were free and flexible enough  to
postpone departure by a day and change the destination  to  when  and  where
the weather would be better. Dark Peak seemed a natural choice for  us.   It
was on both our must do lists (Annette had tried it 3 years earlier and  was
itching to even the score. It was her first 100 Highest  peak)  and  it  was
not so committing that we wouldn\'t feel comfortable with  just  the  two  of
us.

Day 1: So it was a last minute scramble  to  figure  out  the  logistics  of
approaching the peak. This early in the season there are only  two  shuttles
a day from Stehekin to High Bridge, at 8am and 3pm, neither  geared  to  the
hiker or climber. This weird and inconvenient schedule meant  we  needed  at
least 4 days for the climb. We caught  the  9:45  sailing  of  the  Lady  II
(there was no advantage to taking the  earlier  Lady  Express)  to  Stehekin
where we then had to wait  around  until  3:00  for  the  shuttle.  At  High
Bridge, elev 1600 ft, we met Martin and  Wendy  coming  out  after  climbing
McGregor Mtn. What a small world the world  of  climbing  is  sometimes.  We
finally started hiking the Agnes Cr Trail (PCT) at 4:15 an easy but  up  and
down 5.5 miles to pleasant Fivemile Camp, elev 2200 ft (1200 ft,  2:20  hr).
This is in the Glacier Pk Wilderness and requires no permit to camp.  Up  to
now we had had no rain but there were threatening clouds lurking  about  and
they did produce some showers during the night while we  were  snug  in  our
tent.

Day 2: The next morning was mostly sunny and we were on our way at 8:30.  We
stashed some food and unneeded items before taking off, as we  had  to  camp
here again on night 3 in order to make it to High Bridge in  time  to  catch
the 9am shuttle. We soon began running into patchy snow on  the  trail  that
clearly showed the recent very large paw prints of a very large  bear  (yes,
our stashed food was hung high in  a  tree).  This  had  us  looking  around
nervously and making extra noise but we never encountered  Mr.  Bear.  After
about a mile, the trail came very close to an impressive gorge along  the  S
Fork Agnes Cr. From this point on the trail was completely snow-covered  and
we wandered around a bit but eventually came right out at  the  bridge  over
Swamp Cr, elev 2800 (3.1 miles, 660 ft, 2 hrs).

From the  bridge  we  headed  up  the  open,  forested,  and,  surprisingly,
snowfree ridge to the right of Swamp Cr.  Soon we ran into a segment of  the
old unmaintained trail and followed this into the  creek  valley  until  all
was again lost under snow.  The  heavy  snow  cover  was  most  helpful  and
covered most of the brush which I was expecting  as  described  by  numerous
tales of horror from previous parties. We pulled into the  basin  below  the
gorgeous roaring waterfall, elev 4350 ft, at 2:00 (6.7 miles, 2250 ft,  5:20
hrs from Fivemile). We had plenty of time to lounge  around,  eat,  nap  and
eat again, but once the sun left the basin it quickly became chilly  and  we
were happy to turn in early at 7:00.  Tomorrow would be a big day.   We  had
to climb the peak, break camp and get back to  Fivemile  or  chance  missing
the shuttle and taking another whole day (or hiking the additional 12  miles
to Stehekin).

Day 3: Summit Day dawned cold and clear with crampons required  right  away.
We started at 5:30 to the left of the waterfall following the  base  of  the
cliff up a steep broad gully almost to its end where a break led back  right
into the trees to the upper basin, elev 5000 ft.  A  complete  view  of  the
route was now before us and it looked  very  good  indeed.  We  crossed  the
basin to the base of the main gully below the Dark Glacier  where  we  roped
up. We worked our way up the right side of the gully  trying  to  avoid  the
jumble of recent avalanche debris filling most of it and  unto  a  rib  that
offered a direct way up a short steep step to a flatter area  above  beneath
a small rock wall.  Up to now the snow had been  either  perfect  cramponing
hard frozen snow or breakable crust, with both offering good  footing.  Then
unexpectedly in the middle of the step I ran into about  10  feet  of  water
ice hidden under several inches of unconsolidated new snow. This  pitch  got
my adrenaline flowing as I chopped both hand and footholds until  I  reached
easier snow again.

Above the ice pitch, a long easy traverse led across several  new  avalanche
tracks (we were thankful several days of sunny weather  had  stabilized  the
snow) to the base of the upper icefall  which  looked  as  if  it  could  be
bypassed either on the left or the right.  We elected for the left,  hugging
the bottom of a rock cliff as it was in the  shade  and  we  felt  the  snow
would be firmer.  Already the snow was beginning to soften in  the  sun  and
in places we were starting to break through the  crust.  We  then  traversed
the bowl above the icefall to the 8200 ft saddle on the  W  ridge.  A  short
steep tiptop along the edge of a moat abyss and we were on  the  broad  open
slopes leading to the final rocky S ridge and the summit (4300 ft, 6 hrs).

I was very puzzled by the wicked  ridge  leading  S  to  an  obviously  much
higher peak until it dawned on me that it was Bonanza.  What  an  impressive
peak that is from this vantage point. I knew we had to  be  on  the  summit,
still I was very happy when we found the register confirming this to be  the
case (Remember Dark does not have much prominence and  although  it  appears
very peak-like and worthy from the N,  once  on  the  summit  it  is  rather
dwarfed by Bonanza and not much more than a bump on the ridge.) But I  doubt
I was happier than Annette who I believe was ecstatic to  finally  make  the
summit.

I think I recognized every single name in the register, not that there  were
that many. I do believe only those pursuing  the  Bulger  100  Highest  List
climb Dark Pk. The register was placed on 9/3/95 by  Chris  Weber  and  Dave
Creeden followed by  Peggy  Goldman  and  Jim  Quade  6/27/98;  the  Bailles
6/18/99; Mike Torok and Dale Flynn 6/18/00;  Don  Beavon  7/27/01  (he  also
climbed Agnes, The  Needle  and  Heather  Ridge  on  the  same  trip);  Paul
Michelson, Martin Shetter and  Stu  Frinke  6/1/03;  Paul  Klenke  and  Mark
Iffrig (climbing from Fivemile in  one  day)  5/26/05;  and  last  the  ever
persistent Roy McMurtrey 7/18/05 after 5 tries in the same year.

The views from the top were stunning, with too many mountains  to  identify.
I picked out the most obvious and left it at that.  We could not tarry  long
on top as we still had miles to go before we slept.  Once  below  the  upper
icefall we removed crampons for the rest of  the  way  down  as  they  began
balling up badly. We avoided the ice pitch by taking a longer route  to  the
W down through waist high avalanche deposits and then back E to  our  uphill
tracks. We were in camp by 3:30, had a hot drink, ate, packed  up  and  were
ready to go again in an hour. We had a little trouble  finding  the  segment
of trail leading out of the Swamp Cr valley and  more  trouble  finding  the
main trail by the gorge and we were very tired and  running  out  of  steam,
but we did make it to Fivemile before dark, barely,  at  9:00  (11.7  miles,
4400 ft, 15:30 hrs total for the day). We had a hot meal before  turning  in
at 10:30.

Day 4: We rolled out of bed at 5:10 and left at 5:40  without  breakfast  to
assure plenty of time to make the shuttle.  We needn\'t have  worried  as  we
arrived at High Bridge a little after 8:00. The shuttle showed at 8:45  with
only two people aboard and the driver.  These were the first people  we  had
seen since leaving 3 days earlier. With nothing left now but time until  the
2:00 boat, we enjoyed the company of the couple  (from  Tennessee)  and  the
personable driver, an older gentleman in his 4th year driving the  bus,  who
gave a running commentary  of  the  history  of  the  Stehekin  Valley.   We
stopped at Rainbow Falls, the old one room schoolhouse and  the  bakery.  We
filled our tummies at the  restaurant  after  a  wonderful  hot,  and  free,
shower (clean clothes were stashed at the  ranger  station).  We  still  had
time to kill.  We missed the sailing of  the  earlier  Lady  Express,  which
would start daily runs on June 1, by one day. No,  the  schedule  makers  do
not make it easy to climb peaks in this area this time of year in  a  timely
manner.

Total: 28.4 miles and 8400 ft in 4 days.

Klawatti Pk (8485 ft) & Austera Pk (8334 ft) - Forbidden Pk Quad - June 20-
22, 2006

After an absence of over a year, I was thrilled to  once  again  climb  with
Linda. We make a very compatible team.  She  too  was  excited  to  get  out
again, although I think this trip was perhaps a bit  more  than  would  have
been ideal for her first outing in a long time. But she knows  me  well  and
really didn\'t expect anything less.

Day 1: In any event we started up the  climber\'s  trail  to  Eldorado  (elev
2200 ft) at 10:00   (after  stopping  for  the  appropriate  permit  at  the
Marblemount RS). Right off the bat the multiple log crossing of the  Cascade
River got the adrenaline flowing as we wrestled with balancing  packs  heavy
with climbing gear.  The trail  on  the  other  side  then  wasted  no  time
climbing steeply up through woods 1500 ft to a  series  of  tedious  boulder
fields.  We began running into patches of snow at the top of  the  last  one
and by the time we broke out into the open basin above, snow was  continuous
and deep. The high peaks and ridges were all in fog despite  a  forecast  of
zero percent chance of rain. We followed tracks to  the  ridge  crossing  at
6200 ft and down the other side on melting  out  slabs  (tricky  with  heavy
packs) onto the snow below the Eldorado Glacier.  Here we met a party  of  3
coming down from Eldorado after climbing it in a day and then  we  were  all
alone. A long seemingly endless plod up moderate slopes with  packs  getting
heavier and us getting more tired brought us to the usual  camping  spot  on
the E ridge of Eldorado at 5:30, elev 7600 ft (5 miles, 5600 ft,  7:30  hr).
We found a nice mostly bare tent site but no running water. A  cold  blowing
fog kept everything frozen solid. We would have to melt snow for water.

Day 2: It froze even more overnight and we began at 7:20 with  crampons  on.
We were right at fog level, with it drifting in and out. Below was  a  solid
layer of marine air.  We had had a good look at Klawatti  the  previous  day
before reaching camp and it had looked frightfully  steep  to  me  with  the
moat beginning to appear part way up the snowfinger. But I knew better  than
to  freak  out  at  a  distance  view  where   perspective   is   frequently
foreshortened. Today we had enough of a view  to  plot  our  long  (2  mile)
traverse across the Inspiration Glacier  to  Klawatti  Col.  It  was  really
quite straight forward with only a few crevasses in appearance, but I  think
we were both feeling a little nervous as a lone 2-person rope team  on  such
a large glacier.  But  the  cramponing  was  excellent  and  we  arrived  at
Klawatti Col in an hour.

After a rest and stashing extra gear and water at the col, we  traversed  to
the base of the snowfinger. It didn\'t look as bad as it had from a  distance
and the moat appeared to be crossable on the right side. I  led  off  across
the moat after placing our one and only picket, using two ice axes.  It  was
quite steep but the snow was excellent and I was  able  to  kick  reassuring
deep steps. At the full length of our 50m rope I reached a rock  band  above
and was able to get in  a  piece  of  protection.  Climbing  simultaneously,
Linda reached the rock band before I was able to get to  the  next  one  and
place another piece of protection. Another picket would have been nice.  But
the snow was good and neither of us  felt  uncomfortable,  so  we  continued
climbing simultaneously. Still, I felt better when I finally  got  something
in after another half rope length. A further  short  traverse  left  and  we
were on the bare rock of the S ridge where  an  easy  scramble  led  to  the
summit at 10:50 (1050 ft, 3:30 hr). There was no register  so  I  left  one.
From the top we did have a fairly good view of Austera and it looked  to  be
easy going to the summit rocks, just smooth crevasse less snow slopes.

We put crampons back on to go down and used the same protection as  the  way
up for running belays, but basically we just downclimbed facing in.  At  the
rock band above the moat, I set up a belay and brought Linda down, then  she
belayed me over the moat (our rope was too short to set up  a  rappel).  The
moat was  already  softening  in  the  intermittent  sun  and  our  previous
crossing was no longer trustworthy. I probed and stamped finding  what  firm
footing there was before taking a big step/jump across, and then  I  belayed
Linda across from the picket. I doubt this moat will be  crossable  on  snow
anymore this year.

Back at the col, it was now  completely  fogged  in.  We  removed  crampons,
picked up our stashed geared and crossed the col to the  McAllister  Glacier
to traverse below the W face of Klawatti to the small notch on the  N  ridge
leading to the Klawatti Glacier.  At the  notch  we  were  confronted  by  a
steep wind sculpted snow cliff on one side and a short 10 ft rock  cliff  on
the other.  The  rock  cliff  was  still  downclimbable,  but  we  used  the
assistance of a small 25 ft rope I had brought along just for this  purpose.
Once across the notch we were in sunshine again for the  rest  of  the  easy
way to the base of Austera. Crossing the ridge leading to the false  summit,
we got our first look at the true summit and the chockstone  chimney.   Once
again from a distance it looked frightful,  but  after  dropping  down  ugly
loose rock (which really was frightful)  to  the  base  of  the  chimney  it
didn\'t look too bad. There was a bit of snow and ice in the chimney,  but  I
was able to sling the chockstone itself for  protection  and  bodily  pulled
myself over the top. It was basically one  move.  Above  the  chockstone,  a
crawl along a moat and easy solid rock led to the summit at 4:00  (1800  ft,
8:40 hr). Again there was no register but I had already used the only one  I
brought.

We downclimbed to  the  chockstone  and  then  rappelled  over  it.  We  had
reasonable visibility the rest of the way back, arriving at Klawatti col  at
6:20 and camp at 7:50 (9 miles, 2250 ft, 12:30 hrs). But  camp  was  in  the
shade and cold and still no running water  was  available.  We  melted  more
snow and ate and drank as long as we could until forced into the comfort  of
our warm sleeping bags.

Day 3: We awoke late (7:00) the next morning to sunshine on our tent  and  a
bluebird day, or so we thought. We were able to lounge in the sun for a  few
hours but a thick layer of marine air below  gradually  rose  until  by  the
time we left at 10:00 we were in the fog again. It stayed foggy  and  cloudy
all the way down to the car (5 miles, 200 ft, 4:30 hrs.)

Total: 19 miles and 8050 ft in 3 days.

Tupshin Pk (8320+ ft - Stehekin Quad) & Devore Pk (8360+ ft - Mt Lyall
Quad) - June 25-28, 2006

Day 1: Bird Cr Camp. One of the major  disadvantages  of  climbing  solo  is
that you have to carry everything yourself. This was made  very  evident  to
me as I struggled up the Devore Cr Trail weighed down with  some  12  pounds
of technical gear. Fortunately, the weather was sunny and hot,  so  I  could
pare down the weight of personal gear to the bare minimum  clothing,  my  1-
pound sleeping bag and a bivy tent. Still my  pack  weight  was  pushing  40
pounds, heavy for me. Also unfortunately, the weather  was  sunny  and  hot.
Very hot.  By the time I  took  the  9:20  Field\'s  Point  Lady  Express  to
Stehekin and the 11:15 slow shuttle (Surprisingly, the driver remembered  me
from Dark Pk a month earlier, but then I  guess  there  are  not  that  many
little old gray-haired lady climbers about.) to Harlequin Bridge, elev  1200
ft, I found myself starting in the heat of the day. Then I  wandered  around
on unmarked roads searching for the start of the Stehekin R Trail,  which  I
finally found by heading for the airfield and skirting  around  it  until  I
came to the main trail on the other side. Four flat miles  later  I  finally
started up Devore Cr. I had tried to take a float plane directly  to  Weaver
Pt, but the flooding of the Stehekin R in May of  this  year  had  destroyed
the dock there so I was out of luck. It was now 2:30.

I vastly under estimated  the  time  it  would  take  to  get  to  Bird  Cr,
supposedly only 4 miles. With my heavy  pack  and  the  enervating  heat,  I
plodded slowly upward. At least the first section of trail was pretty as  it
switchbacked through open grassy glades and  alongside  a  deep  gorge.  But
higher up where it entered the valley it was so overgrown I had to  feel  my
way with my feet, which slowed me down even more. I began  to  despair  that
my idea of soloing these two peaks was  not  such  a  good  one.  I  finally
pulled into the most welcome sight of Bird Cr Camp, elev 4200  ft,  at  6:30
(8 miles, 3200 ft, 6 hrs).

Day 2: Tupshin Pk. I was following the excellent directions by  Paul  Klenke
on summitpost.org for both peaks. Good thing I had those as the ones in  the
Becky, Goldman and Stephenson books were all misleading, vague or  downright
wrong.  Beginning from camp at 6:30,  I  headed  up  and  rightward  through
pleasant mostly brushfree woods until I came to a  major  stream  gully.   I
then essentially followed the rib to the left of this creek  on  easy  semi-
open terrain to 6800 ft until I could drop  slightly  into  the  snow  basin
below Tupshin. I followed the snow to high below the E face where  the  rock
climbing began at 7600 ft (3500 ft, 4:30 hrs) on a rightward leading ramp.

I tried to follow Paul\'s direction, but somehow got off  track.  No  matter,
the climbing was easy and well within my comfort level. I scrambled  up  the
ramp and probably followed it too far. I saw no rappel anchors so just  kept
scrambling. From the end of the ramp I worked my way back  left  toward  the
center of the face where I reached my level of confidence and  roped  up.  I
think this was somewhere in the middle of Paul\'s pitch 3 as above it I  came
to the pitch 4 anchor (it was reassuring that I was now  on  route)  at  the
base of his chimney/right facing corner. I didn\'t  like  the  looks  of  the
corner and went up the broken face maybe 10-20 to the right where I  thought
I could get in better protection. I went up the wall and  then  left  almost
the full length of my 50 m rope to the last (pitch 5) rappel anchor. I  left
my rope here and scrambled the rest of the way to the summit at  1:15  (4150
ft, 6:45 hr) Being able to scramble so much saved me  immeasurable  time.  I
had originally thought I would have to rope solo 5 pitches,  which  meant  I
would have 10 pitches to climb  (each  pitch  climbed  twice).  I  ended  up
belaying only 2 pitches, and I only had to climb  the  first  one  twice.  I
found the rock on Tupshin excellent with plenty of  good  holds  and  places
for pro. I enjoyed the climbing greatly.

The original register was on top but it was mostly illegible.  A few  pieces
of new paper had been added on which were the names Mitch  Blanton  6/05/99,
Paul Klenke and Mark  Iffrig  6/29/05,  Roy  McMurtrey  8/15/05,  and  Scott
Stephenson and Bongi 6/6/06.

I downclimbed to the last rappel anchor (#5), then downclimbed on belay  (my
rope was still attached at the bottom and out the full length so I  couldn\'t
use it for a rappel to begin) until I had enough free rope  I  could  rappel
to anchor #4. Somehow I once again  missed  anchor  #3  so  set  up  my  own
rappel. I found anchor #2 on a horn to the right, which got me to  the  ramp
where I now found anchor #1 on a bush. I rappelled down the ramp and set  up
another rappel to reach the snow and my ice ax.  The  rappels  had  taken  2
hours. I was back in camp with no further problems by 6:00 (4200  ft,  11:30
hr).

Day 3: Devore Pk.  If Tupshin had gone  better  than  expected,  Devore  was
worse, although it started out well enough. Again  I  began  at  6:30,  this
time going straight uphill just to the  right  of  Bird  Cr.  I  essentially
stayed in the woods most of the way just above the brush line in  the  creek
bottom and travel was really quite good. I never came to the  rock  wall  at
4900 ft mentioned by Paul however I did cross a short patch of brush with  a
side creek below a wall, which he did not mention.   Perhaps  he  was  above
this. The only other real brush was  just  above  the  lower  basin,  but  I
followed Paul\'s directions by going high  and  it  too  was  very  short.  I
emerged into the gorgeous open  5800  ft  upper  basin  with  its  beautiful
waterfalls at 9:00 (1600 ft, 2:30 hr).

I found a convenient log to cross the much smaller yet still  roaring  creek
and started up the obvious snow gully on the other side to exit  the  basin.
The snow was in the shade and although not hard enough to make me  wish  for
crampons it was hard enough for me to take care. At the head  of  the  gully
at 6400 ft I crossed a bowl and climbed to its head at 7000  ft.  The  upper
part was somewhat hazardous with rotten snow between rock outcrops  undercut
by running water.  Above I was in the lake basin and thought the rest  would
be clear sailing, but as I looked at  the  saddle  of  the  E  ridge  I  was
dismayed to see most its length guarded by impassible cornices. I  saw  only
two possible ways up, one to the left up two disconnected  outcroppings  and
one to the right threading between the cornice and a  short  rock  wall.   I
headed to the right one first as it was more direct, but  as  I  approached,
the snow looked frightfully steep and I couldn\'t really tell if there was  a
passage around the corner through the rock. So I headed left. This  was  not
pleasant either as I scrambled up wet slippery loose rock and  rotten  snow.
I made it to the ridge but I decidedly did not want to go down that way.

Once on the ridge I easily followed along its crest, then on the  left  side
on loose scree to below the rock towers Paul calls  "the  Bottles".  I  must
admit they did look like bottles. I passed the bottles on the right on  snow
and crossed a notch to the S side. A  rising  traverse  scrambling  class  3
rock trying to avoid remnant rotten snow patches led to  another  notch  and
the  SW  side  of  Devore.  I  could  now  see  the  false  summit  and  the
"unavoidable 20 foot class 4 step". Darn! It looked higher than 20  ft.   It
also looked harder than class 4. Getting closer  didn\'t  make  it  look  any
easier. It was frankly more than I expected and felt harder than anything  I
had done on Tupshin, but maybe that was just because I wasn\'t  prepared  for
it or was getting tired. But at least I  found  several  cracks  to  provide
protection, which justified me bringing a small rack (I pared it  down  from
what I took on Tupshin). I tied off my rope at the rappel anchor  above  and
continued ropeless as I didn\'t want to have to climb that thing twice.  That
was a mistake. As I rounded the corner of the exposed but easy ledge  around
the false summit I saw the supposedly class 3 summit gully.  It sure  looked
harder to me. At that point I should have gone back  for  the  rope,  but  I
didn\'t. The gully wasn\'t as hard as it looked but  it  did  have  two  short
what I would consider class 4 steps in it and I  knew  they  would  give  me
trouble going down.

I reached the summit at 2:15 (4200 ft, 7:45 hrs). The original register  was
also on this peak but it was legible.  It was placed 7/28/1940 by the  first
ascent party. I also noted Paul Michelson and Martin Shetter  9/2/95,  Peggy
Goldman, Mike Torok and Dale Flynn 6/15/96  and  the  same  people  who  had
signed in on Tupshin.

As expected, descending the summit  gully  gave  me  trouble  and  I  dinked
around looking for an easier way (there wasn\'t one)  and  using  the  slings
and pro I had with me to set up a short belay.   But  there  were  no  solid
anchors and in the end I just downclimbed carefully after wasting a  lot  of
time. I then rappelled the 4th class step. I  reversed  everything  back  to
the E ridge saddle where I decided to rappel  down  the  rock  wall  of  the
right option of the way up. I found a solid horn for an  anchor  and  I  was
happy to have lugged my 50m rope along as it got me down the  wall  and  the
steepest part of the snow to more gentle slopes  below.  Fast  plungstepping
and glissading worked until the rim of the bowl where more care  was  needed
to get down. The final snow gully was in the shade once  again  (or  perhaps
still) so care was needed here also. I was very happy to reach the  relative
safety of the upper basin at 4:45. Two hours later I was back in camp  (4200
ft, 12:15 hrs).

Day 4: Successful Retreat.  I got up relatively early so I  could  leave  by
7:00 to catch the 12:30 shuttle. The trail did seem shorter on the way  down
but still longer than 4 miles and it took me 2:40 hr  of  steady  hiking  to
reach the  river  trail.  Interestingly,  parts  of  the  river  trail  were
slightly under water now as the river continued to rise  and  flood  in  the
very warm weather, but it was no great problem. I reached  Harlequin  Bridge
at 11:30 (8 miles, 300 ft, 4 hrs) with plenty of time  to  wash  up  in  the
river before the shuttle came. It was the same friendly  driver  and  I  was
the only one on the bus. We stopped at the bakery  where  I  ordered  a  ham
sandwich which I devoured in  record  time.  I  caught  the  2:00  Lady  II,
sleeping most of the  way  back  and  dreaming  of  wonderful  (and  not  so
wonderful) rock climbing.  I stopped for  delicious  actually  tree  ripened
fruit at a stand in Entiat and had another meal at the  Big  Y  CafÃ©  before
making the final drive home.

Total: 24 miles and 11900 ft in 4 days.

Hozomeen Mtn, S Pk (8003 ft - 1483P - Skagit Pk Quad) - July1-3, 2006


I really had no idea what I was getting into  when  I  first  accepted  Mike
Torok\'s invitation to climb both Hozomeen Pks. I had vaguely  heard  of  the
higher N Hozomeen and I knew it was not trivial but I had done  no  research
and had very little detail. Of the S Pk I knew next to nothing.  Then  as  I
began to look at the map and route descriptions  and  actual  (intimidating)
pictures of the mountain, it slowly dawned  on  me  that  this  would  be  a
challenging ascent, particularly of the harder S Pk.

Day 1: Rounding out the party were  Jim  Brisbine,  Dave  Creeden  and  Beth
Blattenberger. We drove  in  two  separate  cars,  through  Canada,  to  the
Hozomeen Lake TH (back in the USA) elev 1700 ft  and  began  at  11:15.  The
trail was in good shape, except for one very large blowdown, and we  covered
the 3.6 miles to the 2800 ft lake in 1:40 hrs despite the  oppressive  heat.
We had a good view of the mountain from the lake  and  could  pick  out  the
gully we were aiming for that led to the col  between  the  SW  and  S  Pks,
planning on climbing the S Pk first. It took a good 1:30 hrs to  get  around
the lake on the E side through moderate brush and reach a dry boulder  gully
to the N. Not recognizing  this  as  the  gully  we  wanted  to  follow  (we
expected water to be in it)  we  continued  traversing  N  and  up.  Finally
realizing our mistake we headed back S again,  still  on  an  upward  trend,
through more difficult brush. By the time we came back to the gully  it  was
too cliffy to enter so we continued up  very  steep  hillside  along  its  N
edge. By now the heat was taking its toll, we were all dragging and we  were
running out of water.

Somewhere around 7:00 and 4800 ft things became critical.  We were  all  out
of water, we hadn\'t been able to get into the gully  and  the  hillside  was
too steep to set up a camp. Our first priority was water, so we dropped  our
packs while the guys searched for a way to  get  into  the  gully,  carrying
everyone\'s water bottles. Beth and I stayed behind so they  could  find  the
packs again and while waiting I looked around for any feasible bivy spot.  A
short ways uphill I found a cluster of boulders in the woods that offered  a
few minimal semi-flat spots.  It wasn\'t great but it was better  than  where
we had dropped the packs. Meanwhile the guys had found a way down  into  the
main gully where a dry gully entered from the left,  and  40  minutes  later
returned with enough of the life saving liquid to get us through the  night.
We set up camp, elev 4950 ft (3300ft, 8:30 hr), such as it was, had  a  cold
dinner not even bothering to heat water, and turned in at 9:30.  It  was  so
warm we slept much of the night on top of our  sleeping  bags  (but  in  the
bivy sacks for protection from the bugs).

Day 2: We started the next morning at 5:45, with daypacks, by following  the
guy\'s previous route into  the  gully,  where  we  refilled  all  the  water
bottles. It was now possible to follow the gully up.  We  emerged  from  the
bouldery gully at 7:30, elev 5800 ft, into an open basin and worked our  way
up rubblely slabs toward the SW Col. We were all surprised with  how  little
snow there was. Near the top the terrain steepened. A  broad  ledge  led  to
the wide col, but for some reason we were tricked to head for a more  direct
notch to the left of a 7300 ft knob on the ridge line. This was not  a  good
idea but by the time we realized it we were too far above the ledge to  want
to descend. So we ended up  climbing  class  3-4  rotten  rock  up  the  rib
leading to the top of the knob. Somewhere in here Jim was  almost  clobbered
by a huge rock.

Once on top of the knob, at 10:00, we finally had our first view  of  the  S
Pk. What we saw was not encouraging. It looked horrific to  me  and  no  one
could see an obvious or even reasonable  route.   In  a  moment  of  supreme
hopeful optimism Mike drolly stated, "Well,  it  must  lay  back!"   We  all
burst out laughing. From the knob we descended the  short  distance  to  the
notch and then down into  a  gully  several  hundred  feet  until  we  could
traverse to up and over the next rib. Here we ran into the first snow.  More
rock and snow traverses on the other side put us below the  S  face  of  the
peak and incredibly loose rotten awful cruddy class 3-4 ledges, gullies  and
ramps. It was very unpleasant stuff and rockfall  was  a  constant  problem.
After a couple hundred feet of  this,  generally  working  our  way  to  the
right, the terrain steepened to class 4+ low class 5 unprotectable rock  and
we began to question the wisdom of proceeding on this line. I  for  one  had
reached my level of comfort and I think several others  were  also  at  that
point or fast approaching it.

This was the low point of the climb. We were in very dangerous  terrain  and
saw no obvious way out of it.  Prospects were bleak indeed. I would have  to
say Dave saved the day.  Unwilling to give up,  he  traversed  back  to  the
left and found a hidden gully/ledge system that, although  still  loose  and
unpleasant, was much better than the way we had  been  going.  Part  of  the
problem was that we had no good route description to help out.  Beckey\'s  is
very confusing.  The key is that you have to go  to  the  notch  in  the  SW
Ridge. Once we made it to  the  notch  we  essentially  followed  the  ridge
crest, which does indeed "lay back", at least enough  so  it  is  climbable.
Jim lead one pitch up a groove that did have a  few  cracks  for  protection
and fixed a line for us to follow on prussik. We used another fixed line  on
one other short exposed section, but for the  most  part  we  scrambled  the
mostly class 4 rock unroped. There simply  was  not  enough  time  to  belay
everything and the lack of good protection  and  the  loose  rock  where  it
would be more of a liability than a help precluded the use of a rope.

And then we came to the 12 ft 5.6 step. 12 ft can seem awfully high when  it
is steep and difficult and unprotectable (we could  find  no  place  to  put
pro). We all stood at the base waffling and hoping someone else  would  take
the lead. Again Dave saved the day, and after a false start, swarmed  up  it
in one magnificent push. The rest of  us  followed  on  belay.  I  found  it
difficult but did manage to climb it without help from the rope  other  than
psychological. And that was it. The rest was an easy scramble to  the  broad
summit. Though, least you get too overconfident at this point, I was  almost
done in by rockfall in the final gully  when  several  rocks  cascaded  down
upon me. Most harmlessly hit my helmet but one small one did get me  in  the
shoulder, fortunately with no great harm. It was partially my own fault  for
following too closely below the person above me  in  my  zeal  to  make  the
summit.

We summited at 3:00 (3900 ft, 9:15 hr) where we found  a  register  in  very
good shape inside a glass jar. There were only two  entries;  one  for  1990
and one for 1993. Holy Smokes! No one else had  climbed  this  peak  for  13
years! I had no idea it was climbed  so  infrequently.  We  were  even  more
elated at our success. But our climb wasn\'t over yet.  We still had  to  get
down, no trivial thing.

We rappelled the step and the groove,  downclimbing  all  the  rest  to  the
notch. Then we set up two double rope rappels down the  cruddy  ledges  that
got us all the way to the snow and the traverse and climb  back  up  to  the
knob notch and the knob. From the knob we descended all the way to  the  col
where we picked up the easy ledge (we really should have come up this  way).
Then it was just a seemingly endless descent down the slabs  and  the  gully
on loose rock where you had to stay ever vigilant to avoid disaster. At  our
entry into the gully, we washed up, soaked our aching feet, cooled  off  and
replenished our water.  We got all hot and sweaty again on the final 200  ft
up to our bivy, which at this point was looking pretty good to  us  (my  how
standards can go down when you are desperate). We all dragged into camp  one
at a time somewhere around 9:45 (4400 ft, 16 hr) just before dark.   We  did
take the time to heat water for a hot meal, finally going  to  bed  sometime
after 11:00.

Day 3: There was some discussion,  but  not  a  whole  lot.  It  was  almost
understood we were all too fried and beat to give the N Pk  a  try.  All  we
wanted was to get down to Ross Lake for a refreshing dip. From our  bivy  we
headed straight W downhill, somehow missing much of the  brush  of  the  way
up, until we crossed Hozomeen Cr. We then contoured as well as  possible  to
hit the trail maybe a mile  or  so  from  the  TH.  We  did  run  into  some
unpleasantness in the creek bottom, but it was much better than  going  back
around the lake. We were somewhat guided  to  the  trail  by  the  sound  of
chainsaws as the Park Service was cutting  out  the  huge  blowdown  on  the
trail as we went by. We hit the TH at11:50 (100 ft 3:45 hr).

We did cool off in  Ross  Lake,  then  had  a  late  lunch/early  supper  in
Bellingham before officially calling a close to  the  trip.   I  was  really
reluctant for it all to end. This is one trip I will  remember  for  a  long
time.

Total: Maybe 12 miles and 7800 ft in 3 days

Azurite Pk Quad - July 8-10, 2006

I had missed bagging Ballard when Annette and I climbed  Azurite  in  August
of 2005.  We were wiped out by the horrid, and non-existent above the  mine,
Mill Cr Trail and ran out of time and energy to do another peak.  So  I  was
eager  to  return  for  another   try.    The   peak   had   looked   fairly
straightforward  going  upslope  from  the  Azurite  Mine.    I   considered
approaching from the E over Cady Pass  this  time  and  sparing  myself  the
agonies of the Mill Cr Trail again, but the much longer drive put me off.

Day 1:  So once again I headed out from the Canyon Cr TH off  Hwy  20,  elev
1900 ft, at 10:50. The Chancellor Trail (as the trail that  goes  up  Canyon
Cr is called) is  still  officially  closed  after  the  junction  with  the
Boulder Cr Trail, 5  miles  in,  presumably  because  of  minor  sliding  of
portions of the trail as it descends steep hillside to  cross  Mill  Cr.  It
was no worse than last year and is certainly passable on foot with care  and
I arrived at the Mill Cr Trail junction, elev 2800 ft,  at  2:20  (6  miles,
1900 ft, 3.5 hr).

Now, because I wanted to go to inviting looking Cady Pass and  add  Cady  Pt
and Pk 7385 to the itinerary, I headed uphill toward the W ridge of the  Pt.
My pack was blessedly light compared to my previous  several  hard  climbing
trips.  The only climbing gear I carried was a very  short,  light  ice  axe
and a thin 60-foot scramble rope. The axe was never needed  but  I  did  use
the rope once and it gave me a psychological boost the rest of the time.  So
I climbed fairly easily through the mostly  brush  free  open  woods.   Then
what should I run into but an old trail. This was obviously  a  built  trail
that switchbacked back and forth across the ridge. Since I also ran into  an
old telephone wire I\'m guessing this trail led to the lookout that was  once
on Cady Pt. It was in reasonably good shape to begin, although the  resident
animal population did not take kindly  to  switchbacks  and  had  their  own
route straight up cutting across them, and it facilitated travel for a  1000
ft or so. Then I lost it in  a  snowbrushy  old  burn.  Some  unpleasantness
ensued before I broke out into open meadowy alpine terrain. The rest of  the
route was a ridge rambler\'s delight marred only by the ugly scar of the  old
mine road crossing Cady Pass. I topped out on Cady  Pt  at  6:15  (5500  ft,
7:25 hr).

From the Pt I wandered through idyllic meadows on the broad  ridge  to  Cady
Pass. It was so gorgeous I had to keep pinching myself to make  sure  I  was
not dreaming. I had originally planned to climb Pk 7385 and then  head  down
to a camp at the mine. But it was getting late, Pk 7385 looked a  long  ways
off and it was so beautiful I didn\'t want to hurry or leave.  There  were  a
few snow patches around to supply water so I decided to camp on  the  ridge.
How could I not? Flat roomy places to bivy, water nearby and  views  to  die
for.  After S Hozomeen last week what a concept! I found my  ideal  spot  at
7:20 and set up camp, elev 6000 ft (9.5 miles, 5500 ft, 8.5 hr)  enjoying  a
leisurely dinner in my picturesque surroundings.

Day 2: I started at 6:40 for Pk 7385, which presented  an  appealing  aspect
from my camp.  There was a few hundred feet of easy scrambling getting up  a
buttress but for the most part this was another rambler\'s  delight  directly
along the ridgecrest.  I reached the top at 8:10 (1.5 miles, 1500 ft,  1:30)
where the summit cairn was adorned by a broken shovel. Who but miners  would
carry a shovel up here?  I had a naÃ¯ve thought that perhaps I  could  follow
the ridge all the way to Ballard and thus save myself the descent into  Mill
Cr and allow another night in my idyllic spot, but one look and  I  knew  it
would not be possible. Darn! But then I really knew that would be  the  case
just by looking at the map. There was no help for it. So  I  broke  camp  at
10:00 and followed  the  mine  road  down.  I  was  soon  so  bored  by  the
interminable switchbacks and low gradient that I cut the  switchbacks  until
increasing brush forced me to stay on the track. Last year a dozer had  been
along the road smoothing things out and trampling down the brush.   No  such
luck this year and already lower down the brush was  closing  in  again  and
washouts cutting across as Nature reclaimed what was rightfully hers. I  saw
no signs that anyone had been this way, on machine or  foot,  since  Annette
and I. Except for bears.  There was bear scat  everywhere.  In  fact  coming
off of Pk 7385 I had come across fresh  bear  tracks  in  the  snow  -  very
fresh, as they hadn\'t been there on the way up.

I pulled into the campsite right next to the old mine  building,  elev  4600
ft, at 12:00 (4.5 miles, 500 ft, 2 hrs from camp 1). I was setting  up  camp
when I heard a great crash and rattling of corrugated metal from inside  the
shack. Something or someone big must surely  be  making  such  a  racket.  A
bear? A miner\'s ghost? Going to investigate it  turned  out  to  be  nothing
more than an innocuous marmot making noise all  out  of  proportion  to  its
size. I was just glad it wasn\'t a bear.

I left at 12:30 to climb Ballard, climbing up the left  side  of  the  large
open creek gully just up the road from camp. A short initial  class  3  wall
led past the first waterfalls, then it was  just  a  matter  of  working  up
endless class 2 loose rock  ledges  and  gullies  and  scree,  easy  if  not
pleasant. About half way up, I suddenly  noticed  that  my  blue  skies  had
clouded up and it looked as if it could  rain,  but  all  it  ever  did  was
sprinkle lightly. The clouds and few drops actually  felt  good  and  cooled
things off a bit.  At 6800 ft I crossed the creek  on  a  snow  remnant  and
worked right to the shoulder of  a  rib.   A  thousand  more  feet  of  very
unpleasant moveable scree and small talus led  to  the  base  of  the  rocky
summit ridge. A short class 3 section, with  maybe  a  few  class  4  moves,
brought me to the ridge itself and a look at the final summit  rocks.  Whoa!
This was a little more than the walkup I had expected.  It  reminded  me  of
Azurite, with ugly gullies and a series of pinnacles and me not  sure  which
was the highest, only on a smaller scale.

I worked along the base of the pinnacles, then up  a  gully  and  definitely
class 4 wall to the ridge line again, crossed the top  of  the  gully  at  a
notch, and climbed the next pinnacle to the  N.  Darn,  there  was  still  a
higher one farther N. Back down, traverse to another notch, up a  short  but
exposed class 4 step above the notch and I was on  top  at  4:40  (2  miles,
3800 ft, 4:10 from camp 2). I was surprised not to find a  register  in  the
summit cairn, but I had brought one to leave just in case.

I spent 20 minutes on top, then began down.   I  carefully  downclimbed  the
first class 4 step to the notch, but used my short rope on the  lower  class
4 wall. Then it was just reversing all the tedious loose  scree,  talus  and
gullies, slipping and sliding as I went.  To feet still not fully  recovered
from the battering they took on S  Hozomeen,  it  was  painful  business.  I
hobbled into camp at 8:00 (7:30 hrs)  with  badly  bruised  heels  and  feet
wondering how or if I would ever be able to make  the  10.5  miles  out  the
next day. (11.5 miles, 5800 ft, 13:20 hr for the day).

Day 3: I gratefully slept in till after 7:00 and started down the mine  road
at 8:30. At 9:00 I came to the "junction"  with  the  Mill  Cr  Trail.  This
junction is marked with a faded orange flag  but  there  is  no  sign  of  a
trail.  For the first 100 feet or so you just  have  to  crash  through  the
brush.  Good thing I had been on this trail before or  I  would  have  never
been able to find it. For 2 miles it goes in and out of brush, some  so  bad
as to seem impenetrable.  The only way to stay  on  track  is  to  part  the
brush down to the ground until you can see the tread and then  follow  this.
However, sections in the trees are still quite good. The  last  mile  or  so
breaks out onto open hot hillside but things do not  improve  as  ferns  and
thimbleberries and alder are traded for snowbrush as the dominant  irritant.
Much of the tread is also filling in on the loose sandy  hillside  and  soon
will be  completely  gone.  I  thankfully  reached  the  junction  with  the
Chancellor Trail at 11:30, after 2.5 hours of misery.

I ate lunch at the crossing of Mill Cr, soaked my  aching  feet  and  washed
up. The rest of the way  out  was  almost  pleasant  by  comparison,  or  as
pleasant as a trail can be when you are tired, your feet hurt  and  all  you
want is to get out. Despite many ups and downs, this is really a  very  nice
trail.  Most of it is in cool forest and a refreshing breeze was blowing.  I
was in no hurry and stopped once more to soak my feet. I reached the  TH  at
3:30 (10.5 miles, 1050 ft, 7 hr).

Total: 31.5 miles and 12,350 ft in 3 days

Majestic Mtn (7520+ ft - 680P), Pk 7510 ("Majestic End" - 430P) & McKay
Ridge (7000+ ft - 760P) - Azurite Pk Quad - July 14-16, 2006

I like ridges, especially high alpine ridges, and even when they go  up  and
down unnecessarily, as ridges are wont to do, I still like ridges.   I  like
the feeling of treading that space  between  heaven  and  earth  and  having
constant views in every direction. So when I saw  the  long  Majestic  Ridge
across Mill Cr from Cady Ridge last week it just called to me. At that  time
if I could have I would have accessed it from  Azurite  Mine  and  gone  out
that way. But I could see no reasonable way up out of Mill Cr. It  was  just
as well.  I was too beat, the  ridge  was  longer  than  it  looked  and  it
deserved a trip of its own. Then I discovered two other  peaks  of  interest
nearby, Pk 7510 at the N end of the ridge that would  make  a  fitting  turn
around point for my traverse, and McKay Ridge on the other side  of  Boulder
Cr. Now I had a full itinerary and a definite plan.

Day 1: I began from the East Cr TH, elev 2600 ft, off Hwy 20 at  12:30.  The
trail dropped to cross Granite Cr on a large bridge  then  climbed  steadily
for a thousand feet up semi open hillside where spindly small  firs  offered
little shade. Fortunately, this day was not terribly hot so I didn\'t  suffer
too much. The tread is  in  good  shape  although  there  are  a  number  of
annoying blowdowns that have not yet been cut.  After  another  gentle  mile
through cool forest the first water is reached at a crossing of East  Cr  on
a log. On the other side, the trail changes character becoming brushier  and
several side streams are crossed  before  reaching  the  marked  Boulder  Cr
Trail junction (4 miles, 2300 ft, 3 hrs). This trail is  not  shown  on  the
USGS map but is on the GT Mt Logan.

I easily followed the trail, crossing the line of an interesting old  6-inch
metal pipe (did they pump water up from East Cr?), to the  Gold  Hill  Mine,
elev 5000 ft. There are several buildings, a lot  of  disturbed  ground  and
much equipment strewn around, some of it looking fairly new,  that  confused
the situation as to  where  the  continuation  of  the  trail  went.  Seeing
nothing obvious, I headed up left of the main shack  figuring  I  would  run
into the trail.  I did run into what I thought was the trail  a  short  ways
up, but it soon petered out in a meadow. So I just headed up the meadow  and
when that became too brushy aimed for  the  forest  to  the  left.   I  kept
expecting to run into the trail again but I never did.  This  probably  cost
me close to an hour in time. At  about  5800  ft  I  began  traversing  left
toward Boulder Cr Pass, crossing three gullies on the way. The last one  had
water and not at all sure that there would be any at the pass  I  filled  up
my gallon container. At  5:45 I reached the pass, elev  6400  ft  (6  miles,
3900 ft, 5:15 hr). The trail distinctly ran through  the  pass.  How  did  I
miss it?

What a lovely spot! Two old fire rings each with a  nice  flat  spot  for  a
tent gave me a choice for my campsite. Neither looked  very  used.  However,
as I had feared there was no water - all snowpatches were gone. There was  a
gorgeous view of Ragged Ridge across Hwy 20 and up East Cr where a  striking
peak caught my attention at the head of the valley near Meebee  Pass.   What
was this peak? It was not named on my map  but  I  later  found  out  it  is
called the Methow Pinnacles. I had a leisurely dinner and turned in  at  the
absurd hour of 7:30.

Day 2: Despite my early retirement, I slept soundly until 6:00, 10.5  hours!
 My schedule must be getting to me. The morning was cooler than  I  expected
(40 degrees inside my bivy tent) with a heavy dew. Being high on a  ridge  I
had expected the sun to hit early,  but  it  was  blocked  by  Pt  7450  and
besides it was cloudy with fog swirling around the higher peaks. It took  me
a full hour of moving to warm up completely.  (I  had  gone  very  light  on
clothes expecting conditions to be as warm as  my  last  three  trips.  Just
goes to show, never count on anything in the mountains.)

I started up the ridge E of camp at 7:30 arriving on Pt 7450 an hour  later.
I stayed on the crest of the ridge as I would for all of the day.  I  looked
for a shortcut to the saddle with Majestic Mtn but it was too cliffy. So  it
was down 350 ft and back up to the summit of Majestic (1450 ft, 2 hr).  Here
I found a film can register, not  in  the  summit  cairn  but  several  feet
downhill from it. I was lucky to have spotted it.  Inside on a  soggy  piece
of paper were two entries. It was  originally  placed  by  Don  Goodman  and
company on October 24, 1987, "the year of the drought" (they must  have  had
to haul water a long ways that time of year in a drought no  less).  One  of
the party referred to this summit as "Truly Majestic",  which  gave  me  the
idea of calling my 7510 peak at the N end of the ridge "Majestic  End".  The
other entry was August 18, 1991. This peak hadn\'t been climbed in  15  years
if you believe the register. Sure it is not a major  objective,  but  it  is
not difficult and very scenic.  Maybe  some  others  just  didn\'t  find  the
register. Oh there was one other entry but I didn\'t think  it  counted.   On
July 16, 1990 two helicopter personal set a radio relay  for  the  Jack  Mtn
Complex Fire. I left a register of my own, transcribing all the entries.

For the next 3 hours I threaded my way N along the ridge toward Pk 7510.  At
times it looked as if I surely had come to an impasses,  but  a  way  always
appeared, always on the very crest and never  more  than  class  3.  It  was
ridge scrambling at its best and I enjoyed every minute of  it.  Views  were
not as good as I had hoped to begin, with persistent  clouds  and  fog,  but
gradually things cleared and I felt on top of the world. I went up and  over
two more major points and numerous smaller ones. Between  Majestic  and  the
next point I spotted several lovely tarns (not shown on the map) in a  basin
below. There were a few snow patches here and there that I was able  to  use
to augment my meager water supply. It was much farther to Pk  7510  than  it
looked on the map with many ups and downs. Finally  I  made  the  summit  at
12:30 (2800 ft, 5 hrs).

I spent a good hour on top just enjoying myself and the  spectacular  views.
Then I retraced my steps to the first point S and dropped into the basin  to
the W. It would take too long to reverse the entire ridge and besides I  had
to find another source of water for camp.  I  traversed  at  about  6600  ft
over a shoulder and dropped further to 6000 ft into the next drainage  where
I found a running creek and filled up my  gallon  container.  The  next  and
last drainage had no water at the elevation I crossed it, although  I  could
hear and see water a couple hundred feet lower. I traversed to  the  Boulder
Cr Trail, which I could see in the distance and followed it back up  to  the
pass and camp (6 miles, 3800 ft, 8:45 hrs).

Fifteen minutes later I was off again at 4:30 to  climb  McKay  Ridge.  This
was another ridge scrambling delight going W from camp. Again  I  stayed  on
the crest of the ridge the whole way, except for the  last  200  ft  to  the
summit on the SE face which was cruddy scree. There were the usual  ups  and
downs, but much less than on Majestic Ridge, with little surprises  and  fun
scrambling sections here and there. I reached the summit at 6:30  (1300  ft,
2 hrs). I was very surprised to find an official large Mountaineer  register
on top but when I read the one and only entry I understood.  It  was  placed
by none other than Ian MacKay on 7/26/03. How appropriate.  I  was  back  in
camp at 8:20 (4 miles, 2000 ft, 3:50 hrs) more than ready to  quit  for  the
day.

Day 3: Another cold morning, but it helped that I slept  in  till  7:30  and
the sun hit camp an hour later.  I  lounged  around  reading  and  sketching
Ragged Ridge while a resident deer made an appearance paying me no mind  and
a curious marmot watched from a rock lookout  while  I  painted.  I  finally
left at 10:45 following the trail down. Darn! It was a good  trail  all  the
way. It had begun to the right of the main mine building about 100 ft  up  a
bulldozed track, completely unmarked. I had been to the left  and  below  it
all the way up. I ambled the rest of  the  way  out,  stopping  for  a  long
lunch, and reached the TH at 2:15 (6 miles, 200 ft, 3:30 hrs)

Total: 22 miles and 9900 ft in 3 days

Never have I had so many things go wrong on a trip,  with  close  calls  and
uncertain outcomes, and still have a  successful  conclusion.  In  spite  of
that, I would have to rank this trip as one of my best ever and very  likely
the high point of my "climbing career". The hard climbing,  the  spectacular
scenery and most of all the working together as a team to make it  happen  -
it just doesn\'t get any better.

Day 1: The cast of characters in this drama were Paul Michelson, Stu  Frink,
Tim Jackson, Annette Day, Craig Day, David Diehl, Jon Zak,  and  of  course,
myself. After spending the night at a motel in Chilliwack, the eight  of  us
started from the end of the Depot Cr road at 8:00, elev  2500  ft  with  the
day already heating up.  The  first  near  miss  occurred  just  before  the
waterfall when Tim almost took his eye out on  a  sharp  protruding  branch.
With blood streaming out of his eye we were all relieved to  determine  that
it actually came from a gash near the eyebrow. His glasses  may  have  saved
him worse damage even though they were knocked off  his  head  and  it  took
quite a while to find them again.

The waterfall was running at high capacity, higher than any of us  had  ever
seen it before, and it was  like  climbing  in  a  full  blast  downpour  on
terribly slick wet rock. By the time we got through  this  section  we  were
all drenched. At the top of the waterfall we had planned on  splitting  into
two groups, with Craig, Jon  and  David  heading  to  Ouzel  Lake  to  climb
Custer, Rahm and Spickard while the rest of us  hoped  to  take  the  direct
route to the Redoubt Glacier. But we couldn\'t get across  roaring  Depot  Cr
and so everyone ended up going to  the  lake.  Even  then  we  couldn\'t  get
across the outlet and had to go uplake to find a place to wade across.  Here
we left the other three and the five  of  us  made  our  way  up  the  rocky
buttress W of the lake on ledges and onto the Redoubt Glacier.  By  now  the
heat was beginning to take its toll and some members were ready to  stop  at
the first available flat spot, but we pushed on  to  a  delightful  spot  at
7200 ft near rock outcroppings with  slab  benches  for  seats  and  running
water. We shoveled tent platforms in the snow for our three  tents  and  set
up a pleasant camp at 7:00 (8 miles, 4900 ft, 11 hrs)

Day 2 - Hard Mox: Paul, Tim, Stu and I started for Hard Mox  at  6:20.  From
the 7200 Redoubt-Depot Cr ridge we dropped several  hundred  feet  on  snow,
talus and scree and began a long traverse until we could climb  back  up  to
the Col of the Wild between the two Moxes at 7840 ft (1200  ft,  1:45  hrs).
The last bit to the col was gosh awful loose, loose scree. From  the  col  a
ramp led right past a tiny snowpatch, around a  corner  and  into  a  gully.
From the top of the gully a short class 4 wall, with a rappel anchor  above,
was climbed to a series of loose ledges up and right to  a  sharp  notch  in
the Ridge of Gendarmes. Somewhere in here I was almost taken out by a  large
rock. Here we had our first real look at Hard Mox. Oh my gosh!  What  had  I
gotten myself into! It really looked unclimbable.

From the notch we descended a couple hundred  of  feet  on  exposed  ledges,
where a few cairns helped to point the way, to a snowfinger. Both  the  snow
itself and the rock on the side were  most  unappealing,  so  we  set  up  a
single rope rappel to get down another hundred feet almost to  the  base  of
the snow. Going off this rappel I clumsily dropped my ATC rappel  device  (I
still don\'t know how the keeper came off the carabiner.). While not a  total
disaster, not having my ATC would have severely hampered  both  my  belaying
and rappelling. But sharp-eyed Tim spotted it a short ways farther down  the
gully and all was saved. From the base of the snow  we  traversed  left  and
into the  second  of  two  converging  gullies  where  we  came  across  the
chockstone chimney. After going  under  the  chockstone,  we  encountered  a
short wall were we began roped climbing as two independent ropes,  Paul  and
I and Tim and Stu. I led up the wall and into bed of the gully but was  soon
stopped by another steep chimney with a cave in the back. Perhaps some  long
legged guys can stem this thing but not I, so I found a way  around  on  the
right wall and back into the gully above. Rockfall  is  a  real  problem  in
this gully and we all had to be extremely careful.

At noon (2000 ft, 5:40 hrs) we reached the high notch below  the  Spire\'s  W
wall, where the "serious"  climbing  supposedly  begins  (as  if  it  wasn\'t
serious up to now). Paul took the lead following a ledge right and  up  then
back left around a corner to a belay anchor. I took the next  lead  more  or
less following  the  ridge  crest.  I  didn\'t  find  the  climbing  so  much
difficult as just plain stressful. The  rock  was  quite  loose  and  I  had
trouble finding  solid  holds  and  particularly  solid  places  to  put  in
protection. Following, Paul had a foothold completely break  on  him,  which
got his adrenaline flowing. Paul took us the last easier bit to  the  summit
at 1:50 (2200 ft, 7:30 hrs). We were both elated to have made  this  elusive
peak.

The summit register was a  fascinating  complete  climbing  history  of  the
peak, including pasted in photocopies of the first ascent by Fred and  Helmy
Beckey in 1941. Ours was the 22nd ascent right after Paul  Klenke  and  Mark
Iffrig in 2004. The register read like a Who\'s Who of  Bulger  climbers  and
averaged an ascent every  other  year  or  so  recently,  with  larger  gaps
earlier.

Tim and Stu joined us a short time later and then we began the rappels  down
using our two 60m ropes. The  first  rappel  went  smoothly.  Then  disaster
struck. On the second rappel down to the high notch, when pulling the  ropes
the upper rope got stuck just shortly  after  the  knot  reached  us.  Three
strong guys couldn\'t get it down. It was now 4:00, time was an issue and  we
really didn\'t have enough to climb up  to  free  it,  so  we  cut  the  rope
leaving us with a somewhat useless 30 ft remnant. Naturally it was  my  rope
and it was brand new. I really didn\'t care that much about the rope per  se.
 But I did recognize that having only one rope would  severely  handicap  us
on the rest of the rappels on this peak and also for climbing Easy  Mox  the
next day. But if anyone climbs Hard Mox  soon  there  is  a  nice  50m  rope
dangling in the wind.

And so we were forced into a series of single rope rappels to get  down  the
gully. By the time we got back to the Col  of  the  Wild  it  was  9:00.  We
dragged into camp at 10:40 by headlamp where Annette,  bless  her,  pampered
us by having hot water ready for dinner (3100 ft, 16:15 hrs).

Day 3 - Easy Mox: What a misnomer! Easy Mox is not  easy.   I  have  decided
these two peaks should be called Hard Mox and Harder Mox. Worn out from  our
previous day, Tim bowed out and Annette joined us. We got a  late  start  at
8:30 and descended a couple hundred feet to get below rock ribs onto  the  E
lobe of the Redoubt Glacier. This lobe is heavily crevassed and  requires  a
rope to cross (we didn\'t bother roping up on the way up to  camp  on  the  W
edge of the glacier). Then we got a look at the route  up  to  the  N  ridge
notch. The snow, which was supposed to give easy access to a ramp  that  cut
right and then left leading to broken rock to the ridge, had  receded  to  a
nasty moat and jumble of unstable broken blocks  of  ice.  There  was  brief
talk of working our way through the jumble to the ramp but as if on cue  one
of the blocks came crashing down almost as we spoke putting the nix on  that
idea.

With no other option, I took the lead across the  left  edge  of  the  moat,
where it was easy to cross, and onto the rock and essentially went  straight
up to the left trending ramp, maybe an 80 ft pitch. I  would  say  this  was
the hardest climbing of the whole trip and certainly the crux for Easy  Mox.
The rock was solid, but slabby and hard to protect and I was  definitely  at
my limit.  I remember distinctly thinking while making  one  of  the  harder
moves on a somewhat runout  partial  traverse,  "Don\'t  fall!  Please  don\'t
fall! It would really suck to fall right now and would probably put  an  end
to the trip not to mention what it would do to my body." Paul  was  thinking
the same thing and planning to reel in the rope as fast as possible  if  the
worst did happen. Somehow I made it to the  ramp  and  breathed  a  sigh  of
relief. It is amazing what adrenaline can make us capable of doing.

There was another easy pitch, in comparison, to  the  broad  7600  ft  ridge
(250 ft, 4:30 hrs).
We scrambled a ways along the  easy  ridge  until  coming  to  a  step  that
required an exposed traverse around a corner. It was now  2:00  and  it  was
becoming obvious that 4 people on one rope was awkward and slow and  at  our
present pace we would not make the summit. So we took Annette off  the  rope
at a safe spot and continued as a rope of  three.   She  was  naturally  not
happy but did understand and in the spirit of  making  the  best  of  a  bad
situation decided to start a new list "The 100 Highest Lunch Spots."

With three on the rope things went faster as we simulclimbed. There was  one
more traverse left around a step, but most of  the  way  was  right  on  the
crest which was getting narrower and more exposed  the  higher  we  went.  I
rather enjoyed this ridge.  The  rock  was  fairly  solid  and  it  was  fun
scrambling. About 200 ft from the summit we reached a  series  of  pinnacles
that required a 40 ft descent left down a steep gully  to  a  rubble  ledge,
which was followed to directly below the summit. A 100 ft class 5 pitch  put
us at a tiny high notch with a final easy scramble remaining to the  summit,
which was reached at 4:30 (1100 ft, 8 hrs). We barely took time to  look  at
the soggy and illegible register before heading down.

We rappelled down to the rubble ledge  and  downclimbed  the  rest  back  to
Annette and on to the notch where we left the  ridge.   We  had  passed  two
rappel anchors on the way up. From the second anchor a  double  rope  rappel
would have made it to the glacier, but of course we didn\'t  have  two  ropes
and I found myself stranded  on  the  slabby  ramp  with  no  obvious  third
anchor. After searching for more time than we could afford  to  lose  I  was
getting desperate. There was some discussion about tying the  rope  off  and
rappelling on a single strand  (which  meant  we  would  have  to  leave  it
behind) but we really couldn\'t afford to lose another rope. We needed it  to
cross the glacier and for Redoubt the next day.  There  were  better  things
to leave behind than the rope. After much searching I found a shallow  crack
that would just allow a thin spectra sling to hang on it and  a  bomber  cam
crack nearby. By equalizing these two points I felt it was  safe  enough  to
rappel from. This got us to the glacier below at 8:30 and back  to  camp  at
10:15 (1600 ft, 13:45 hrs) for another late dinner. Let\'s see now -  so  far
I had lost my 60m rope, a cam, a spectra sling  and  Paul  almost  lost  his
rope. This trip was being decidedly hard on gear.

Day 4 - Mt Redoubt: The other three members of our party had  come  up  from
the lake the previous night to join us at our glacier  camp.  They  had  all
climbed Spickard, backed off the nasty Custer ridge  and  David  had  soloed
Rahm. Jon had climbed Redoubt before and stayed  in  camp  so  seven  of  us
headed for that peak at 7:30. We climbed the glacier to the 7800 ft notch  S
of the imposing Flying Buttress. A short class 4 pitch led to a  descent  on
loose talus down the other side and a traverse to a snow gully on  Redoubt\'s
S slope. We ended up going up the gully too far (beware the  fallible  human
memory of someone  who  has  previously  climbed  a  mountain)  and  had  to
backtrack to the snowslope on the left and a broad scree  shoulder.  A  ramp
above went right below the summit cliffs.  There  were  several  choices  of
gullies to take from the ramp and we chose one near its end,  evidently  not
the correct one. This put us below a final steep cliff just below the top.

Tim led up this cliff, a solid class 5 pitch which was much harder than  any
of us had anticipated. We must be  off  route.  The  plan  for  everyone  to
follow this on our one rope using a prusik was not  going  to  work.  On  to
Plan B. Tim belayed me and Paul up to his stance, which was an  easy  50  ft
scramble across a narrow notch to the summit (2200 ft, 5 hrs). We then  tied
off the rope at a rappel anchor near the summit and I rappelled on a  single
strand down from the notch where what should I discover but the  Cannonhole.
We had gone over the top of it! I then went down and to climber\'s left  over
a shoulder. It was an awkward  rappel  and  I  had  to  place  a  couple  of
direction slings to keep the rope on the right line but it was  much  easier
than the way Tim had gone. The rest of the party was now able to  follow  on
prusik. Everyone but Tim rappelled down the single  line.  Tim  then  did  a
normal rappel down his face lead so we could retrieve the rope.

There were no further problems, other than taking great care  with  rockfall
downclimbing the gully and we were all back to camp by 5:45 (2500 ft,  10:15
hrs). There has been talk earlier about some people going out  this  day  (I
had always planned to spend a fifth  day)  but  now  no  one  wanted  to  go
anywhere. Each of these peaks had taken more time and  been  more  difficult
than anyone had expected. There were multiple cell phone  calls  to  arrange
another day with work and family.  And for once we had  a  leisurely  dinner
in daylight and got to bed at a reasonable hour.

Day 5: We got up with the sun at 6:00 and were packed and ready to leave  at
7:30. Both the feeder creeks to the lake and the waterfall  were  noticeably
lower in volume. We reached the cars at 2:00 (8 miles, 300  ft,  .6:30  hrs)
everyone looking forward to a dip in Chilliwack Lake.  But this is  not  the
end of the story.  We never got the dip in the lake.  David\'s  van  died  on
the way down (fortunately he was past the Depot Cr  road).  He  had  a  dead
battery. Perhaps it was the alternator. At any rate the  vehicle  would  not
run. He limped into Chilliwack by me giving him  a  jump  and  charging  his
battery from my Cherokee a few minutes a time. Each charge would  allow  him
to drive 3-4 miles before the engine died again.   I  must  have  given  him
close to 10 jumps before making it into town and a car  repair  place.  They
said they probably couldn\'t get to it until the next day. (It did  turn  out
to be the alternator and both David and his van made it home the next  day.)
I drove 5 people home. The others made arrangements to be  picked  up  by  a
family member. A rather ignominious end  to  an  interesting,  eventful  and
challenging trip, but it will not change my opinion  that  this  could  very
well be my best climb ever.

Total: Maybe 30 miles and 12,400 ft in 5 days

Illabot Peaks (5944 ft - 2864P) & Peak 4680+ (480P) - Illabot Peaks Quad


Fizzle Hill (1760+ ft - 600P) & Wall Mtn (2250 ft - 650P) - Rockport Quad

July 31-August 1, 2006

I know that most people climb Illabot Peaks  from  the  north  in  one  day.
Looking at the map and reading Stefan\'s recent report  going  that  way  did
not  appeal  to  me.  Ever  since  skiing  up  Suiattle  Mtn  this   winter,
approaching from the end of the West Boundary Road  and  climbing  from  the
south appeared more scenic and since I wanted  to  do  it  as  an  overnight
several tarns on the way would provide a nice place to camp.

Day 1: Since the approach to  my  proposed  camp  would  be  very  short,  I
planned to also climb as many little bumps along the road on the way  in  as
possible. My first objective was Fizzle Hill, on which I almost  fizzled.  I
wandered back and forth along the main road looking for a  spur  that  would
get me as close as possible.  I finally settled on a  very  short  one  less
than half a mile from the top. (I ran into a road part  way  up  that  would
have halved the misery but darned if  I  could  figure  out  where  it  came
from.) I will not go into detail as I doubt anyone will ever  follow  in  my
footsteps up this horrendous pile  of  stickery  head  high  brushy  logging
slash and if anyone should be crazy (stupid) enough to try they  can  figure
it out for themselves. Suffice it to say it took me 2:50 hrs to go  the  750
ft and 1 mile RT and I ended up wet, dirty, all scratched up and in  a  foul
mood.

Wall Mtn was next and a slight improvement.  At  least  the  summit  was  in
forest and had several cute rocky promontories with  a  vista  down  to  the
Sauk River (1.5 miles, 800 ft, 1:45 hrs). Neither  of  these  two  bumps  is
really worth the effort unless you are a terminal peak bagger (What? Who  me
you say?)

I continued driving to the end of the West Boundary Road past  Suiattle  Mtn
to the saddle E of Peak 4680. The  road  actually  continues  a  short  ways
farther than shown on the map up the spur ridge to the E  and  I  gratefully
drove as far as possible.  It was now so late (5:30) and I was so  worn  out
from my brush bashes that I worried about getting to  a  camp  in  a  timely
manner. I needn\'t have worried. The route along the spur ridge went  swiftly
through the open forest despite a large number of  fallen  trees  along  the
way.  I had half expected to find a reasonable fisherman\'s  trail  to  Tupso
Lake, but all I found  was  a  faint  path  sporadically  marked  with  blue
flagging. At the main ridge I dropped over the other side  to  a  collection
of three lovely tarns, elev 4650 ft, and set up a pleasant camp at  6:50  (1
mile, 725 ft, 1:20 hr). The  mosquitoes  were  ferocious,  but  anticipating
this I had brought along a large netting and placed it over the entrance  to
my tent for a bug free place to make and eat dinner. There was  no  sign  of
anyone ever having camped here.

Day 2: I slept in and didn\'t get going until 8:00.  It was  nice  to  be  so
relaxed and not in a hurry. I began by wandering N through meadows.  Soon  I
ran into a very good boot trail.  I  followed  it  a  short  ways  until  it
headed to the left of the ridge ahead.  I wanted to go to the  right  so  we
parted ways.  This must be a continuation of the fisherman\'s trail  to  Lake
Louise going on to Lake Tupso. I took the  traverse  around  the  ridge  too
low, ran into cliffs and had to drop to bypass  them  until  I  could  climb
back up again. Turning the ridge I came upon two  more  tarns  at  5120  ft.
From here I dropped once more until I could gain the 5080 ft saddle  to  the
left of an impressive rocky ridge where I  had  my  first  view  of  Illabot
Peaks.

After another drop into the basin on the other side, I began working my  way
to the W ridge of my peak. I was mistakenly under the  impression  that  you
then just follow this ridge to the  top.   No  can  do.  It  is  rocky  with
several bumps and gaps and it is best to traverse below on the S side  until
reaching a rock wall just below the summit.  From here I was uncertain  what
to do. There were cliffs everywhere  and  no  sign  of  the  class  3  gully
mentioned in Beckey.  I hadn\'t brought Stefan\'s report with me and  couldn\'t
remember exactly what he had said.  I should have  paid  more  attention.  I
hadn\'t expected such difficulties. I ended up crossing to  the  N  side  and
forcing a way up a very steep treed slope to the right of  a  slab  where  I
could use limbs to pull myself up. I topped out at 11:00  (1.5  miles,  1850
ft, 3:00 hrs).

The summit is supposed to be a good viewpoint but  I  could  see  little  as
clouds and fog obscured all the higher peaks and  many  of  the  lower  ones
too.  Too much marine air still around from  Sunday\'s  system.   Even  so  I
spent an hour on top and even wandered over to the E summit.  After  leaving
a register, I started down a different way, staying on the ridge as long  as
possible.  I managed to downclimb almost all the  way  until  I  came  to  a
steep chimney, which I rappelled with my 80 ft  rope.  The  rest  was  easy.
From the upper tarns I climbed to the ridge crest, where I could  look  down
on Lake Louise, for a higher route back to camp to miss the  cliffs  of  the
way up. I reached camp at 2:00 (2400 ft, 6 hrs RT) and relaxed for  over  an
hour before heading out, reaching the car at 4:15 (1 mile, 270 ft, 1 hr).

I still had time to climb Peak 4680.  This  turned  out  to  be  a  pleasant
though steep climb through mostly brushfree  woods.  The  hardest  part  was
finding a way up the road cut. I left a small matchbox register  on  top  in
honor of this being the only secondary bump on this trip worth climbing  (.5
miles, 520 ft, 1 hr RT).

Total for all peaks: 8 miles and 5465 ft in 2 days

Sinister Peak (8440+ ft - 840P - Dome Pk Quad) - August 5-7, 2006


Via the South Side and SW Ridge


This was my second attempt on this peak  this  year,  the  first  one  being
thwarted by bad weather. That meant that once again  I  had  to  endure  the
enervating approach up Downey and Bachelor  Creeks.  I  was  definitely  not
looking forward to it but there was no other alternative other than to  grit
my teeth and bear it. Much as I dislike this approach it is the fastest  way
in to Sinister.

Day 1: And so 8:00 on  Saturday  morning  found  our  party  of  four,  Paul
Michelson, Tim Jackson, Paul Klenke and I, starting up the Downey Cr  Trail,
elev 1400 ft. Three hours later we were at Bachelor Cr, elev  2400  ft,  and
stopped for lunch  (6.5 miles, 1350 ft) before heading up  the  Bachelor  Cr
Trail with its  notorious  windfalls  and  brush.  The  blackflies  on  this
section were atrocious, so thick that during rest  stops  my  light  colored
pants took on a dark polka-dotted pattern. Then Tim  was  stung  by  a  wasp
when a nest was disturbed by our passage. Also the brush  was  fully  leafed
out now and much thicker than when I was last here in early June.  No,  this
"trail" is not a whole lot of fun.

On the avalanche slope at the head of the  valley,  Klenke  was  ahead  (his
usual position) by a couple hundred feet when he called  down  that  he  had
just seen a cougar. Darn! I would have liked to have seen that. What a  rare
and special occurrence!  In all my years of wandering I have  never  seen  a
cougar in the wild. Above the avalanche we picked up  good  tread  again  in
open country, crossed Cub Lake Pass, dropped to Cub  Lake  and  climbed  the
last thousand feet to a delightful camp on Itswoot Ridge, elev 6300  ft  (14
miles, 5800 ft, 9:30 hrs). We had the whole place to ourselves  and  it  was
early  enough  to  wash  up  in  the  nearby  creek,  relax  and  enjoy  the
spectacular views all around before eating a leisurely  dinner  and  turning
in at 8:30.

Day 2: Tim, who is not fanatically pursuing  the  100  Highest,  decided  to
spend the day taking it easy. So Michelson, Klenke and I took  off  at  6:00
and left him to enjoy the ambience and beauty of the area.  We  dropped  off
the ridge several hundred  feet  before  beginning  a  long,  very  l-o-n-g,
traverse beneath the south slopes of Dome Peak  just  to  get  to  Sinister.
Sinister was not even in sight for a long time. We  traversed  at  generally
between 6000 and 6200 ft on talus and scree  and  heather  to  the  polished
slabs below the icefall on the Dome Glacier. These slabs  were  rather  fun,
but the rest was just tedious, slow going over loose unstable rocks. At  one
point Michelson  stepped  onto  a  loose  boulder  that  rolled  under  foot
pitching him forward downhill bruising his knee and  breaking  the  tip  off
his trekking pole. After a few minutes to collect himself, he determined  he
was able to continue, but it was a close call.

Once past the slabs, we climbed up past two small snow patches to a 7000  ft
saddle in Dome\'s SW Ridge (1100 ft, 2:15 hrs). The snow was  ice  hard,  but
we could bypass it on rock.  Any extended snow travel at  this  point  would
require crampons so we tried to avoid that until it had a chance  to  soften
up. More tedious traversing continued on the other side  of  the  SW  Ridge,
only broken by the crossing of a roaring glacial creek in a  deep  slot.  We
barely made it across, and I did get one wet foot.  We  knew  this  crossing
would give us trouble on the way back when the volume would be much higher.

At 9:15 (1400 ft, 3:15 hrs) we reached "the  Impasse"  on  the  S  Ridge  of
Dome, elev 7000 ft, where we had our first view of Sinister. It took  us  an
hour to find "the Ramp" and figure out a way down the cliffs  on  the  other
side. We even briefly considered rappelling. Actually there are a couple  of
ways down, but they are hard to discern from above.  We  began  on  a  steep
heather trough. Then Klenke went skier\'s right on a narrow ledge to a  broad
slabby ramp (is this "the Ramp"?) ending up lower,  while  Michelson  and  I
went skier\'s left on a ledge (or is this "the  Ramp"?)  that  curled  around
leading to a snowslope below which  we  then  took  down  to  meet  up  with
Klenke. We could now finally begin the climb up to Sinister.

A  broad  gully  led  up  through  cliffs  to  the  gentle  snowfield  below
Sinister\'s W Face. All we had to do now was find "the Gully" leading to  the
W Ridge, but of course the proper, supposedly class 3, gully was not at  all
obvious and the route descriptions we had were vague and not  that  helpful.
We bypassed one gully  that  looked  much  too  steep  to  be  class  3  (in
retrospect this was probably the correct one)  and  continued  traversing  S
below cliffs almost to the SW Ridge where a deep gully  at  the  head  of  a
short but steep snowslope slanted to the left.  I  donned  my  crampons  and
went up to take a look. A nasty moat greeted me at the  top  with  a  10  ft
vertical wall on the other side. Warning my  companions  not  to  come  this
way, I now had to extricate myself from  my  predicament.   This  I  did  by
straddling the snow lip until I found a spot I could  frontpoint  down  into
the moat.

My companions soon joined me by crawling the moat  on  the  right  side.  We
could now see that the left trending gully appeared to end  in  a  headwall.
However, after a short rock step, an easy ramp led right to a notch  in  the
SW Ridge.  Klenke led up the maybe 5.0 step, brought the two of us up,  then
I followed the ramp to the SW Ridge. It was now  obvious  we  were  way  off
route and had completely missed the W Ridge, but it appeared that  we  could
continue on our ridge to the top and we had little choice at this point  but
to give it a go. It actually turned out to be a nice route, mostly  class  3
and 4, with a few harder moves here and there, on reasonable  rock  that  we
simul-climbed on our two 30m ropes. I lead for a couple hundred  feet  until
running out of pro (we didn\'t bring that much as  we  didn\'t  expect  to  do
this much rock climbing) then leapfrogged with Klenke taking us the rest  of
the way. The last bit was easy scree and we  summitted  at  2:45  (3500  ft,
8:45 hrs).

We congratulated each other. This was #92 for Klenke, #98 for Michelson  and
#99 for me. Amongst the three of us  we  had  climbed  289  Hundred  Highest
Peaks. The register still contained the original first ascent entry  of  May
29,1939  by  Lloyd  Anderson,  Jim  Crooks  and  Clint  Kelley  on  an   old
Mountaineer roll. It was dry but tattered and torn and  in  bad  shape.   We
left the tatters for historic reasons but added a  new  waterproof  booklet.
As an aside, I had climbed several  peaks  with  Clint  Kelley  back  in  my
Mountaineer days in the â70s before he was killed by a fall on Mt Shuksan.

We left the summit at 3:30 and headed down the W Ridge. I was  surprised  at
how easy this ridge was.  We were able to bypass any snow  on  the  left  on
scree and talus and it was mostly a simple walk to the rappel  anchor  at  a
point where the ridge narrows just before the  Dome-Sinister  Col.  However,
this rappel was anything but simple.  I would have to rate it as one of  the
worst starts to a rappel I have ever done. It was very awkward, as  you  had
to walk out to climber\'s left of the anchor, which then  put  you  above  an
overhang with the anchor off to the right.  Once you  step  off  into  space
you then pendulum right in a freefall and hang on for dear life.  No, I  did
not like that rappel. Also our two 30m ropes did not quite make it  all  the
way down and left us 20 feet short above another  nasty  moat.  Klenke  went
first and somehow levitated himself down the last  bit  and  over  the  moat
onto the snow. Being mere mortals, Michelson and  I  set  up  another  short
rappel, after which I threw the other end of  the  rope  to  Klenke  and  he
pulled me over the moat.

We quickly glissaded the snow as far as possible, downclimbed  to  the  base
of âthe Impasse" and took Klenke\'s route up slippery slabs and deadly  steep
heather.  I liked Michelson\'s and my downroute better. The rest of  the  way
back is a bit of a blur of endless traversing, although two events  made  it
through the blur. First, the crossing of the roaring creek  was  as  bad  as
expected.  We could not cross in the same place  as  earlier.   It  was  not
just a question of getting wet feet; it was a question of being  swept  away
over waterfalls to a possible death. So we went  uphill  to  where  we  were
lucky to find a crossing below a snowbridge on boulders.  I  ended  up  with
two wet feet and Klenke had to haul me up a sheer rock  step,  but  it  sure
beat the alternative. Then second, while crossing the slabs below  the  Dome
Icefall a chunk of ice the size of an automobile broke  off.  The  sound  of
ice falling is a sound that strikes terror in the hearts  of  all  climbers.
Fortunately the ice stopped well above us but  the  adrenaline  rush  kicked
all our tired bodies into a higher gear  that  lasted  until  clear  of  the
glacier.

We didn\'t quite make it back to camp without needing headlamps,  pulling  in
at 9:45 (maybe 8 miles, 5100 ft, 15:45 hrs). We  now  had  company.  Another
party, already in bed, coming off the Ptarmigan Traverse was camped  nearby,
planning on climbing Dome the next day. Tim had made their acquaintance.  He
also had hot water ready  for  our  dinner,  which  we  devoured  ravenously
before turning in an hour later.

Day 3: Not much to be said for the trip out except  that  it  was  long  and
once again not a lot of fun. Once at Downey Cr I  decided  not  to  try  and
keep up with my long-legged companions, went at my  own  pace  and  probably
reached the car a good 30 minutes after everyone else. (14 miles,  1000  ft,

Big Gee (5080+ ft - 3120P - Gee Point Quad) - August 13, 2006


I sure underestimated this peak. Looking at the map, it  appeared  to  be  a
simple 2-mile ridge ramble from the end of the road. Stefan\'s TR from  June,
where he took 1.5 hours to reach  the  summit,  did  little  to  dispel  this
notion. Of course I knew it would take me longer than Stefan, but  I  didn\'t
think it would take nearly twice as long.  I wasn\'t prepared for the  amount
of annoying brush or the rugged rocky nature of the ridge with all  its  ups
and downs. And Stefan did this as a prelude to climbing Mt Lincoln.  For  me
it was the focus of the day, although I did hope to also climb a  few  other
bumps in the vicinity afterward. No luck with that.

I avoided the Seattle rush hour traffic on this Sunday, but not  the  hordes
of motorcycle riders that seem to turn out by the hundreds  (thousands?)  on
sunny weekends to travel the  North  Cascade  Highway.  They  stretched  for
miles appearing to believe that  the  roadway  is  for  their  personal  and
exclusive use and seem to delight in riding in such a tight  slow  formation
that passing is difficult to impossible. I found this as frustrating as  any
rush hour traffic and was  happy  when  I  could  turn  off  Highway  20  in
Concrete onto the Concrete-Sauk Valley Road. I then followed  Finney  Cr  Rd
17 and Rd 1705 to a saddle at 4064 ft by an open gate  where  I  parked.  Rd
1705 is in good shape, just a  little  overgrown,  but  does  have  numerous
slowing waterbars. It takes a long time to drive these roads.

Getting to the ridge was brushy and the brush  was  wet,  surprisingly.  Not
that it mattered, as the wetness felt good on this  hot  day.  Once  on  the
ridge, even though it was wooded, there was still a fair amount of brush  in
the form of small thick trees and travel was slower than expected.   I  went
over a 4600 ft bump and dropped a bit  before  climbing  the  next  4725  ft
bump, which Dalles Kloke calls Exclamation Point  (he  also  calls  Big  Gee
Whiz Peak). There was a nice view of Big  Gee  and  surrounding  peaks  from
this rocky point. Now things got interesting. There was a steep  descent  to
the next saddle, sections of narrow ridge and then a pinnacle that  required
a bypass.  I went left on slippery vegetated slabs that I did not  like.  On
the way back I went right which is much better. A final bit on  more  narrow
rocky ridge led to the high point at the NW end and another nice view  point
(1660 ft, 2:50 hrs). It took almost as long to get back (4 miles,  2330  ft,
5:20 hrs).

I had hoped to climb several more peaks in the "Gee Whiz" group  but  all  I
managed to do was drive to the tower on Leonards Ridge 3920+ ft.  I  thought
I might still be able to squeak out Finney Peak but the access  road  (1735)
was ditched lower than I expected and I just didn\'t have the  time  to  make
the summit.  I decided to return another day with a bike to follow  the  old
road, which appeared to go very near the  top.  The  peak  itself  is  quite
rocky and looked very interesting. I returned home  via  Road  18  to  Swede
Heaven Road and Highway 530 near  Darrington.  This  is  another  very  good
forest road but it takes forever to drive.

Forbidden Peak (8815 ft - 1055P - Forbidden Pk Quad) - August 17-19, 2006


There is a reason I left Forbidden Peak till  last  on  the  Bulger  Hundred
Highest  list.  I  have  known  about  this  beautiful  peak  forever,  been
intimidated by it forever and forever thought it beyond  my  reach.  I  know
these feelings are purely  psychological,  and  many  would  consider  other
peaks  I  have  already  done  to  be  harder,  but  climbing  is  often   a
psychological sport where feelings  and  perceptions  play  a  big  role  in
success. And so this is how I found myself at #99 with only Forbidden  left.
I could put it off no longer. In many ways the climb lived  up  to  both  my
expectations of a beautiful climb and my fears that it  was  too  difficult,
but it was the perfect peak for me to finish on.

Day 1: I was so paranoid about getting a permit for  Boston  Basin,  that  I
met Beth at the unnecessarily early hour of 6:00 am  near  the  intersection
of I-5 and I-405 so we could be at the Marblemount RS  not  too  long  after
they opened. I needn\'t have worried.  Only one other permit (of  6  allowed)
had been issued. With permit in hand, we took our time on  the  rough  trail
to Boston Basin arriving at the high 6200 ft camp slightly  before  2:00  pm
with plenty of leisure time to enjoy our surroundings (3.5 miles,  3000  ft,
4:10 hrs).   Neither of us had been to Boston Basin before and we were  both
blown away  with  how  gorgeous  it  was.  The  views  were  incredible,  of
Johannesburg across the valley, of Boston and Sahale,  and  of  Torment  and
Forbidden. We were also surprised with how nice the camp area was, with  all
the amenities - nearby running  water,  flat  gravel  tent  or  bivy  sites,
composting toilet (with a view to die for) and even a large boulder to  hang
food away from the marauding marmots.

We relaxed in the sun and scoped out the  route  with  binoculars.  We  both
really wanted to do the W Ridge but the normal snow couloir approach to  the
W Ridge notch looked awful. We were aware of a bypass on rock  to  the  left
up a gully, but were not sure where it was. Our second choice was to do  the
E Face ledges. We were debating what we should do, when two  Canadian  women
(the other permit holder) came down about 3:00  after  having  just  climbed
the W Ridge. They had started at 6:30 that morning and had gained the  ridge
via a gully they vaguely pointed out to  us  and  described  as  class  3-4.
Encouraged that they had done the climb so quickly, we  immediately  decided
to go their way and went to bed that night full of optimism.  As  it  turned
out this was somewhat false optimism.  It is not that they sandbagged us  so
much as we were just not in their league, not  even  close.  I  should  have
guessed.  They were tall, young,  athletic,  muscular  and  tanned  and  had
obviously climbed together often.

Day 2-3: We started at 6:45 the  next  morning.  Shortly  above  camp  in  a
higher flat basin we came across two fellows  bivied  and  not  yet  out  of
their sleeping bags. They had snuck past us  the  previous  evening.  So  we
would have company after all, we thought.  But  no.  On  talking  with  them
they were taking two days to do the  difficult  Torment-Forbidden  Traverse.
From the basin we climbed a short step and lovely gentle white  slabs  (some
cairns here) to a right trending gully  that  passed  beneath  an  extensive
cliff with several waterfalls. At the top of the cliff  more  slabs  led  to
the toe of the small unnamed glacier nestled below Forbidden\'s  S  Face.  We
donned crampons to cross a short section of broken  chaotic  ice  blocks  to
easier snow beyond, working our way to the base  of  the  snow  couloir  and
onto a rock promontory to the left  (1500  ft,  1:55  hrs).   Here  we  left
crampons and ice axes.

We could now see we had a choice of two gullies on the left  to  bypass  the
couloir. The Canadian women had said you could see rappel slings  about  100
ft up the gully they had taken,  but  this  was  not  really  that  helpful.
There are rappel slings all over the place here, in  the  couloir,  in  both
gullies and on the ribs in-between. The left most gully  looked  easiest  to
us but as we started up the  initial  slabs  we  somehow  ended  up  in  the
steeper looking blackish gully on the right.  I  am  still  not  sure  which
gully is best.  We later rappelled down the left  one  and  it  sure  didn\'t
look all that easy. But the right one we went  up  wasn\'t  easy  either.  It
definitely was not class 4. I started the lead and immediately knew  it  was
going to be harder than expected. I passed a rappel sling  and  did  several
class 5 moves until coming to a short steep chimney/cave with  an  abandoned
nut. Here I was stymied.  To  get  out  of  the  cave  required  a  slightly
overhanging off balance strenuous pull up to the left.  The  footholds  were
not good and I did not have the reach or strength in my arms to pull  myself
up and over. After almost coming off a couple times when my foot slipped,  I
brought Beth up. She is probably the better rock climber, is taller  with  a
longer reach and had rock shoes along.  I was climbing in  boots.  Even  so,
on her first try she almost came off. She then tried an  alternate  strategy
by first taking off her pack and then stemming the  chimney  more  directly.
This worked and 10 feet higher she set up a belay, brought up her  pack  and
then me on a tight rope. Whew! That was a close one  and  definitely  turned
out to be the crux of the whole climb.

Although Beth is better than me,  she  has  had  little  experience  placing
protection, so above the crux I took over the  lead  again  and  we  climbed
simultaneously. The gully was now easier,  class  3,  but  with  downsloping
slippery grass, dirt  and  slabs  and  scary  exposure,  I  placed  lots  of
protection. All this took time and by the time we reached the W Ridge  notch
it was 11:45 (2000 ft, 5 hrs).  From the notch the beautiful  W  Ridge  rose
in a perfect line to the heavens.  I could barely believe  we  had  actually
made it this far.

We began on the ridge simulclimbing. I  passed  on  the  direct  start  that
includes a big jump over a chockstone chimney, instead  electing  to  thread
between snow and rock on the N side below  the  chimney  and  regaining  the
ridge beyond. We continued directly on the crest for  several  hundred  feet
of lovely climbing.  It just doesn\'t get any better than this. The rock  was
gorgeous and solid and horns and cracks abounded for protection. At a  large
intimidating steep tower, we began belayed climbing as I bypassed it on  the
N side via exposed ledges of  moderate  difficulty  and  then  regained  the
ridge well past the tower. The remainder of the climb stayed  on  the  ridge
going over the top of the W false summit, down a short  steep  step  into  a
notch and up the final easy bit to the summit (2500 ft, 8:50 hrs).

Despite the growing lateness of the hour, we stayed long enough  on  top  to
enjoy the views, to take pictures and to  properly  congratulate  ourselves.
We could find no register, but I really didn\'t expect one, and as  often  as
the peak is climbed I saw no point in leaving one of  my  little  ones.   It
would fill up in a month. We left at 4:15, now almost certain we  would  get
down after dark. Little did we know how long after dark. (Well,  technically
we made it back to camp in daylight, but it was daylight of the next day.)

We downclimbed to the false summit then began a series of rappels along  the
ridge off established rappel anchors. I lost count of the number of  rappels
but it was somewhere around 5 or 6.  I found  many  of  the  rappels  to  be
rather awkward in keeping on the crest of the ridge. Rappels work best  down
the fall line, not along a ridge or traverse. And I was  constantly  worried
that our rope would get hung up, especially after my  recent  experience  of
losing one on Hard Mox. We only had one rope and could not  afford  to  lose
it. But we had no trouble. Beth and I worked well together getting the  rope
down, she pulling and me threading through the next anchor and  coiling.  We
regained the notch at 7:15 and downclimbed to  the  first  of  a  series  of
rappel anchors on the rib to the west of both of the bypass ascent  gullies.


These rappels (again I lost count but I think there were 5) were  easier  as
they were straight down the fall line and were exactly 50m  apart  and  went
quickly enough that we almost made it off the  rock  before  dark.   Almost.
But unexpectantly our 50m rope did not reach to the last anchor  and  I  was
left high and dry on exposed slabs very much not to my likeing about  20  ft
short in waning light. By the time we figured out a safe  way  down  it  was
pitch dark and we had to do the last (and steepest, it was down  a  vertical
cliff) rappel by headlamp. We reached the rock promontory and our  stash  of
gear at 9:45.

Our problems weren\'t over yet even though we were down the technical  stuff.
To avoid the ice on the glacier toe, we followed the snow, now  soft  enough
for boots, down as far as we could.  We did avoid the ice, but this  put  us
far W above the waterfall cliff from where we  had  bypassed  it.  We  tried
going directly down from where we were and almost made it.  Almost.  But  we
couldn\'t see well enough to find a route and ended up traversing the top  of
the cliff all the way back to our ascent gully. Once down  this,  we  picked
up the line of cairns on the slabs, now knew where we were and  almost  made
it back to camp. Almost. But we  lost  the  way  in  the  featureless  lower
terrain and completely missed it. We knew camp was at  6200  ft,  and  after
going down to 6100 ft tried climbing back to 6200  ft  and  traversing  back
and forth.  Little did we know that our altimeter was reading  high  and  we
were traversing 100 ft too low. You may well ask why I  didn\'t  just  follow
my GPS to camp as I have done on countless other trips. Well I  did  have  a
GPS with me (my low tech lightweight mapless one) but  I  had  neglected  to
mark a waypoint for camp, a major oversight and just plain dumb.  Without  a
waypoint the GPS was  useless.  And  so  we  wandered  in  the  dark  for  a
considerable length of time getting more and more confused until  it  became
obvious we didn\'t have a clue where we were or which way to go.

It was now 2am and in about 3 hrs would be light again,  so  we  decided  to
wait it out, picked a comfy level spot by a  creek,  and  plopped  ourselves
down for a little rest. I put on all my clothes, took off my boots,  put  my
feet in my pack, laid down on my short foam pad and  using  my  harness  and
rack for a lumpy pillow went to sleep.  Almost. I really didn\'t  sleep  that
much as I soon got chilled, despite the mild night.  Beth  fared  better  as
she had the foresight to have a space blanket along  and  I  think  she  did
actually sleep. I usually  take  a  3  oz  space  emergency  bag  along  but
inexplicably neglected to bring one  this  time.   Dumb,  dumb,  dumb.  That
would have really helped in keeping the light but chilling wind off.   So  I
was awake as it began getting light and I soon recognized where we were.  We
were literally only 200 yards or so from camp. What we  had  done  was  come
down W of camp, traversed 50-100 feet below it and come up to the  E  of  it
making a semicircle around it. Well we had almost found camp.  Almost!

We dragged ourselves to camp, crawled into our bags  and  had  some  quality
sleep until awakened at 8:30 by a blazing hot sun. Then I had  "dinner"  and
rehydrated and we rested more until finally packing up and leaving a  little
after noon.  On the way out, we encountered the hordes  of  climbers  coming
in for the weekend. One party of two exceptionally fit looking fellows  with
very light packs was headed for the N Ridge of Forbidden, but  most  of  the
others were after the W Ridge. We  passed  on  what  useful  information  we
could. With tired bodies moving at half speed, we reached  the  TH  at  3:00
(3.5 miles, 2:50 hrs).

Total: 10 miles and 6200 ft in 3 days

Despite our difficulties and problems, I couldn\'t ask  for  a  more  fitting
end to my  quest  to  climb  the  Bulger  Hundred  Highest  -  a  beautiful,
challenging peak, an epic adventure and my first ever  unplanned  bivy,  all
shared with a congenial compatible partner. And even though it did  take  us
a long time we got up and down safely and that is what counts. I would  also
like to thank all those generous climbers would encouraged and supported  me
throughout this quest, and who accompanied me on my other climbs.  You  know
who you are.  I couldn\'t have done it without you.

I  love  Easy  Pass.  It  has  a  pleasant  short  trail  that  leads  to  a
spectacularly scenic area. With the added incentive of several worthy  peaks
to climb on either side of the pass, it seemed perfect for a laid back  two-
day trip. The only caveat was it was too late in the season for water to  be
available at the pass itself so I had to haul it  from  the  last  available
source about 1500 ft below. This added a noticeable  7  pounds  to  my  pack
weight but was total worth it to be able to camp at  the  pass.  I  found  a
wonderful campsite several hundred yards away from  the  trail  and  on  the
National Forest side of the ridge so as to be legal without  a  Park  permit
(3.5 miles, 2:45 hrs, 2850 ft).

Graybeard Pk: I quickly set up camp and started for Graybeard at  2:50.  You
cannot see Graybeard from Easy Pass and must first get around a 7360  ft  NW
cliffy point. This I did by climbing the ridge SE to about 6800 ft and  then
traversing and dropping into a western basin. This basin contained  a  small
tarn and creek and would make a nice place to camp (this is in the  National
Park though and requires a permit). From the lower end of a basin I  spotted
a ramp that appeared to go around a cliff to give simple  access  to  the  W
Ridge, but instead led to 200 ft of sporting  class  4  climbing  with  good
holds. Once above this the ridge leveled off at  a  7200  ft  saddle  before
rising again where I worked my way up class 2-3 terrain along the  crest.  I
soon came to the "25 ft notch that requires climbing" mentioned  in  Beckey.
Not knowing exactly what this meant I had come prepared with an 80  ft  rope
and very light rack but the notch ended up being only a 10 ft class  4  step
with good holds that did not require any of the above. I topped out  on  the
summit at 5:05 (1650 ft, 2:15). I could find no register  and  left  one  of
mine.

When I had left in the morning the forecast was for  10  percent  chance  of
rain during the day and  zero  percent  at  night.  Despite  this,  I  could
clearly see weather headed  my  way  as  fog  began  enveloping  the  higher
summits and a few raindrops began falling. Where  the  heck  did  this  come
from? I had planned on climbing Little Tack (7400 ft - 160P) just to the  S,
and to this end quickly descended southern scree slopes to a  broad  saddle.
I then climbed up to a cute point just N of the spire (which  I  have  taken
the liberty of naming Tiny Tack) but Little  Tack  looked  to  be  a  fairly
serious undertaking, at least one or maybe two roped pitches  and  with  the
deteriorating weather it didn\'t seem advisable  to  continue.  So  I  headed
back to the 7200 ft saddle in the W Ridge and an  easier  descent  into  the
basin than the way I had come up and hastened back to camp arriving at  7:15
(3 miles, 2050 ft, 4:25 hrs RT). It was now raining lightly  and  everything
was all wet. With me in my confining bivy tent, changing clothes and  making
a  hot  dinner  was  a  challenge  requiring  all  manner  of  uncomfortable
contortions.  It rained lightly but steadily for a good two hours.  I  guess
zero percent chance of rain doesn\'t mean it can\'t rain!

Kitling Pk: I started for Kitling the next morning under clearing  skies  at
7:15 climbing directly N from Easy Pass to the crest  of  the  ridge  above.
This is the start of the aptly  named  Ragged  Ridge  and  it  certainly  is
ragged. I climbed to a 7280 highpoint, then  had  to  descend  and  traverse
unpleasant scree and hard dirt around the cliffs of Pt 7690 (210P)  until  I
could ascend to the top of this point from  the  SW.  I  then  followed  the
ridge to the saddle with Kitling, ascending that peak via  class  3  gullies
on the SW slope. I reached the summit at 10:00 (1950 ft, 2:45 hrs). I  found
a film can register placed June 15, 1996  by  Dallas  Kloke.  There  were  5
other entries including Stefan Feller and Greg Koenig on  9/16/05  and  Mike
Torok on 10/10/05. I transcribed the entries into one  of  my  registers  as
best I could (they were a little hard to read)  and  included  the  original
piece of paper.

Cub Pk: I now headed for this peak descending my ascent route until I  could
traverse W below cliffs to a 7440 ft saddle (Mesahchie Col). From  here  the
ridge looked harder than it turned out to be.  I still carried my  rope  and
rack but I didn\'t need them (in fact I didn\'t use them the whole  trip,  but
it was comforting to know I could if necessary).   Cub  may  not  have  much
prominence but it is a named peak and turned out  to  be  a  very  enjoyable
mostly class 3, with a few class 4 moves, climb  by  staying  right  on  the
crest. It also has a most  spectacular  head-on  view  of  the  W  ridge  of
Mesahchie. I topped out at 11:50 (2500 ft, 4:35 hrs) and found the  original
first ascent register placed on August 24, 1968 by  John  and  Chris  Roper.
The two scraps of paper were in surprisingly good shape considering the  old
metal film can was corroded through in several spots. It was  still  legible
because John had signed in with a  permanent  black  marker.   He  stated  "
named Cub Pk because it\'s the smaller companion to Panther Pk 8795  directly
to the west". Panther Pk was John\'s original name for Mesahchie Pk.  I  love
the sense of history these old registers provide. There were 7 more  entries
including Grant Meyers 7/10/91, Mitch Blanton 5/23/92  and  Don  and  Natala
Goodman 9/25/93, the last being in 2002. I  only  had  a  matchbox  register
left with me, which was too small to include the original paper.  So  I  put
that in the intact plastic film can I had removed  from  Kitling  to  better
protect it and placed both it and the new matchbox in the summit cairn.

From Mesahchie Col I dropped  directly  SE  down  scree  to  begin  a  lower
traverse than on the way in at 7200 ft back to the  ridge  above  Easy  Pass
from where I hoped to climb New Morning Pk.  Beckey describes  the  W  Ridge
of this peak as "a hike".  He has got to be kidding! He obviously has  never
climbed this peak or even looked at it. This is the  impressive  rocky  peak
that looms to the N directly above the last 1000 ft of the Easy Pass  Trail.
Not only is the W ridge not a hike, I am not sure  it  can  be  climbed,  at
least not very easily.  I scrambled along the ridge  as  far  as  reasonably
possible until stopped by notches and sheer pinnacles. I was quickly  losing
my desire to continue until I spotted a route by descending a  hundred  feet
or so and traversing on awful scree ledges to get past the  pinnacles  until
an even worse awful loose gully allowed a way up to the ridge and summit  at
2:35. I did make the top but as a  climb  it  has  little  to  recommend  it
except a lovely name.  At least it was mercifully short. No  register  other
than a rusted can with some sort of banner crammed inside.

I was back to camp by 3:30 (4 miles, 3100 ft, 8:15  hrs),  left  45  minutes
later and at the car at 5:30.

Total: 14 miles and 8000 ft in 2 days

Mt Steel Quad - September 8-11, 2006

It has been over two years since I have been to the Olympics (been too  busy
chasing after Big Boys, none of  which  reside  there)  and  I  have  sorely
missed them.  I love the Olympics. So  when  a  trip  to  climb  Fisher  and
Arriva was cancelled due to impending bad  weather  and  other  problems,  I
figured it was time to rectify the situation. I had always wanted  to  visit
the high mountain lakes of  LaCrosse,  Hart  and  Marmot,  whose  beauty  is
legendary, but they are so far in that I just never got around to it. I  had
four days available to me, Friday  to  Monday  with  rain  predicted  Friday
night and Saturday. A little rain would not be a big problem for the  mostly
trail approach and for viewing the lakes.  And if  the  weather  turned  out
better than expected, there were several worthwhile peaks  in  the  vicinity
to climb.

Day 1: I began the long approach up  the  East  Fork  Quinault  River  Trail
(elev 600 ft) at 10:15. I  had  a  minor  setback  when  I  discovered  that
permits are no longer issued at the TH  (they  were  the  last  time  I  was
there) but must be obtained at a ranger station. I was considering  being  a
scofflaw rather than drive all the way  back  to  Quinault,  when  a  Ranger
drove up and I talked him,  after  some  resistance,  into  issuing  me  one
personally. I politely suggested that a prominent  sign  be  posted  at  the
start of the road to the effect that permits must be obtained at the  ranger
station. He said there was a sign.  Perhaps, but it was not  obvious  enough
for me to notice it.

I carried my climbing boots and  hiked  the  13.3  miles  to  the  Enchanted
Valley in light trail shoes to save my feet, changing to  boots  only  after
the trail became rougher and started climbing  steeply  above  the  river  a
couple miles farther on. At 16.9 miles (elev 3200 ft) I turned off onto  the
O\'Neil Pass Trail. It was now 6:45 and  I  knew  I  couldn\'t  get  too  much
farther before dark.  I had hoped to camp at the edge of  White  Cr  Meadow,
elev 3750, about another mile, but both  established  campsites  there  were
occupied, so I continued off trail another 200 ft into the  basin  of  White
Cr and found an adequate flat spot between boulders at 7:45 (18 miles,  4600
ft, 9:30 hrs) with just enough light left to set  up  camp.  Dinner  was  by
headlamp.

Day 2 - White Mtn: The entire day Friday had remained  sunny  and  warm  but
sometime  during  the  night  weather  moved  in  and  it  rained  steadily,
occasionally even hard, until daylight. Then it quit. Must have been a  fast
moving cold  front.  But  everything  was  wet  and  lingering  fog  limited
visibility.  Still, I thought I could climb White Mtn from where I was.   It
was a straight shot some 2400 ft above me.  All  I  had  to  do  was  follow
White Cr. This  route  is  not  even  mentioned  in  the  Olympic  Mountains
Climbing Guide, but it has to be the easiest way up.

Despite the fog, the route up meadows was pleasant and easy  going  until  I
reached the upper cliffy area and even  then  it  was  not  bad  by  Olympic
standards. My GPS guided me in the general direction of the top through  the
cliffs to a notch and a final class 3-4 scramble (1 mile, 2400 ft,  2  hrs).
The guide calls it class 2, but then it  always  underestimates  difficulty,
although I probably didn\'t find the easiest way. The fog  was  beginning  to
lift and views were slowly appearing. There are three points that appear  on
the map with the same number of contours.  I was  on  the  north  summit.  I
could see the two southern points well enough  to  sight  on  them  with  my
clinometer and both read enough lower that I was  convinced  my  summit  was
the high point. There was also a cairn (no register  but  I  left  one)  and
that is where the name is located on the map. Good enough for me.

I was back in camp by 12:30 and packed by 1:30. Meanwhile I  had  formulated
a plan to continue crosscountry  to  Lake  LaCrosse  rather  than  take  the
trail. Robert Wood in his Trail Guide to the Olympic  Mountains  mentions  a
route over Fishers Notch that could  be  done  by  experienced  backpackers.
Unfortunately, I had descended into fog again and couldn\'t  see  the  route.
Still, there had to be one, although it looked awfully  steep  on  the  map,
and I thought if I just headed in the general direction I  would  figure  it
out. It actually turned out to be a nice way to go,  although  a  bit  of  a
grunt with a full pack on the loose rock. I pulled over the  5400  ft  notch
at 3:15 and entered heaven on the other side.

I descended lovely meadows, picked up the trail at  Lake  LaCrosse,  took  a
side trip to Hart Lake, went past  Marmot  Lake  and  a  junction  with  the
Duckabush River Trail and wandered up and down to a delightful  campsite  by
a small mossy babbling brook just below O\'Neil  Pass.  This  whole  area  is
every bit as beautiful as its reputation would have you  believe.  Even  the
billowing fog did not detract but  only  added  a  bit  of  mystery  to  the
landscape. I also had it all to myself, seeing no one else anywhere.  I  set
up camp at 6:15 with enough time to  relax  and  watch  Mt  Anderson  slowly
emerge from the clouds in the distance (5 miles,  2400  ft,  4:45  hrs  from
White Cr camp).

Day 3 - Mt Duckabush and Overlook Pk: Morning dawned cold and  clear  and  I
started for Mt Duckabush at 7:50. I traversed from camp and  found  a  steep
ramp to descend into the snow basin N of  the  mountain.  Mt  Duckabush  has
three summits, East, Middle and West. The East Pk is surveyed  at  6233  ft,
is where the name is printed on the map and is what I would  presume  to  be
the high point. According to map contours the Middle Pk is 6160+ ft and  the
West Pk 6200+ ft.  Yet for some strange reason  the  Climber\'s  Guide  lists
the West Pk as 6250 ft and considers it to be  the  summit.  Perhaps  giving
this peak a higher  elevation  is  wishful  thinking  as  it  is  much  more
imposing and difficult to attain. I have found the  Climber\'s  Guide  to  be
inconsistent and puzzling with many anomalies  when  it  comes  to  relating
names to high points.  This however left me in a quandary as to  which  peak
to climb. The logical solution, of course, was to climb  both.  However  the
East Pk was listed as class 3 and the West Pk as class 4. Since I have  also
found the guide listings to be consistently underrated (always  increase  it
by one class) I was not sure I had the skills, time or gear (I only  had  an
80 ft rope and 2 slings) to climb their class 4.

All these considerations aside, I wasn\'t  sure  I  could  even  get  up  the
easier East Pk.  The standard route up  the  snowfinger  and  gully  to  the
notch between East and Middle Peaks looked awful and my heart  sank  when  I
discovered the snow was frozen to ice hard. To save weight on the long  trek
in I had brought aluminum half-crampons with 6 points that only covered  the
front half of my boots. Would I be able to climb the steepening finger  with
these? To my surprise  they  worked  better  than  expected  as  long  as  I
concentrated on keeping my weight on the front  of  my  boots,  but  it  was
still a nervewracking tiptoeing cotton-mouthed business.  The  point  of  my
aluminum axe did not penetrate the snow enough to do any good  but  I  found
that by swinging full force the pick went  in  about  an  inch  and  gave  a
surprisingly solid handhold. In this manner I was able to get to the end  of
the snow and enter the gully, where things did not improve that much.   Even
by Olympic standards (renowned for loose crud) this gully was awful. I  kept
my crampons on (much to their detriment) mainly because I couldn\'t  keep  my
balance long enough to remove them but also  because  they  actually  helped
give me purchase on the steep dirt.  Even so  I  was  barely  able  to  make
upward progress and  often  slipped  backwards  in  the  shifting  junk.  As
gullies go, this has to rank as one of my worst ever.  (Note  that  if  this
gully were filled with reasonably soft snow all the  way  to  the  notch  it
would be an easy romp.)

I thankfully topped out at the 6000 ft notch at 10:10 and  the  East  Pk  20
minutes later (1500 ft, 2:40 hrs). There was a cairn but no register. I  did
leave one of mine. I spent a half hour on top enjoying all the views  I  had
missed the previous day. But what to do now? I was not keen  on  going  back
down the gully and snowfinger, which was in the shade and would  not  soften
significantly all day. There was supposed to be a class 3 route all on  rock
directly down the NW arÃªte from the West Peak. The Middle  (you  had  to  go
over the Middle Pk to get to the West  Pk)  and  West  Peaks  looked  rather
challenging but doable if the rock wasn\'t too bad. Maybe I could do  a  loop
and avoid the gully entirely.  And so I chose the evil I  didn\'t  know  over
the evil I did know. Not always a wise thing to do.

I actually found the climb over the Middle Pk to  the  West  Pk  reasonable,
and dare I say it, enjoyable. It really was mostly class 4 with maybe a  few
very low class 5 moves.  The holds were good although some were loose.   But
the traverse, which stayed for the most part right on the ridge  crest,  was
very exposed.  So I took my time, tested each hold and arrived at  the  West
Summit at 12:05 (1800 ft, 4:15 hrs). I had sighted from East to West Pk  and
now I sighted  West  to  East  Pk  with  my  clinometer.   According  to  my
measurements the East 6233 ft Pk is definitely higher. No matter. I found  a
register on the West Pk so "those  in  the  know"  must  consider  this  the
summit. The register was placed 8/4/86 and there were only 4 other  entries.


About now I was feeling pretty good and  looking  forward  to  a  relatively
easy class 3 descent down the arÃªte.  Almost  immediately  that  expectation
was shattered as I came to a steep wall just  below  the  summit.  Class  3?
Where oh where is there a class 3 route down this wall?  Or even a  class  4
one. Search as I did I could find none. The thought of reversing  everything
back to the notch and gully was almost  unthinkable  at  this  point.  So  I
found a very circuitous way to do an end run on the S  slopes  to  get  past
the wall and crossed over the W ridge back to the NW  arÃªte.  Much  of  this
was on awful loose ledges and the farther I descended the more I felt I  was
sealing my fate and fast reaching the point of no return. Once on the  arÃªte
I looked up at the wall and still could see no way up  it.  I  was  able  to
downclimb the arÃªte for a couple hundred feet  until  I  hit  another  step.
Class 3? You have got to be kidding! I should have known better. I got  down
this section with 3 rappels using my woefully short 80 ft  rope.   Two  were
off trees and one off a rock horn.  While pulling the rope off the  horn,  a
rock came down and smashed my right index finger. Better my finger  than  my
head. Eventually the terrain on the left moderated enough that  I  left  the
arÃªte for sandy ledges and slabs and worked my way down to a snow slope  (in
the sun and soft enough for boots) above an ice lake. This whole descent  of
little more than 600 ft took over 2 hours.

From the ice lake I wandered gentle terrain  back  to  O\'Neil  Pass.  I  had
thought to climb O\'Neil Pk but I was running out of time and  energy  and  I
decided not to press my luck any farther. I felt fortunate to  have  escaped
Duckabush intact. I did however  have  time  to  zip  up  easy  Overlook  Pk
directly above the pass. Despite being slowed by luscious blueberries I  was
on that summit in 30  minutes.  This  peak  is  aptly  named,  as  it  is  a
wonderful viewpoint. I found an illegible register in a  jar  half  full  of
water on top. I was back in camp by 5:00 (3 miles, 2800 ft, 9  hrs  for  the
day).

Day 4: I was awakened to the wonderful wilderness sound of an  elk  bugling.
I poked my nose out my tent and sure enough a bull  was  jealously  guarding
his harem in the basin directly below. It was getting that time of  year.  I
began the long trip out at 8:30 staying on trail the whole way.  The  entire
O\'Neil Pass trail is a delight as it traverses up and  down  through  scenic
meadows. I began running into people coming in. I had seen  no  one  at  all
the whole time I was in the Lakes Basin. Just after crossing  White  Cr  and
turning a corner in the trail I startled a bear not 10 feet away. It  was  a
tossup who  was  more  frightened,  he  or  I.  I  heard  more  elk  bugling
throughout the day but saw no more. I reached the junction  with  the  trail
to Anderson Pass at 12:15 and the Enchanted Valley at 2:00.  I  stopped  for
lunch by the river, soaked my aching feet and changed from  boots  to  light
shoes for the rest of the trip out. I wasn\'t sure I could  make  it  out  in
one day, but it wasn\'t as bad as I had thought and my body and feet held  up
reasonably well. I reached the TH at 8:00 just at dark  without  needing  to
use my headlamp (24 miles, 1900 ft, 11:30 hrs).

Grand Total: 52 miles and 14,100 ft in 4 days

I have had my eye on Mt Olsen for a number of years. It is not  a  difficult
peak, just a long ways in, as many Olympic peaks are. I  originally  thought
to access it from the N Fork Skokomish and long steep Six Ridge  Trail,  but
the closure of Staircase due to fire damage to the road made me look for  an
alternative. So that is how I ended up going in over Wynoochee Pass. I  have
long been intrigued by  this  trail,  but  it  had  a  reputation  of  being
difficult to find  and  difficult  to  follow  and  was  reported  to  being
essentially abandoned. Thus, before trying to use this trail  for  access  I
decided to scout it out on a 2-day trip beforehand.  Good thing I did, as  I
got royally lost trying to find  the  trailhead  in  the  maze  of  unmarked
logging roads beyond Wynoochee Lake.  But I also discovered that  the  trail
is far from abandoned and is in fact completely logged and  brushed  out.  I
got as far  as  McGravey  Lakes  on  my  reconnaissance,  became  completely
enchanted with the area, couldn\'t wait to return and even climbed  the  high
point of Six Ridge (5122 ft - 762P).

Day 1: Even with previous knowledge of how to get to the TH, it  still  took
forever to drive the nearly 50 miles of logging roads N from  Montesano  and
it was almost 11:00  before  Linda  and  I  left  the  car,  elev  2500  ft.
Surprisingly there was one other car  parked.  The  road  is  blocked  by  a
washout  .3 mile before the true TH.  Walking the road,  we  soon  ran  into
the owner of the parked vehicle coming out.  He  was  a  volunteer  for  the
Park and had a permanent camp at the crossing of  the  Wynoochee  R  some  2
miles in. (I had noticed this tent on my prior trip and wondered about  it.)
 He told us that volunteers had been working on the trail  for  the  past  6
years and had finally completed the work. What good timing for  us!  He  was
coming back in a few days to dismantle his camp  before  the  seasonal  road
closure Oct 1.

At the switchback in the road,  the  true  trail  (unmarked)  went  straight
ahead and immediately entered lovely mossy woods, in sharp contrast  to  the
miles of clearcuts before. In another .3  miles,  the  boundary  of  Olympic
National  Park  was  reached  where  permits  were  available.   The   trail
continued, in good shape but rough in spots and obviously not heavily  used,
2.4 miles to the small meadow at Wynoochee Pass,  elev  3600  ft  (1250  ft,
1:40 hr). From here the trail drops 900 ft in 1.4 miles to a  junction  with
the Graves Cr Trail, only to climb back up again.  Over the years, to  avoid
this ridiculous unnecessary elevation loss, hikers have booted in  a  cutoff
trail that more or less contours from one trail branch to the other.  It  is
rough and brushy but well marked with flags and easily followed.  It  begins
about .3 mile down from the pass.

Once back on the main trail, we passed the junction with  the  Sundown  Pass
and S Fork Skokomish Trail at a meadow where we  startled  a  bear  cub  (no
mama in sight), then continued on to Sundown Lake  where  an  elk  herd  was
foraging the slopes above. From here the trail climbed to  Six  Ridge  Pass,
elev 4700 ft, only to drop steeply to McGravey Lakes, elev 4000 ft where  we
saw another bear. Another 2 miles of up and down took  us  to  Belview,  the
site of a shelter now gone, and a final uphill mile met the junction of  the
trail to Lake Success on the crest of the Ridge, elev 4400 (10  miles,  4300
ft, 7:20 hrs). Even though this section of trail went exasperatingly up  and
down, it traversed delightful terrain full of  meadows,  creeks,  tarns  and
views.

We really wanted to make Lake Success for camp, but it was getting late,  it
was still 3 miles away and we were worried we wouldn\'t make it before  dark.
Fortunately, the Lake Success Trail, actually part of the old  abandoned  Mt
Olsen Trail that used to go all the way to the Enchanted Valley  Trail,  was
in much better shape than expected. It began by more or less  following  the
crest of Six Ridge to a saddle (elev 4900 ft) between two towers (Shaw  5065
ft & Heather 5025 ft), dropped 600 ft into the basin beyond, climbed  up  to
a spur ridge, crossed, dropped on the other side, climbed again to the  spur
ridge before making a final drop to the beautiful meadows of  Success  Basin
where we saw another bear. Yikes, this one was  too  close  for  comfort  to
where we would be camping. We found a wonderful spot for our tent above  the
lake at 7:30, elev 4200 ft (13 miles, 5300 ft,  8:30  hours.  Note  that  we
ended up only 1700 ft above the elevation of the car but had  to  gain  5300
ft on the up and down route to get there.

Day 2: Mt Olsen is not far from Lake Success, so we were in no great  hurry,
starting at 9:40. We began on the old Mt Olsen Trail, but this trail is  now
very sketchy and we soon lost it in the initial steep brushy  hillside.   We
picked it up again at the edge of a high meadow, where we saw bear # 4,  but
soon lost it again. The trail actually stays in the woods to  the  right  of
the meadow climbing nearly to the saddle NE of Pt 4935 before  crossing  the
meadow high and traversing to the saddle E of Mt Olsen.  We  could  see  the
trail switchbacking down into the basin on the other side  but  I  doubt  it
can be followed very far anymore before disappearing  completely  in  brush.
From the saddle, Mt Olsen is an easy climb up steep heather and  blueberries
and we reached the summit at 11:30 (1150 ft, 1:50 hr).

Views were spectacular and we spent a good half hour  enjoying  them  before
attempting the traverse to the West Peak. I wasn\'t sure this peak  would  go
very easily.  Looking at the map, the connecting ridge  looked  narrow  with
steep contours on either side, often a sign of  rocky  pinnacles  and  other
obstacles. Even getting down to the saddle between  the  two  peaks  was  no
picnic and harder than it looked mostly because views to  the  W  Peak  were
obstructed and it was not obvious how to get on the ridge. Then once at  the
saddle, some four notches had to be crossed. The first two  were  easy;  the
third had a 50 wall that was surmounted directly  by  pulling  on  branches.
But the last notch was a shocker.  Just when I  thought  I  had  the  summit
made I came to a deep seemingly impassible 100 ft  notch.   I  couldn\'t  see
any way down directly so backtracked to descend  an  awful  side  gully  and
traversed questionable dirt and rock ledges  until  I  could  get  into  the
notch from below. A final easy scramble led to the summit at 1:20 (1900  ft,
3:40 hrs).

On the way back I was able to ascend out of the notch directly  as  I  could
see where to go. Branch belays helped. It was also easier to  climb  up  the
ridge to Mt Olsen. I was back on that summit at 2:40 and we were  both  back
to camp at 4:20 after seeing bear #5 (3.5 miles, 2900 ft, 6:40) I  rested  a
bit then took off for  Peak  5050.  Linda  elected  to  stay  in  camp.  The
approach to this peak was delightful through meadows to an upper  tarn  just
below the ridgeline.  Here I saw a lone bull elk with  a  very  large  rack.
My, what a handsome fellow he was. The rest of the way to the summit was  up
easy heather and blueberries, a short pleasant climb. I ambled back to  camp
through more meadows and saw yet another bear (1.5 miles, 850  ft,  1:30  hr
RT). While I was gone Linda discovered a full set of elk antlers.

Day 3: With all the ups and downs and rest stops it actually took us  longer
to hike out than in. We took a side trip up Heather  Pt  for  the  fantastic
view of where we had been.  We had a long rest at Belview and  stopped  even
longer at McGravey Lakes where I soaked my feet and Linda took a very  quick
dip in the cold water. We saw  our  last  bear  (#7)  in  the  meadows  near
Sundown Pass junction.  This is the same place we saw the  cub  on  the  way
in, but this bear was BIG.  Maybe it was mama bear. Despite  all  the  bears
we saw, none gave us a bit of trouble and ran away as soon as they  saw  us.
We continued our leisurely pace and reached the car at 6:45 (13 miles,  3750
ft, 10 hrs).

Total: 31 miles and 12,800 ft in 3 days

Discovery Pk (4837 ft - 637P) & West Discovery Pk (4665 ft - 425P) - Mt
Hoquiam Quad - September 27, 2006

I ran across these peaks while researching the Wynoochee  Pass  approach  to
Mt Olsen and what a pleasant surprise they turned out to be  -  little  gems
hidden in a maze of logging roads and clearcuts. Both are on the ridge  that
forms the boundary of the Olympic National Park in  this  area  but  neither
has been logged to the summit. Yes the approach is on an  old  logging  road
(about 1 mile long), but a nice little fisherman\'s  trail  (about  .5  mile)
leads from the end of the road to Discovery Lake and  lovely  meadows.  From
the lake it is a fun little scramble to the rocky summits of both peaks.

A bonus is the rock spires of Grosbeak (4400+  ft)  peaking  out  above  the
forest on the S ridge of the W Peak in a most  unexpected  location.   These
unique looking spires are visible from where the car is parked but there  is
no indication of them on the map. I spent a couple hours  climbing  the  two
highest ones. The N spire is easily climbed via the class 3  but  exposed  N
ridge. The S spire can probably be climbed from the notch  with  the  N  one
but looked to be class 5 and I had  no  gear  with  me  so  didn\'t  try  it.
Instead I found a class 4 route from the notch with a lesser spire on the  S
and up the S ridge. There are many other  climbing  possibilities  on  these
fun spires if you come prepared.

I had good views into the heart of the Olympics and to  the  near  peaks  of
Capitol, Church, Three Peaks and Hoquiam, all  of  which  looked  rocky  and
inviting. They are all now on my to do list but I will have  to  wait  until
next year as the seasonal road closure begins October  1  and  will  prevent
access unless you are willing to have  a  long  bike  ride  with  a  lot  of
elevation gain. This area has opened up many  new  possibilities  for  short
but quality climbs for me. The  only  caveat  is  the  long  drive  and  the
possibility of getting lost on the miles of unmarked logging  roads  in  the
Wynoochee lake area.

Total: 6.5 miles, 2700 ft and 7 hrs.

Quad - September 29 - October 1, 2006

After seeing Mt LaCrosse from White Mtn a few  weeks  ago,  I  was  keen  to
climb this peak. It looked so inviting. And, of course, while  in  the  area
it made sense to go after Mt Elk Lick also  as  both  can  be  climbed  from
LaCrosse Pass. Before the washout and closure of the Dosewallips River  Road
some 4 miles before the TH, the shortest approach would  have  been  up  the
West Fork Dosewallips River Trail. It still  may  be  the  shortest,  but  I
decided to go in via the Duckabush River Trail  instead,  despite  its  many
ups and downs, as I had never been up that trail.

Day 1: I left the TH (elev 440 ft) at  10:20  under  sunny  skies  and  warm
temperatures. The trail was in excellent shape (I hiked the  entire  day  in
light trail shoes carrying my boots), first climbing on an old road  to  The
Brothers Wilderness Boundary at  1  mile,  elev  900  ft,  at  Little  Hump,
dropping about 300 ft to the river and then  climbing  in  many  switchbacks
steeply to Big Hump, elev 1700 ft (4 miles, 1770 ft, 2:20 hrs). Big Hump  is
an annoyance to hikers, but it was also  a  barrier  to  early  loggers  and
spared the upper Duckabush old growth forest from their  saws.  It  is  also
somewhat of a geologic curiosity as I found out when I decided to  climb  to
the high point of Big Hump (1817 ft - 57P - Mt Jupiter Quad).  It looked  so
easy on the map and I thought it would be a  fun  little  10  minutes  round
trip to a scenic viewpoint. Well, Big Hump is actually a cluster of  several
little steep rocky mossy "humps" each surrounded by a 50-75 ft  deep  "moat"
that make finding the highest hump and travel between  humps  difficult.  It
was interesting and I did get my viewpoint on top  the  highest  hump  (with
the help of my GPS) but the RT took 35 minutes and was rather  more  than  I
bargained for.

From Big Hump the trail dropped again some 600 ft to the scenic  river  full
of pools and rapids and narrow canyons.  The  trail  wandered  up  and  down
through lovely mossy old growth forest and campsites were numerous.  At  6.5
miles was the boundary of Olympic National Park and at 10.6 miles the  large
established (and smelly) stock camp of Tenmile, elev 1500 ft (2700 ft,  6:15
hr).

I would have liked to camp at LaCrosse Pass, but knew that I could  not  get
that far (20.1 miles) this time  of  year.  The  days  are  too  short  now.
Instead, I hoped to get to the junction with the LaCrosse Pass  Trail  (15.9
miles). But even that was beginning to look like a stretch unless  I  wanted
to set up camp in the dark.  So when I came  upon  an  inviting  established
site just opposite where Crazy Cr joins the Duckabush  at  5:50  (elev  1900
ft), I decided to go no farther (13.5 miles, 3400 ft, 7:30 hrs). I was  able
to wash up in the river, set  up  camp  and  eat  dinner  all  before  dark.
Actually this camp worked out for the best.   From  near  here  there  is  a
route directly upslope to Elk Lick. If I could come down that  way  I  would
save myself miles and hours by not returning to LaCrosse Pass.

Day 2: Knowing this would be a very long day, I  got  going  as  soon  as  I
could drag myself from the comfort of a warm sleeping bag and  was  underway
at 6:45. I used my  headlamp  for  the  first  20  minutes.  I  reached  the
LaCrosse Pass Trail, elev 2680 ft, at 8:00. I left this  trail  at  5200  ft
and climbed meadows directly to the ridge above, following the  crest  W  to
the base of the false summit. Here I  attacked  the  false  summit  head  on
getting into slightly tricky class 3-4 terrain.  It would have  been  easier
to contour around.  From the saddle with the main summit, I traversed  below
cliffs to a diagonal cleft that gave  access  to  steep  heather  and  scree
slopes on the S slope. I topped out at 11:30 (4800  ft,  4:45  hrs).  In  an
interesting note, the survey marker on the  summit  was  engraved  with  the
elevation 6410 ft. Since all the guides  list  the  elevation  as  6417  ft,
either the books are wrong, the marker is wrong or the marker is not on  the
high point. I have no idea  which  but  I  placed  my  register  on  a  bump
slightly E of the marker. It appeared slightly higher to  me  but  mostly  I
put it there because I could build a better cairn there to house it.

Views were spectacular (I spent 45 minutes on top), even though  marine  air
was forming and fingers of fog were beginning  to  work  their  way  up  the
river valleys below me. Rain was predicted for the night and  following  day
and it appeared to be on its way.  I just hoped it would hold off  a  while.
I returned to the saddle but from  that  point  traversed  below  the  false
summit and entire ridge all the way back to the trail. I followed the  trail
a very short distance before leaving it again at 1:25,  elev  5300  ft,  and
beginning a long traverse E toward Elk Lick.

The traverse began easily enough, through colorful  meadows  following  game
trails staying at about 5400 ft until coming to a spur ridge S of  Pt  6206.
Here I was forced to climb another couple hundred feet before finding a  way
to drop into the basin beyond. I continued dropping to 5100 ft  until  below
cliffs, then climbed again toward a  distinctive  looking  gendarme  that  I
thought was on the  summit  ridge.   No  such  luck.   As  I  got  closer  I
discovered I had another rocky rib to cross, another basin to drop into  and
the summit was still a long  ways  off.  Goldman  in  her  75  Scrambles  in
Washington states that "the trip to Elk Lick takes  about  7  hours  and  is
much longer than it appears". She got that right, although presumably the  7
hours is RT from LaCrosse Pass, not one way.

Once in the final basin below the summit, I could see no simple way  to  the
top. As I climbed upward, though, two gullies appeared feasible.  The  right
one was more direct but the upper part was obscured by a  chockstone/boulder
and I couldn\'t tell if it went all the way up. The left one  looked  easier,
at least to start.  I chose the left one and discovered it wasn\'t that  easy
soon encountering class 3-4 terrain and very steep  loose  dirt  and  scree.
Near the top I also  ran  into  dense  annoying  scrub  trees  that  impeded
progress. I reached the broad flat summit  at  4:20  (7000  ft,  9:35  hrs).
There was a register but the top was off and the bottom missing so  you  can
guess the condition of any contents. I remedied the situation  by  replacing
it with one of mine.

The fog obscured some of the views but the weather  was  still  holding.  It
was getting late with no time to spare and I quickly  left  for  my  planned
route straight down to camp. I decided to descend the  right  gully,  rather
than the left one I had ascended, as it appeared to be a direct  shot  down.
It was until I reached a rock step just above the  chockstone/boulder.  Here
I fiddled around trying to find a way to downclimb, tossed my poles down  to
get them out of my way, ended up rappelling another way then had  to  search
around to find my poles again all this wasting precious time. By the time  I
got off the rock it was 5:30 with little daylight left.
I began by making good time down meadows and scree following  to  the  right
of the cliffs of the S ridge of Elk Lick. Once below the cliffs I  tried  to
traverse left toward the supposed line of the uphill  route  from  Crazy  Cr
but it soon became obvious this was not feasible  as  there  were  too  many
brushy ravines to cross.  Note that the Crazy Cr route climbs  the  SE  side
of Elk Lick and may not even connect (at least not easily) with the SW  side
route I had just done. So I resigned myself to dropping down the  fall  line
into uncharted territory. I tried to stay on timbered ribs,  but  twice  the
ribs ended and funneled me into ugly ravines clogged  with  brush.  Crossing
the particularly nasty second ravine, I placed my pole  on  what  I  thought
was solid ground to get down to the creek at the bottom, watched it go  into
space up to the handle and me follow it head over  heel.  As  I  lay  upside
down completely devoured by the brush hole two thoughts  came  to  me:  one,
that I bet no other human being had ever been in this  exact  place  before;
and two, that should I meet my demise here I would never ever be found.

Once across that ravine, I was able to stay on a  timbered  rib  with  light
brush the rest of the way and I stumbled across  the  trail  at  7:25  (elev
2400 ft) not having needed my headlamp. I had, however,  missed  camp  by  a
mile, literally. I hobbled the last mile back along the  trail  to  camp  by
headlamp in 30 minutes (15 miles, 7150 ft, 13:10 hrs).

Day 3: I slept in till 7:30 and  left  at  9:15.  The  expected  rain  never
materialized and I awoke to sunshine and blue skies. Was  I  really  in  the
"rainy" Olympics? The trip out was  uneventful  and  leisurely.  Long  river
bottom trails are not really my favorite thing, but I embraced this one  and
took time to enjoy the beautiful forest and river. I met  one  other  camper
at TenMile, then a few Sunday day hikers once past the uphill grind  to  Big
Hump. Not having learned my lesson on Big Hump, I climbed to the high  point
of Little Hump (997 ft - 77P - Mt Jupiter Quad). It  was  a  repeat  of  Big
Hump with similar geology but, appropriately, the "humps" were on a  smaller
scale.  The RT from the trail took 35 minutes.  I  pulled  into  the  TH  at
4:30 (13.5 miles, 1750 ft, 7:15 hrs).

Total: 42 miles and 12,300 ft in 3 days

Mt Lena, East Pk (5800+ ft - 640P - The Brothers Quad) & The Bandersnatch
(5480+ ft - Mt Skokomish Quad) - October 4-6, 2006

My plan was to do the Scout Lake Way Trail between Upper Lena Lake  and  the
Putvin Trail and to connect the two trailheads, about 4.5 miles apart,  with
a bike ride. That was the plan.  But as things  often  go,  my  plan  didn\'t
work out the way I had hoped. I had a great time anyway  and  completed  two
enjoyable rock climbs along the way.

Day 1: After stashing my bike at the Putvin TH (elev  1600  ft),  I  started
from the Lena Lake TH (elev 700 ft). Things began badly right  away  when  I
discovered I hadn\'t replaced my trekking poles  in  my  car  at  home  after
removing them to load my bike. This for me is a major faux pas,  as  I  have
trouble staying upright without poles. I made  due  by  finding  a  suitable
wooden stick in the woods, but it was not the same. Then I was 5 minutes  up
the trail when I remembered  I  had  forgotten  to  set  my  car  alarm.   I
returned to the car and not only was the alarm not set but I  had  not  even
locked the doors.  Good grief! Where was my mind?  At least the rest of  the
hike to Upper Lena Lake (elev 4600 ft) went without  incidence  (7.5  miles,
4050 ft, 5 hrs).

I set up camp in designated site #6 right next to a handy bear  wire.  There
are some dozen designated sites around  the  lake  plus  one  for  a  group.
There is also a ranger stationed here in the summer so it  must  be  a  busy
place then, but on this day I had the entire  lake  all  to  myself.  I  had
hiked up in shorts but it was getting cooler and I was  in  the  process  of
zipping the  legs  back  on  my  convertible  pants  when  the  slider  came
completely off the zipper of the right leg.  Convertible  pants  that  won\'t
convert are next to useless. After much cursing and  gnashing  of  teeth,  I
managed to get the slider back on track and  the  leg  zipped  on,  but  the
zipper was damaged and I had no faith it would hold together.  I  reinforced
it with some strategically placed safety pins. This would be the  last  trip
for these pants.

I now headed for the East Peak of Lena.  It was not far from  camp,  but  it
had taken longer to get to the lake than  anticipated  and  I  had  lost  at
least 30 additional valuable minutes on the zipper episode. Also, I  had  no
prior information on the climbing route.  The most direct route would be  up
the W ridge. However, the close map contours indicated  I  could  very  well
run into difficulties. Any other route would take more time to  figure  out,
and what with the ever-shortening days,  I  may  not  have  enough  daylight
left. Ever optimistic though, I climbed  diagonally  up  from  camp  through
steep meadow to the saddle W of the peak. Climbing through brush out of  the
saddle, I heard that awful buzzing sound of impending doom  as  a  disturbed
yellow jacket nest swarmed out of  the  ground  around  me.  One  nailed  me
between shirt cuff and glove on my  right  wrist,  but  it  could  have  and
should have been much worse. They must have been somewhat lethargic  nearing
the end of their lifespan with the lateness of the year.

With wrist burning, I emerged from  the  brush  onto  the  open  rocky  very
narrow exposed ridge. Goodness gracious!  I was not sure it would  go  as  a
scramble.  But it turned out to not be as bad as it looked and  was  a  very
enjoyable class 3 scramble mostly along the very crest. I  reached  the  top
at 6:15 (.5 mile, 1250 ft, 1:15 hr). An old rusted can and unopenable  glass
jar graced the summit cairn. I added a register of mine. I made it  down  to
camp by 7:30 aided by the light of a  full  moon.  I  ran  into  the  yellow
jackets again, but I was prepared for them and went by  so  fast  (downhill)
that they missed me. I went to sleep that night with the distant  lights  of
Pugetopolis and the full moon framed in my open tent door. Magic!

Day 2: From Upper Lena Lake, I followed the Scout  Lake  Way  Trail  through
lovely meadowy terrain full of tarns and views.  This way trail is  in  good
shape and easily followed to Scout Lake  Pass  (5200  ft).  Here  the  trail
deteriorates and gets harder to follow as it descends on the other  side.  I
got confused several times and had to pause  to  find  the  correct  way.  I
passed Deerheart Lake, then dropped very  steeply  (difficult  with  a  full
pack) to a junction at 4500 ft.  Here I dropped my pack and  took  the  spur
down to Scout lake at 4200 ft. To be honest, I don\'t think it is  worth  the
effort to visit this lake.   It  is  an  awful  trail  down  to  it,  it  is
surrounded by thick forest and has no shoreline to  speak  of.   Camping  is
not allowed but I don\'t know why anyone would  want  to  camp  there  anyway
when there are so many more inviting lakes and tarns and meadows  everywhere
else near by. (Note that  the  7.5  USGS  Mt  Washington  Quad  uses  80  ft
contours, whereas all the surrounding  quads  use  the  more  normal  40  ft
contours. Very odd and very confusing. Makes the  terrain  on  much  of  the
Scout Lake Way Trail appear less steep than it really is.)

I continued from the junction uphill through more lovely meadows  and  tarns
to Stone Ponds Pass elev 5000  ft.  At  this  point  the  trail  essentially
disappeared. I worked my way down to the larger of the ponds, elev 4700  ft,
where I set up my second camp (6 miles, 1650 ft, 4:30  hrs.)   My  plan  now
was to climb The Bandersnatch, a 150 ft spire  mentioned  in  the  guide  as
being N of Stone Ponds and E of Mt Stone\'s N Ridge.  The  only  problem  was
that I didn\'t have a clue as to where this spire was. It is  not  marked  on
any map and I certainly couldn\'t see it from the Pond. It  would  have  been
nice if the guide had indicated how  far  N  from  the  Pond  it  was.  With
nothing more than a direction and a vague elevation of ca.5300 ft to go  on,
I set out N hoping that I would eventually locate it.

I climbed back up to Stone Ponds Pass, then veered left (W)  away  from  the
way trail keeping to the left of the inlet creek to Scout Lake.   Topping  a
small rise I suddenly saw the impressive objective.  There was no  mistaking
the spire. But gee whiz it was a long ways away,  probably  a  mile  as  the
crow flies and across difficult terrain. Once again I  was  worried  that  I
wouldn\'t have enough daylight. It took 1:30 hr to  work  my  way  traversing
bushy cliff terraces to the base of the tower.  It was now 4:45.  The  first
class 4 pitch was a chimney I scrambled up to  the  notch  between  the  two
summits. Here I roped up for the second  80  ft  5.6  class  pitch.  It  was
committing climbing but the  holds  were  good  and  I  was  able  to  place
adequate protection. I reached the summit at 6:00. No register, just  slings
so old as to be completely weathered and useless.  I would guess this  thing
hasn\'t been climbed in several years. (As a note I would estimate the  spire
to be 175 ft high and its elevation to be 5480+ ft)

In order to save weight I had brought only an 80 ft climbing rope and an  80
ft 5mm accessory cord so I could tie the two together for an 80  ft  rappel.
Remind me not to do that again. The rappel worked okay, but  retrieving  the
rope did not. The knot kept getting  stuck.   After  reclimbing  the  entire
pitch to free the knot and fiddling with it as it got stuck a  second  time,
then having the rope get stuck once again  rappelling  the  chimney,  I  was
ready  to  abandon  the  whole  business.  But  I  eventually  succeeded  in
retrieving both ropes - at the cost of an hour. I reached the  base  of  the
rock at 7:00.

Knowing I would never be able to find my way across the  cliff  traverse  in
the dark, I decided to descend straight down  into  the  drainage  of  Scout
Lake\'s inlet creek below the cliffs, then climb back up  on  easier  terrain
past the cliffs.  Although I ran into some nightmare brush  initially  doing
this and it took longer, I eventually ran into meadows and a safer way  back
to camp.  I do not consciously try  to  be  out  after  dark,  but  when  it
becomes necessary and unavoidable, I end up embracing and even enjoying  the
experience. There is something magical about wandering around the  mountains
during the night. It is a whole different world. I was again  aided  by  the
light of a glorious full moon and reached camp at 9:15 (3 miles, 1700 ft,  6
hrs)

Day 3: It rained all night and I awoke to fog and drizzle. I  had  hoped  to
continue my loop but the previous day I had a good look at  the  route  that
would go over the high 5900 ft col called St Peter\'s Gate. It  was  a  rough
1200 ft climb from Stone Ponds on talus and snow. In order  to  save  weight
(I did have all that rock gear), I gambled that I would not need an ice  axe
and did not bring one. I gambled and lost. The final bit to the  col  looked
steep and icy. Not something I wanted to try  without  an  ice  ax  or  even
poles. However, I am not sure I would have tried it even if  I  had  an  axe
under the wet foggy conditions. I had been up the Purvin Trail years ago  to
climb Mt Stone and knew it was  a  steep  difficult  trail  with  scrambling
sections.  It and the descent from  St  Peter\'s  Gate  would  be  even  more
difficult and downright treacherous when wet. So at the moment  of  decision
I trusted my gut feeling, turned my back on St Peter and went out  the  same
way I came in even though it would  be  twice  as  long.  All  was  not  bad
though.  I got to hike back through all those lovely meadows  and  now  have
an excuse to return someday and complete my route.  (12.5  miles,  1450  ft,
7:30 hrs).

Total: 30 miles and 10,100 ft in 3 days

27-29, 2006 (Fri-Sun)

The forecast for this three day period was for clearing from the S  on  Fri,
a sunny day Sat and rain and lowering snow levels coming  in  on  Sun.  Good
enough, I thought, to sneak in a few peaks in the area  before  the  weather
deteriorated and snow accumulated enough to completely prevent access.

Day 1: The weather may have been clearing from the S, but I  was  driving  N
and by the time I got to the Little  Wenatchee  River  TH  (elev  3000  ft),
light rain was still falling. It wasn\'t  really  enough  to  be  much  of  a
problem except for the brush along the trail, which was wet enough  to  soon
soak my feet. I began running into snow below  Meander  Meadow  (about  4500
ft) and in fact lost the trail in the meadow itself so  just  headed  uphill
to intersect it once again on Wenatchee Ridge (5700 ft). Snow was  now  6-12
inches deep, but the wide Pacific Crest Trail was easily  followed  down  to
Indian Pass where I found a pleasant campsite  on  bare  ground  under  some
trees, elev 5000 ft (9 miles, 3000 ft, 5:30 hrs.).

Day 2: It rained all night long, and fairly  hard.  That  supposed  clearing
from the S sure was taking its time. I could almost hear the  meteorologists
spouting their usual  excuse  when  they  blow  the  forecast  -  the  front
stalled. Not only was it not getting better it was  getting  worse.  It  was
discouraging enough that I was seriously considering packing up and  heading
out a day early empty handed. Then toward morning the rain  stopped  and  by
the time I was ready to go at 7:40 I had partial views up  to  Indian  Head.
That was enough to revitalize me and off I went.

I followed the trail a short half mile to the  wooded  SW  ridge  of  Indian
Head and climbed this to wide open slopes where I began a long  traverse  to
the rocky S spur. No real difficulties, unless you count  the  howling  wind
that threatened to blow me off the mountain or the icy rock  that  made  for
slippery going. I topped out at 10:20 (2600 ft, 2:40 hrs).  I found  a  nice
Mountaineer Register placed in 1999 with no pencil, so I  added  one.  There
were a fair number of entries, but I didn\'t take  much  time  to  look  then
over. I couldn\'t hang around too long in the wind  with  my  wet  boots  and
cold feet. Had to  keep  moving.  I  did  however  notice  Stefan  and  Paul
Klenke\'s ascent of last year and several other comments to the  effect  that
the NE Peak appeared to be just as high as the one I was on.  In fact I  was
not sure which peak was the summit looking at the map as they  both  measure
7400 ft by contour lines. So naturally I had to pop over and  climb  the  NE
one also. I still don\'t know which is higher. My altimeter read the same  on
each and I didn\'t bring my clinometer. It looks to be a tossup  to  me,  but
the register is on the SW Peak.

Both the weather and views continued to  improve.  It  was  turning  into  a
gorgeous fall day. Amazing how a little sun  can  make  everything  seem  so
much more friendly. Even the wind diminished. I had  to  make  the  most  of
this opportunity. There was still time to head N  on  the  Crest  trail  and
pick up White Mtn.  This has to be one of the more scenic  sections  of  the
PCT. I had stunning views of Glacier Pk, Luana, Clark,  Tenpeak  and  Kokolo
Pks the whole way to White Pass.  I  then  climbed  a  well-used  way  trail
directly up the S Ridge to the summit of White (5100 ft, 8 hrs).  There  was
no register I could find and I felt any small one I could leave  would  soon
fill up.

I had hoped that if the front on Fri had stalled, maybe  the  one  scheduled
to come in Sun would be late also, but I soon was dissuaded of that  notion.
Already the higher peaks were getting lost in the fog. I  was  beginning  to
worry about getting caught in bad weather my last day, and  yet  I  wouldn\'t
have missed this beautiful day for anything.  I  would  just  have  to  take
what came. I arrived back in camp just at dark (12.5 miles, 5200  ft,  10:30
hrs).

Day 3: Sure enough, sometime during the night it began to rain and the  wind
picked up again. Then the sound of rain  turned  suspiciously  to  something
else - snow. Not that I really mind snow.  In fact I prefer it to rain.   If
it is a dry snow you don\'t get as wet.  And it  is  pretty.  All  white  and
clean and fresh. But if it snowed too much, I might have  trouble  following
the trail out, especially since my plan was to make a  loop  with  the  Cady
Ridge Trail.

I left at 8:45, packing up a frozen ice encrusted tent. It  snowed  all  day
and the snow level continuously went  down.  The  going  was  reasonable  to
Wenatchee Ridge, where I dropped my pack to climb the high point  at  the  N
end.  Somehow I had missed this bump when doing the Poet Peaks.  A  1  hour,
585 ft side trip. Then it began snowing harder and from Wenatchee  Ridge  to
the Cady Ridge Trail breaking trail in over a foot of snow began to slow  me
down. I was still able to follow the trail easily enough, but  with  another
6 inches or so it would be lost under a sea of white. As I plodded along,  I
longed for skis.  The less used Cady Ridge Trail was more of a problem,  but
I managed to lose it only a few times briefly. I  dropped  my  pack  at  the
high point of the trail for the 30-minute, 200 ft side trip up  Cady  Ridge.
It continued to snow all the way down to the car (11.5  miles,  2700  ft.  8
hrs.).

I thought my troubles were over. Not so.  The  DOT  was  caught  with  their
pants down by this early snowstorm and Snoqualmie Pass was  closed  to  both
directions for some  5  hours  while  they  scrambled  getting  tow  trucks,
snowplows and deicing trucks in place to clear the  roadway.  I  sat  for  2
hours in a sea of cars and trucks going nowhere, then crawled over the  pass
for another hour and had a normal 3 hour drive turn into a 6 hour one.

Total: 33 miles and 10,900 ft in 3 days

Mt Muller (3748 ft - 2598P) & Pk 3700+ (850P) - Mt Muller Quad - November
9, 2006

I found this trail to be a real gem, well worth the long  drive.  It  is  in
excellent shape, well maintained, with a number of points of interest  along
the way, has varied ecosystems from near rain forest to open alpine  meadows
and rock outcropping and great views (though I was not able to see  them  on
this misty foggy day). And if I had been content to just stick to the  trail
it would have been a very pleasant experience. But of course I  was  not.  I
just had to add a second peak and turn a simple trip into my usual bash.  At
least that made for a longer hike time than drive time.

I decided to hike the loop trail counterclockwise so I could  get  my  bonus
peak out of the way first.  That way if I ran out of daylight I  would  have
trail to follow the rest of the way out. The first  couple  miles  of  trail
parallels Highway 101 but it is well out of view and  the  trail  is  lovely
with a rain forest look despite parts of it  having  been  recently  logged.
The tread is smooth and begs to be ridden on bike. In fact  the  entire  13-
mile trail is open to mountain bike and could be done  by  a  strong  rider,
but the elevation gain is over 3000 ft and much pushing would  be  involved.


After crossing Hutch Cr in about an hour, the  trail  began  to  climb.   In
another half hour I came to a cluster of giant mossy boulders,  the  largest
of which is named Fout\'s Rock House and is well worth the short  side  trip.
In 2:40 hr I came to the ridge, elev 2800 ft and  set  off  right  along  it
toward Pk 3700. Now this peak is only a little over a mile  away  from  this
point and yet it took me 2 hours to get there. I  am  constantly  amazed  at
how far a mile can be and how long it can take to travel that distance  when
going crosscountry. You would think  I  would  have  learned  that  by  now.
Somehow I thought going along a ridge  would  be  easier  or  that  by  some
miracle there would be a trail or a hint of a trail. All  I  got  was  awful
scrubby trees and brush made even worse by a dusting of wet snow.  At  times
I was literally reduced to crawling under branches to  make  progress.  When
possible I stayed on the N side of the ridge where there was less  brush  in
the dark forest, but for the most part I was forced to stay  on  the  crest.
The actual summit was a rocky mossy knoll that would have had  a  good  view
if I could have seen anything in the fog. At least it wasn\'t raining.

Now there was no way I was going to go back  the  same  way  I  came.   That
would take another 2 hours of misery.   So  I  hatched  an  escape  plan  by
dropping down about 600 ft on the N side to a road that showed  on  my  map.
I then followed this road about 1.5 mile to below  the  saddle  where  I  had
originally left the trail and climbed back  up  500  ft  through  reasonable
open woods to regain the trail. This took  1  hour  and  saved  considerable
time not to mention effort. I then continued on trail to Mt Muller  arriving
just at dark and completed the rest of the loop by headlight.

Total: 16.5 miles, 5345 ft and 9:30 hrs.

This day did not start out well.  I had planned on skiing  up  some  logging
roads on the Clear West Quad, but I found Rd  74  up  the  West  Fork  White
River gated less than a mile from Highway 410. Whether  this  was  a  winter
closure or due to flood damage I am not sure but I  suspect  the  latter.  I
would have continued to Chinook Pass had it been open (it was not) or  could
have continued to Crystal had I been so inclined  (I  was  not).  Instead  I
backtracked to the Mowich Lake Road. I had no idea if this road was open  or
how far I could drive up it. The good news was there was active  logging  in
the area that assured the road was open and I was able to follow very  large
logging truck tire tracks through the snow.  The  bad  news  was  there  was
active logging in the area and I had to dodge half a dozen very large  fully
loaded logging trucks. In any event I was able to make it to  the  Evans  Cr
ORV Park TH, elev 3300 ft, on the edge of Mt Rainer National Park where  6-8
inches  of  untracked  snow  made  skiing  the  extensive  system  of  roads
inviting.

I lost a good hour travel time to my change of  destination.  That  combined
with more time lost on last minute searches in  the  morning  for  ski  gear
long dormant and hidden over the summer meant a not too early start. By  the
time I stepped into my ski bindings it was already 10:30. There are 6  peaks
in this area that I had my sights on, 4 in Rainier  National  Park  (August,
Virginia, Berry and Martin) and two just outside (Poch  and  W  Poch).  With
the late start I knew I wouldn\'t be able to do them all even if  they  could
all be done on skis. So I decided to concentrate on Poch and  W  Poch,  both
of which appeared to have roads to very near the top and could  most  likely
easily be climbed on skis. Even so, it was farther and took  longer  than  I
anticipated just for those two.  At  least  I  had  the  sense  to  put  new
batteries in my headlamp.

It felt good to be skiing again as I glided easily  along  the  gentle  road
through lovely powder snow and I was in heaven. At least  until  heaven  was
shattered when I was passed by a Forest Service truck. They said  they  were
checking out the condition of the ORV trails  in  the  area.  In  the  snow?
Personally I think they were  just  out  playing  in  their  big  truck.  No
matter. I soon met them coming out, having been stopped by  deep  snow,  and
once again I was in heaven. I followed the main road for 5 miles,  with  the
snow getting deeper and trail breaking more work,  to  the  4432  ft  saddle
between W Poch and Poch. From here I went up the NE ridge of  W  Poch  on  a
motorcycle trail that went all the way to the  wooded  top  (1750  ft,  3:40
hrs). Made for very nice skiing indeed. Back at the saddle I then went up  a
road on the W ridge of Poch to its high point, then up semi open  slopes  to
that top (2500 ft, 5:20 hrs). I skied down the E ridge  through  open  woods
to pick up a road that led to the saddle with August Peak. It was  now  4:30
but I was so close to August Peak  I  couldn\'t  pass  it  up.  This  was  in
Rainier Park in dense woods with sketchy snow, so I left my skis  and  hiked
up to that summit, 40 minutes RT. The ski out was by headlamp and  was  very
pleasant until the last mile where more  vehicle  traffic  had  churned  the
road to a chaotic mess. That is always the chance you take  when  skiing  up
an ungated road. Still it did  not  alter  the  fact  that  the  skiing  was
wonderful up to that point and worth putting up  with  a  little  annoyance.

Of course you knew I would be back to pick up the peaks I missed on my  last
outing.  My, but what a difference three days makes. All that heavenly  snow
I skied on was gone. Not that it really mattered, as I  wasn\'t  planning  on
skiing this time anyway.  I was able to easily  drive  to  the  Mowich  Lake
Entrance of Mt Rainier National Park with essentially no snow on  the  road.
I was hoping to take the old Boundary Trail to near  Martin  Pk  but  wasn\'t
sure what shape it was in or if I could even find it. As  it  turned  out  I
had no trouble locating it about  1/10  mile  from  the  entrance,  where  I
parked on the side of the road, elev 3600 ft.

The old trail was in great shape, with only a few minor blowdowns and  would
make for a pleasant hike in  lovely  woods  away  from  the  crowds  in  the
summer. It took two switchbacks before beginning a traverse on  the  E  side
of Martin Pk. The last one dipped out of the park to the W to briefly  enter
a clearcut. Here above me I was astonished  to  see  a  rock  tooth  looming
above in a most unexpected location. I had never  seen  nor  heard  of  this
thing before.  It was impressive enough to deserve a name. Naturally  I  had
to climb over to it to check it out and climb it  if  possible.  I  was  not
able to climb it (it looked to be exposed unprotectable class  5)  but  that
was probably appropriate. On the uphill side I found a  plaque  attached  to
the rock as a  memorial  to  Jack  Pasero,  Jr  of  Wilkeson  "Friend,  Dad,
Companion, 9/4/17 - 12/23/99."  What  a  nice  memorial!   I  wouldn\'t  mind
having something like that for me after I am gone.

Back on the trail, I followed it to the E  side  of  Martin  Pk,  then  went
straight uphill to the summit. I quickly entered  the  snowline.   From  the
look of things Wednesday\'s storm had brought only  rain  and  freezing  rain
(no new snow). The annoying result  was  that  awful  stuff  where  you  are
slipping on ice one moment and wishing for crampons and breaking through  to
knees, or worse, the next and wishing for  snowshoes.  The  last  1/10  mile
probably took half an hour as I alternately slipped and wallowed.  The  snow
was so bad on this peak because it had been clearcut to the  ridgeline  with
resulting deeper drifts and many downed trees (1300 ft, 1:50 hrs)

From Martin I followed the ridge N to  the  saddle  with  Virginia  where  I
picked up the trail again. I then left the trail for good  on  Virginia\'s  W
ridge, which I followed to the top (1550 ft,  2:45  hrs).  From  Virginia  I
went to the saddle to the N,  then  traversed  to  the  ridge  W  of  Berry.
Travel was reasonable through open  woods  despite  inconsistent  snow.  The
final ridge to Berry had a few minor open rocky bumps that  added  a  little
interest but no views to speak of (2300 ft, 4:20 hrs). I backtracked to  the
W saddle then plunged straight downhill to intersect the  Mowich  Lake  Road
(elev 3800 ft) about 6/10 mile from the Paul Peak  TH.  Here  the  road  was
completely snowcovered. There were snowshoe tracks but no ski tracks.

It was now 3:15. I figured I had just enough time to  make  Paul  Pk  before
dark. It appeared from the map that the Paul Pk Trail climbed  to  4200  ft,
which meant I only had 600 ft crosscountry to do. In  fact,  after  dropping
to 3300 ft to cross Meadow Cr, the trail only climbs to  3500  ft  and  then
contours.  So in actual fact I had 1300  ft  crosscountry  to  do.  (Neither
this trail nor the Boundary Trail is shown  accurately  on  the  USGS  quad)
Fortunately, the terrain was friendly and the thick woods held  little  snow
so I still made the summit before dark, though just barely  (3900  ft,  7:30
hrs). I came down by headlight. I guess I am just  not  capable  of  getting
down this time of year while it is still light.  Once  across  Meadow  Cr  I
took a shortcut directly uphill to the road ending  up  2/10  mile  from  my
car.

While none of these peaks has the "required" 400 feet  of  prominence,  they
are all named, (though I am not sure why - the  history  of  that  would  be
interesting) and they make for a satisfying fall trip.

Total: 7 miles, 4250 ft and 9:15 hrs

I have wanted to ski up these peaks for some time now, but in  order  to  do
that conditions had to be just right. There had to be enough  snow  to  ski,
but not so much that I couldn\'t drive  reasonably  close.  The  time  seemed
right and indeed I was able to drive to the Christine  Lake  road  junction,
some 4 miles up Road 59 and elevation 3760 ft. The  last  half  mile  though
was dicey through fresh snow in an old deep track. New tires on my  Cherokee
helped. I was first up the road and thought I had it all to myself,  but  no
sooner had I turned around and parked than a  4X4  came  up  after  me.  The
driver told me I shouldn\'t try to go farther  as  several  rigs  were  stuck
farther up the road. I told him I had no  intention  of  going  any  farther
(Did he really think I would? I was already turned around  and  parked!).  A
few minutes after that a couple from Florida pulled up in  their  SUV.  They
just wanted to see some snow and since Mt Rainier was closed  this  was  the
best they could do. They took off walking the road  toward  Lake  Christine.
Then I was confronted by a monster truck backing down the road  from  above.
They were one of the rigs that had been stuck all night. Goodness  gracious,
it was like Grand Central Station.

Skiing the now churned up road and meeting more stuck or  unstuck  rigs  was
not appealing, so as soon as possible I left the main road at  an  old  road
and headed directly up to Copper Cr Ridge,  elevation  4600  ft.  The  lower
section was quite brushy, but things soon thinned out  and  I  was  able  to
thread my way through open terrain. Once on the ridge, where I had a  fairly
good view of my first destination, I descended straight down  steep  terrain
200 feet to the road on the other side. There were no fresh  vehicle  tracks
here so the rigs were not stuck on this road and I skied  the  road  to  the
Glacier View TH (2 miles, 1280 ft, 2:20 hrs).

The Glacier View Trail was a joy; trail skiing at its best. I had gotten  an
early (for me) start and was making good time so I  was  having  visions  of
adding Puyallup Point and Pk 5480+ to the  itinerary  -  until  I  lost  the
trail as it went around the W side of Pk 5507.  I soon found myself on  very
steep sidehill with difficult travel. I managed to work  my  way  to  the  W
ridge at elev 5300 where I stashed my skis for the final steep climb to  the
summit.  The last bit was tricky icy snow and rock made  worse  by  the  now
deteriorating weather and a brutal wind that blasted me with  pellets  while
threatening to  blow  me  off  the  mountain.  I  didn\'t  tarry  under  such
condition, quickly returning to my skis.

I had to descend several hundred feet down the ridge until I  could  find  a
place to drop to the N. I stumbled onto the trail lower  down  and  followed
it to the saddle S of Glacier View and on to the  summit  itself  (5  miles,
2900 ft 5:40 hrs). The wind was no less brutal  here  but  the  terrain  was
less precipitous so I did not feel unduly threatened.  It was now  2:45  and
a bit late to try for any other peaks so I headed out.  I  found  the  trail
around Pk 5507 and it made for much better skiing.   It  essential  contours
at the 5000 ft level, much lower than shown on the map.

I had the "brilliant" idea of staying on the trail  past  the  Glacier  View
TH, going toward Mt Beljica and then taking the spur  trail  right  directly
to Copper Cr Ridge as shown on the map. This turned out to be a disaster  as
I could not find the trail and ended up in a mess  of  downed  trees.   Ever
try to walk a snowcovered log 10 feet above the ground on  skis.  T-r-i-c-k-
y! Eventually I made it to the ridge very near Pt 4892 but I lost a  lot  of
time. I thought I was now "out of the woods" but things got  even  worse.  I
was able to follow my uphill tracks down for a while but soon lost  them  in
terrible brush the last 200 feet or so to the road. I  ended  up  taking  my
skis off and on several times to slither through.  When  I  finally  reached
the car it was 7:30 (10 miles, 3500 ft, 9 hrs.)


Pk 5480+ (680P) - Mt Wow Quad - November 24, 2006


Despite my difficulties, I really did have a good time on my  previous  trip
so two days later I was back for more hoping this time  to  make  the  other
two peaks - Pk 5480+ and Puyallup Point. I soon realized this would  not  be
likely. There was way too much new snow. I began running into snow just  out
of Eatonville and it just kept getting worse. I was still able  to  make  it
to my previous parking place but only because the monster  trucks  had  kept
the track open. There was probably 1- 1.5 feet of new and let  me  tell  you
it was scary driving up a 3 foot deep trench with no possibility of  getting
out of  it  or  turning  around  until  reaching  the  Christine  Lake  road
junction.

I was even earlier than before and first on the scene.  I learned my  lesson
last  time  and  stayed  on  the  road  resisting  the  temptation  for  any
shortcuts.  Monster trucks have very wide tires, they had been  up  recently
and only an inch or two of fresh snow on the track actually made the  skiing
very good. I reached Copper Cr Pass in 1:10 hrs (3 miles, 925 ft). Here  all
vehicle traffic stopped.  The moment of truth was upon me.  How would it  be
breaking my own trail from now on? It wasn\'t terrible  but  it  wasn\'t  good
either. I sank in about calf deep, deep enough to  make  progress  slow  but
not deep enough to stop me in my tracks. So I plodded on.  It  was  becoming
more and more  likely  that  I  would  not  make  my  peaks.  I  lowered  my
expectations to maybe making one.  If not  even  that,  well  the  snow  was
lovely and I would just enjoy the skiing.

I reached the Glacier View TH in another 1:15 hrs (4.5 miles, 1215  ft)  and
started up the trail. I had hoped that my tracks from  two  days  ago  would
help.  No such luck. They were completely gone and I couldn\'t even find  the
trail around Pt 5419. I lost more time just finding a  route.  I  picked  up
the trail again around Pk 5507.  Skiing is so much easier on a  clear  path.
I reached the Glacier View Saddle at 2:10 (7  miles,  2075  ft,  5:30  hrs).
Clearly if I went on to Pk 5480+ I would be coming out in the dark - way  in
the dark. But I had a nice track to follow out and it was not  snowing  hard
enough to obliterate it. I had worked so hard to  get  to  this  point,  the
peak was so close (well, it really  wasn\'t  THAT  close)  and  the  snow  so
lovely, even if there was too much of it, and so I decided to go on.

I dropped 400 feet to the pond  at  the  base  of  my  peak\'s  S  ridge  and
followed this ridge all the way to the summit, arriving at 4:10 (8.5  miles,
2850 ft, 7:30 hrs).  It really made for a very nice ski ascent.  I  made  it
down to the pond before needing my headlight. The climb back up  to  Glacier
View\'s saddle was an effort, but then it was just a matter of  following  my
ski tracks out.  This was pure joy until the  last  climb  on  the  road  to
Copper Cr Pass. I was running out of steam by that point and  it  seemed  to
take forever. The run down the road was  pretty  good,  despite  the  narrow
track (It seemed narrower on the way down), probably  because  the  road  is
not very steep. But the tracks looked awfully fresh  for  it  having  snowed
most of the day.  Half way down I found out why when I ran  into  a  caravan
of monster trucks.  Three were headed downhill, one uphill and the last  two
were nose to nose in a classic impasse. How they got out of that jam I  have
no idea but I think the three downhill vehicles  solved  the  problem.  They
were experienced enthusiasts. The uphill truck was stuck and driven  by  two
young inexperienced males.  I had a nice conversation with the  one  of  the
experienced crew (a woman) and from what she said  I  gathered  they  didn\'t
think much of them. One of young men made the comment, somewhat  critically,
that I was getting out late.  I almost burst out laughing. It was  okay  for
them to be out after dark but not for me. I chuckled as I  glided  past  the
whole mess. I reached my car at 8:40 (17 miles, 3800 ft, 12 hrs).

Dixie Pk (4606 ft - 402P) and Blowdown Mtn (4560+ ft - 240P) - Mt Si Quad -
November 28, 2006

I had thought the heavy lowland snow would make the  timing  just  right  to
ski up the Mt Teneriffe Road. I was wrong. There was barely an inch  at  the
TH, hardly enough to ski on to start.  I had more snow in  my  driveway!  It
defied the logic that the closer you get to  the  mountains  the  more  snow
there is.  Is North Bend in a snow shadow  or  what?  Whatever  the  reason,
there it was and I had to walk 2.5 miles  to  2100ft  before  I  could  start
skiing. But once I hit skiable snow it was all worth it.  What  lovely  snow
it was and what fantastic skiing.  A road led almost to the treed summit  of
Blowdown. The beginning of the ridge from there to  Dixie  was  dense  trees
and not skiable so I descended the road until I could traverse back  to  the
ridge near the saddle.  This was the only hard part.  The rest of the  ridge
to Dixie was open woods and delightful skiing,  except  for  the  last  1/10
mile, which was narrow and rocky. I hiked the final bit to  the  alpine-like
summit and fine views. I had a wonderful ski down the ridge  until  I  could
drop directly to the main road and a fast ski down the road until the  sound
of rocks scraping my bases made me stop and take off  my  skis.   12  miles,
4500 ft, 8 hrs.  Fay Pullen

I have long been intrigued by the "Tops" around Mineral. The only  one  that
has an official name is Roundtop but the others have all been given  similar
appropriate ones in keeping with that theme.

Spiraltop (2703 ft - 1143P), Towertop (2608 ft - 1088 ft) &  Laketop  (2120+
ft - 640P) - Mineral Quad - December 1, 2006

Taking advantage of low snowlevels, I was able to ski up these  low  summits
near Mineral. The gate on the  Spiraltop  road  was  open  but  all  vehicle
traffic stopped at a downed tree not  far  up.  The  road  was  consistently
covered with snow the whole way and indeed spirals to the top.  Made  for  a
very pleasant ski trip. (5.3 miles, 1280 ft. 2:15 hrs RT)

The road up Towertop and Laketop was gated and the first  half  mile  or  so
deficient of snow. I took a wrong turn a mile up the road and ended up on  a
road that deadended in a clearcut about 400  ft  below  the  summit.  Rather
than backtrack I forced a route to the upper road.  Not pretty  on  skis.  I
probably lost a good  hour.  Snowshoes  would  have  worked  better  in  the
snowcovered slash. There is indeed a tower on Towertop but it is not on  the
top. It was a nice run down to the Laketop road on  consistent  snow  except
for the short descent to near Mineral Lake.  There is  indeed  a  lake  near
Laketop. The road does not go to the tiptop and a short hike  was  required.
By now the snow was freezing which made for a very fast  run  down.  I  came
out the last bit by the light of the almost full  moon.  (10.4  miles,  2415
ft, 5:45 hrs RT)

Doubletop (2180 ft -860P), Stumptop (2080+ ft - 480P) & Roundtop (2670 ft  -
910P) - Mineral Quad - December 6, 2006

 I returned 5 days later to very different conditions.   Much  of  the  snow
had melted but I expected this and came with a bike instead of skis.

I started with Doubletop, parking at the intersection of its road  with  the
Pleasant Valley road although there was no gate. There was only  minor  snow
on the N side and vehicle tracks allowed me to bike the  whole  way  to  the
top. Doubletop does indeed have a double top but I only went to the  highest
one. (3.75 miles, 930 ft, 1:30 RT)

Next up was Stumptop.  Despite a  rather  unattractive  sounding  name,  the
gated, little used, gentle  road  makes  for  a  very  pleasant  bike  ride.
Unfortunately, on this day I ran into too much snow on the N  side  to  bike
the whole way.  Expecting this (from what I found on  Doubletop)  and  since
there were no tire tracks to help out I took along my tiny  kid\'s  skis  and
"skied" the rest of the way to the top. There is indeed a stump on  Stumptop
and I climbed to the top of the stump. (3.3 miles, 690 ft, 2 hrs RT)

I saved the hardest for last. I knew Roundtop  might  give  me  trouble.   I
could see clearcuts fairly high on the S side that were free of snow  but  I
saw no road cuts. And from the map contours, and cliffs  I  could  see,  the
upper part was very steep. I couldn\'t find any TR to help  either,  although
I know both Stefan and Klenke have done this (and the  other)  peaks  fairly
recently.  I really need a better filing system. Somehow I  muddled  through
despite several false starts. I began at the gated road, passed a  promising
road to the right (not shown on my map) at the second switchback  and  biked
a pleasant additional mile to the N side where I soon  got  bogged  down  in
snow.  I took a short spur that deadended but gave a view of snowy  cleacuts
above.  There must be a road that accessed  the  clearcuts  but  even  if  I
found it it would do no good, as there was too much snow  to  bike  or  even
ski with my tiny skis.  So it was back to the friendly sunny S side and  the
junction I had originally passed by. I went up this road a short  ways  then
took a hard left on a spur that ended below a clearcut, elev 1800  ft.  (The
main road probably circled around to the clearcuts I  had  seen  on  the  NE
side) From here I forced a route the  remaining  900  ft  to  the  top.   An
animal trail helped greatly to get me to  the  top  of  the  clearcut,  then
steep wooded slopes wound through cliffs to the summit  ridge  where  I  was
greeted with a stunning view of a frosted white  Mt  Rainier.  A  2/10  mile
walk  along  the  ridge  led  to  the  summit.  This  was  turning  into  an
interesting little peak. Roundtop is indeed round on top  but  it  is  quite
steep on all sides. (6.6 miles, 1400 ft, 3 hrs RT including side trips)

Although I got back to the car before dark (but only barely),  it  was  dark
by the time I drove through Mineral, Elbe and Eatonville, so I was  able  to
enjoy the Christmas lights and decorations these small towns  have  put  up.
Then to cap it off, just outside of Eatonville at the first gas station,  on
Highway 161, a "Christmas Truck" was parked with lights  and  music  blazing
and blaring.  I have never seen anything like this truck.  I  think  it  was
sponsored by Ohop Light or some such.  Made me smile all the way home.

The challenge with biking up little peaks like these is finding a road  that
gets you as close as possible to the summit.  Since  I  do  not  use  aerial
photos (too much time and effort to download on my  old  slow  computer),  I
must rely on maps, many of which are not  up  to  date,  trip  reports  from
other peakbaggers if I can find them (I know Stefan has done some or all  of
these peaks), on-site visual inspection and  just  plain  luck.  This  often
results in surprises, some good and some bad. But it all adds to the  spirit
of exploration and I do like to explore. This trip everything went well  and
I managed to fit all five hoped for peaks in one day, although the last  one
was done in the dark.

I went for the  farthest  and  highest  one  first,  Pk  2480+,  biking  the
mainline logging road some 3 miles to the spur junction. This  is  the  only
one I ran into significant snow on, which began  about  1800  ft,  but  tire
tracks allowed me to bike to just below the  summit.  I  next  went  for  Pk
1760+. This one had the most crosscountry work, 400 ft  up  a  steep  wooded
hillside with just enough downed trees and debris to  be  annoying  but  not
obnoxious. Then on to Pk 2000+ where a new road extension (I could  see  the
roadcut from below) switchbacked to the ridge. Only a short hike was  needed
to reach the wooded top.

The day was now waning, but I thought I still could get up Destitution  Hill
before dark if I was lucky enough to find a road to the top. I  was  and  it
did, although the road I found was not on my map at all. When I got back  to
the car and loaded the bike it was dark, but I was right next to  Pelletgun.
How could I not go for it? I drove the short distance to the gated  road  up
this hill.  Rather than take  the  trouble  to  unload  the  bike  again,  I
decided to just hike the whole way. The road went all the way to  the  ridge
and a cat track littered with slash led along the ridge to the  top.  Except
for the slash section, I was able to hike without a headlamp  by  the  light
of a full moon. It was actually quite lovely.  Surely more lovely  than  the
clearcut would have been in the daylight.

Total for 4 peaks by bike: 19 miles, 3550 ft & 7 hrs.
Additional for Pelletgun: 3.2 miles, 750 ft & 1:20 hrs.

I thought I might be in for real trouble when I found  residual  snow  along
the Mountain Loop Highway where I  parked  at  the  gated  logging  road.  I
expected some snow higher up but not here at only 600 ft  elevation.  As  it
turned out, the snow was only in  protected  areas,  the  logging  road  was
clear and I was able to easily bike the 3+ miles up the E ridge to near  the
top of Miniature Mtn (I believe this peak was recently named  by  Roper).  A
short trek on foot through debris-laden woods took me the rest of the way.

I was now pondering how to proceed to Siberia Mtn.  None of my  maps  showed
roads connecting directly from Miniature Mtn without major backtracking  and
loss of elevation. I had no view from the summit  itself  but  came  upon  a
decent one while biking down the W ridge. I  could  see  a  road  cut  in  a
clearcut on the S slope of Siberia that did not correspond to  any  road  on
my map. Perhaps this road connected to the one I was  on.  I  optimistically
proceeded on this assumption and, by following  the  most  traveled  looking
road at the many junctions encountered,  soon  found  myself  just  where  I
wanted to be. I climbed to a high point of 1850 ft,  turned  a  corner  into
more snowy terrain and began a gradual descent. I was  looking  for  a  spur
that my map showed to climb fairly high on the NW slope.  I found  the  spur
but I also found too much snow to take it any distance.

I decided to continue to Dalhberg and try Siberia on  the  way  back  via  a
spur I had passed on the S slope. I could  see  a  log  landing  directly  S
across a deep ravine on the N slope of Dalhberg. It  looked  so  close,  but
getting to it was a round about business. Now even the main road was  snowy.
Fortunately, vehicle tracks made it possible for me to continue until I  got
through the snowy section. I found my way to the log landing  from  where  I
proceeded on foot to the summit of Dalhberg. It was only 2/10 mile away  but
took almost 20 minutes to cover  the  snowy  stickery  slash.  Then  to  add
insult to injury I crossed another spur road very  near  the  top.  I  could
have avoided the whole nuisance altogether if I had found this one.

I next went for Pk 2080. I could see a  tower  on  the  top  of  this  peak.
Where there is a tower there is a road. All I had to do was find it. This  I
did with only a few minor detours. First I had to  descend  another  hundred
feet or so to a very good road coming up from the S. Then  I  just  followed
this main road, which was a real dream to bike, and then  the  tracked  road
when I got into snow again and I ended up at the tower.   Unfortunately  the
tower was not on the tiptop, so I had  another  unpleasant,  but  mercifully
short, flounder through snowy debris to the summit.

An hour later I was back at the spur road I had passed going up the  S  side
of Siberia. I was able to bike this about half a mile  before  running  into
the deepest snow of the trip. Tire tracks helped for a  quarter  mile  until
the last switchback where  even  they  gave  up.   Then  it  was  postholing
through calf deep slush for another quarter mile to the  end  of  the  road.
Again the summit was a little higher. When I returned  to  my  bike  it  was
5:30 and dark. By now my feet were soaked but I had dry  socks  to  put  on.
Fortunately it was positively balmy for this time of year and I did not  get
cold.
I had not planned on this trip taking so long (I  should  have  known.  They
always take longer than I think) so did not have my good  bike  light  along
(it is very heavy and I only take it when I am sure  I  will  need  it).  Of
course I did have a headlamp - I ALWAYS have a  headlamp.  But  it  did  not
give adequate light to allow for normal speed downhill and I had to keep  it
way down. Then, taking the lower road back around Miniature Mtn (I  had  not
come up this way) I ran into dozens of downed trees. A real  windstorm  must
have come through here. Most were easily passed around, over or  under,  but
a few needed assistance from my folding saw before I could get by. All  this
probably made the trip out an hour longer than it should  have  been  and  I
reached the car at 7:00.

Total: 21.6 miles by bike, maybe 1.6 miles on foot, 4360 ft, 10 hrs.

560P), Flat Tire Hill (1460+ ft - 720P) & Pk 1480+ ft (700P) - Granite
Falls Quad - December 12, 2006

I really thought I was going to  get  drenched  on  this  trip  and  I  went
prepared for rain and to bail out early if things got too bad.  But the  day
turned out quite nice, much better than expected and I only got a half  hour
or so of moderate rain toward the end of the day.  I  was  hoping  to  drive
farther up Scotty Road than I was able to. A gate stopped me  about  a  mile
up the road.  It was open but logging trucks were coming  and  going  and  I
felt there was a good possibility it would be closed by the time I  got  out
even though there was no sign saying it might be. There was  a  sign  saying
no unauthorized vehicles allowed and many making it  clear  no  parking  was
allowed by the gate. Now I am very paranoid  about  where  I  park  my  car.
Since it was going to be there  all  day,  I  thought  it  prudent  to  look
elsewhere and I found an unobtrusive spot out of the way about .8 mile  back
(elev 580 ft). No big deal on a bike.

I thought I was in trouble when at about another .8 mile  past  the  gate  I
came upon the active operations of the  O\'Brien  Sand  and  Gravel  Company.
This was right smack in the middle of the road at the junction to  the  spur
up Flat Tire Hill. But just then a logging truck came by  so  the  road  was
obviously passable and open.  Sure enough, a bypass went around  the  gravel
pit and reconnected with the road farther  up.  I  came  upon  another  gate
after another mile. This one did say it could be  closed  at  any  time  but
also said the area was open to hiking, biking and horseback riding.  I  felt
better knowing I was not in there illegally.

I left the logging truck traffic where I took the uphill  road  at  Chitwood
Lake.  They had cleared the road this far.  Now there were many  more  trees
down, however all but two (maybe these  came  down  in  the  previous  day\'s
storm) had been cut through just enough to allow passage of a pickup  truck.
My folding saw came in handy on those two.  Other  than  that  the  road  to
Worthy was a joy to bike, although it did get  steep  toward  the  top.  The
summit was just off the clearcut in the woods  above  the  tower  (8  miles,
1800 ft, 2:50 hrs).

Next up was Olfactory.  From Worthy I could see a road went all the  way  to
the top, even though my map did not show one. I made a fast run down to  the
junction of the road up Olfactory.  This road was fairly steep, didn\'t  look
well used and I mostly pushed up. It went very close  to  the  summit,  with
only a few steps into the usual brush required (14 miles, 2900 ft, 5 hrs).

From Olfactory I could see a road switchbacking to the top of Pk  1480+  but
I couldn\'t see where the road came from.  There were  two  possibilities.  I
tried the first one I came to first. It was not the right one  and  I  ended
up wasting about 45 minutes before I figured that  out.  The  next  road  in
line was the one up Flat Tire Hill. Again a bypass  had  been  built  around
the gravel operation to access this road, although it  practically  entailed
going head to head  with  their  big  machines.  I  felt  mighty  small  and
vulnerable but no one there gave me any trouble. This was another road  that
was a pleasure to bike at least until I got to the summit  area.  There  are
three points here with the same map elevation.  I  hate  summits  like  that
because I never know which is the highest and usually end up  going  to  all
of them just to be certain. I first went to the  two  southern  points.  The
eastern one was tolerable being the usual annoying brush  and  stickers  but
the western one was unbelievable. It was such a jumble of overgrown  rotting
downed trees and brush it was almost impossible to move  through  it.  There
was no solid ground underfoot, just logs  and  chest  deep  holes.  To  make
matters worse this is when my 30 minutes  of  rain  decided  to  fall.  Even
though I was within 350 linear feet according to my GPS, I probably spent  a
good 20 minutes wandering around looking for the high point. I am  not  even
sure I found it.  How can you tell when you are  in  head  high  garbage?  I
just trusted my GPS. A ditched but hikeable old road went  .2  mile  to  the
northern point. It read 10 ft higher  on  my  altimeter  than  the  southern
points which both read the same. I called it the summit (22 miles, 4100  ft,
8:15 hrs).

It was now 5:00 and dark but I still had one peak I wanted to  do.  When  it
started to rain I seriously  considering  forgetting  the  whole  thing  and
beating a hasty retreat.  Then the rain quit and my resolve returned. I  was
smart enough this time to bring my  good  bike  light  along  so  I  had  no
trouble zipping down to the main road. Amazing  what  a  difference  a  good
light makes when biking. Then it was a second try up the  next  road  to  Pk
1480+.  This one did the trick. It led all the way to a  new  cleacut  right
on the summit. (27 miles, 5035 ft, 9:50 hrs). I doubt this  summit  is  very
attractive in the daylight but  I  had  a  lovely  view  of  the  lights  of
Everett.

Both gates were closed when I came out.

Total: 30 miles, 5035 ft, 10:20 hrs.

Pk 4097 (537P) & Layercake Pk (3909 ft - 429P) - The Rockies Quad -
December 14, 2006

The less said about this trip the better.  This was the day before the  "Big
Wind Storm" and silly me thought I would beat the weather. I did not.  There
was torrential rain all day long and the wind began kicking up  much  sooner
than expected. I drove to the snowline at 2500 ft on Rd 74  and  skied  from
there. If you discounted the wind and rain the  skiing  was  actually  quite
good. Roads went very near the tops of both peaks, although  the  road  from
Pk 4097 to Layercake was much more overgrown than I expected.  Both  summits
were open and would make for fine viewpoints in better weather. I had  hoped
to perhaps also do Goodie or Ladd on this trip but the  conditions  were  so
bad I gave it up early and retreated like a drowned rat.  I  felt  lucky  to
get out before trees started falling.

16 miles, 3960 ft and 8:30 hrs.

Snugtop (2880+ ft - 720P) & TV Tower Hill (3600+ ft - 1080P) -  Anderson  Lk
Quad - December 19, 2006

This was 5 days after the "Big Wind Storm" and the power was  still  out  at
my home. I wasn\'t sure what I would run into on back roads, but I figured  I
might as well be out and about.  I would be warmer exercising  outside  than
vegetating inside a cold house. I started from the gated logging  road  near
Roundtop, elev 1400 ft, on bike. No sooner did  I  turn  a  corner  not  100
yards from the car than I was greeted by two very large cedar  trees  across
the road. Darn! This did not bode well for the rest of  the  trip.  Still  I
had nothing better to do and only a cold house to return  to  so  I  may  as
well give it a try. I struggled and huffed  and  lifted  my  bike  over  the
obstruction and much to my surprise was able to bike to the  grassy  end  of
the spur road below Snugtop mentioned in Paul  Klenke\'s  recent  TR.  I  was
helped by the previous passage of ATV\'s who had  cut  or  forced  their  way
through several more  downed  trees.  They  were  probably  locals  who  had
obviously gained access another way. Even ATV\'s couldn\'t get over the  large
cedars. From the end of the road it was a  pleasant  1:30  hour  RT  through
mostly open woods to the wooded top. I found Paul\'s cairn  on  top  a  stump
but his film can register was nowhere to be seen.

I continued up the main road another 3 miles to a junction where  the  ATV\'s
went left and I went right where I  was  almost  immediately  stopped  by  a
large windfall that I couldn\'t get my bike through so I continued  on  foot.
Too bad as the rest of the road was mostly clear and  I  could  have  easily
biked another 2 miles to where I left the road at 2700 ft. From here I  went
up now snowy woods and debris to the top where I did not find a TV Tower.

15.4 miles, 3465 ft and 8 hrs.


Mt Goodie (4040+ ft - 640P - Mineral Quad), Quiemuth Pk (2922 ft  -  762P  -
Eatonville Quad); and Stahl Mtn (3716 - 756P) & Ladd Mtn (3920+ ft  -  520P)
- The Rockies Quad - December 21, 2006

I was determined to snag Mt Goodie (after several previous  failed  attempts
due to lack of time or bad weather) and finish off the Mineral  Quad.  Again
I wasn\'t sure of the condition of back roads after "The Wind Storm" and  how
far I could drive. This time I tried the approach from the N side up a  spur
off Rd 74. I was able to drive to the snow line at 2700 ft  only  having  to
cut out one small tree. From here I skied the road all the way to  the  top,
very easy skiing. 4.5 mile, 1370 ft and 2 hrs.

Goodie went so well I decided to see what else I could accomplish this  day.
 I continued on Rd 74 to the spur heading up the E side of  Ladd  but  found
it washed out a short ways up. Back to Highway 7  and  the  Pleasant  Valley
Rd.  Past all the farms this road becomes the N end of Rd 74, which used  to
be a loop but now does not go all the way  through.  It  wanders  for  miles
circling Quiemuth Pk and I didn\'t have much hope of it being  drivable  very
far.  But it was. Someone had been through and cut out trees just enough  to
get by.  It was slow going  with  many  obstacles  but  eventually  I  found
myself at the junction of the spur up Quiemuth. I was soon stopped  on  this
spur by a large windfall, elev 2000 ft, but I was now close enough  to  hike
the spur to its end S of the summit. A  short  350  ft  climb  through  open
woods led to the summit cairn and register  where  I  found  out  it  was  a
county high point. Duh!   Another  CoHP  bites  the  dust  without  me  even
knowing it. I wonder how many CoHPs I will have  done  by  the  time  I  get
around to going after this list. The entire  trip  was  snowfree.  3  miles,
1045 ft, 2 hrs.

I continued on the main road to the saddle  between  Stahl  and  Ladd,  elev
2960 ft. Here I was surprised to find a lovely trail, although  now  with  a
number of recent blowdowns, leading all the way to the summit.  Made  for  a
fast trip. Again completely snowfree. 1.5 miles, 800 ft, :50 hrs.

It was now after 4:00 but I was so close I  wasn\'t  leaving  without  adding
Ladd. I was only able to drive on a short distance before being  stopped  by
snow, elev 3020 ft. I walked the road until  I  spotted  a  reasonably  open
line up the snowcovered clearcut to the W ridge. Here  I  followed  edge  of
the ridge to the snowcovered summit. I came down by headlamp as it began  to
snow. It was really very pretty. 1.5 miles, 875 ft, 1:22 hrs.

December 17, 2006

I did these peaks two days after the big windstorm and  was  totally  amazed
how quickly people living in rural areas get  their  roads  open.  Owning  a
chainsaw must be a requirement for these  residents.  That  is  not  to  say
anyone had power. At almost every home I heard a generator running.  In  any
event I thought I might have trouble getting anywhere, but  I  was  able  to
drive Scott Turner Road off the Eatonville Cutoff all the way past the  last
residence and into the Elbe State Forest. I parked along the road  as  close
as I could get S of the summit  of  Dobbs,  elev  1900  ft,  and  then  went
straight uphill  through  surprisingly  open  and  pleasant  forest  to  the
summit.  A large cairn and a reasonable view graced the top. 1 mile, 875  ft
and 1:10 hrs.

I continued along the road another several miles to  the  seasonal  gate  on
the road going up Pk 3200+, elev 2744 ft. Here there was  about  1-2  inches
of fluffy powder snow. I carried skis along but soon abandoned that idea  as
the snow was not deep enough or substantial enough to cover the road  gravel
and I ended up just hiking. The road itself was too flat  and  long  for  my
taste and I cut up through a clearcut as soon as possible  to  intersect  it
higher up. From the end of the road, in a new clearcut, a  final  unpleasant
section through twisted trees led to the high point.  It was  not  clear  to
me if the mess was caused by the windstorm or by logging. Probably  both.  5
miles, 635 ft and 2:30 hrs.

Back to the Eatonville Cutoff, I turned onto Mashel Road and drove as  close
as I could below the E side of Alder BM  parking  just  before  numerous  No
Trespassing signs adorned high fences on both sides of the road,  elev  1620
ft. An initial stickery brushy section of old clearcut was soon followed  by
more reasonable woods.  I found the BM on top. .5 mile, 565 ft and :50 hrs.

I just had time to try for Reliance Hill before total darkness. I  ended  up
doing a carbon copy of Klenke\'s trip, although  I  didn\'t  know  it  at  the
time, as I didn\'t remember his TR even though I had read it.  (I  reread  it
afterward.)  I drove Little Dale Rd off Highway 7 to  a  wide  parking  area
below a clearcut (elev 1700 ft) climbed up the clearcut to a fence,  crossed
the fence and snuck up to the mossy boulder summit above a picnic table  and
observation deck. Stealth was aided by dusk and the covering  sound  of  the
generator running at the nearby home. Although I did not  encounter  any  no
trespassing signs it was clearly private property and I felt the  thrill  of
a tresbagger.  Paul you would have been proud of me. .2  mile,  160  ft,  15
minutes.

Ohop BM (2335 ft - 535P) & Pk 2400+ (400P) -  Lake  Kapowsin  Quad;  and  Pk
2040+ (640P) & Hugo Pk (1740+ - 120P) - Eatonville Quad - December 23, 2006

The first two peaks turned out to be a splendid bike ride  on  a  series  of
well-graded logging roads with  few  difficulties  other  than  finding  the
proper way at the many junctions. I began at the gate  on  the  Weyerhaeuser
Mainline just outside Eatonville, elev 1000 ft. I was stopped  by  a  single
fallen tree .9 mile from the summit of Ohop BM and had to walk  from  there.
Some snow the last bit. The road was clear all the way  to  the  top  of  Pk
2400+. Again some snow near the top but not enough to hinder my  bike.  20.8
miles, 3120 ft, 5:17 hrs.

I still had time left to zip over to Pack Forest and bike  up  Hugo  and  Pk
2040+. The gate on the normally open road was closed, elev 940 ft. This  was
probably due to storm damage.   Even  though  the  many  downed  trees  were
already cut out on the main roads, there was much  debris  lying  about  and
the secondary roads still needed work. In fact the final spur to Hugo was  a
disaster and I could barely make it through on foot. 6.5 miles, 1260 ft  and
1:55 hr.

Peak 4235 (595P) - Easton Quad - January 11, 2007


This was a Plan B trip. I awoke to 5 inches of snow  at  my  house  Thursday
morning. With that much snow on the ground so low I had  visions  of  skiing
up Mt Teneriffe again, this time right from the gate (last  time  I  had  to
walk 2.5 miles to skiable snow), or  even  Rattlesnake  Mtn  if  roads  were
really bad. Well, I did have trouble getting out  of  my  neighborhood,  but
the amount of snow diminished rapidly and by the time I  got  to  Tiger  Mtn
Summit and then North Bend there was only a dusting of snow,  hardly  enough
to ski on. I could hardly believe it. This area must  truly  be  in  a  snow
shadow.  This is the 3rd  time  this  winter  I  have  experienced  such  an
anomaly. So I had no choice but to continue on to Plan B. You should  always
have a Plan B.

I-90 was completely clear and I could drive the speed limit all the  way  to
Easton. Even with my late start (10:30 at the lot - I  waited  for  daylight
to start the drive so I could see the ice),  the  Sno-Park  was  empty  with
about 3 inches of untracked fluffy powder over a crust. Cold and sunny -  10
degrees.  Made for wonderful road skiing the 5 miles  to  below  Peak  4235.
Then up a clearcut to the top. Down a different clearcut.  Not quite  enough
powder for great turns but not bad. Great views. With time left,  I  decided
to go up Point 4114. More good skiing and views of  Goat  Pk.   Also  got  a
good view of Monohan Mtn across Tucker  Cr  where  I  could  see  roads  and
clearcuts that looked like they would make for another good ski  tour.  Back
to the car before dark. Only met 2 snowmobiles at the end of  the  day  near
the Sno-Park.

Total - 13.5 miles, 2650 ft and 6:30 hrs.

More lowland snow when I woke up caused another  late  start  but  not  much
trouble driving to Easton. Conditions at the Easton  Sno-Park  were  similar
to when I was there last Thursday - another  inch  or  so  powder  over  the
previous 3 inches on top of a hard rain crust and cold at 16  degrees,  with
light snow showers. There was evidence of much snowmobile traffic  over  the
holiday weekend but again the lot was empty when I arrived on this Tuesday.

I again skied up the road toward Goat Pk and Pk 4235, but this time  took  a
left onto an old road at 3 Â¼ miles. I was able to follow this  road  another
mile until I lost it (or it ended) in the valley bottom. I  crossed  several
small creeks to the base of the SW slope of Tucker where  I  left  my  skis.
The hillside was much too steep and crusty for skis.  In fact it was  almost
too crusty for boots.  I was wishing I had  brought  an  ice  axe  and  even
crampons. Once on the ridge crest it  was  more  pleasant  going.  From  the
summit I had a nice view of Pk 4235, but Goat Pk was lost in the  clouds  (5
miles, 1500 ft, 3:30 hrs).

Heading back on the main road I went right on a well-used  (by  snowmobiles)
road that is 2 Â¼ miles from the Sno-Park. At the third  switchback  most  of
the snowmobile tracks went downhill  toward  Easton.  I  (and  a  few  stray
snowmobile tracks) went uphill two more switchbacks to  gain  the  ridge  at
about 3100 ft and 1.75 miles. The road then wandered the crest for another  0.75
mile until it ended in a clearcut below  Pt  3525.  Here  a  steep  traverse
required removal of skis to regain the ridge. A  final  pleasant  ski  along
the ridge led to the summit (10.5 miles, 3200 ft, 6:50 hrs).

It was now 4:45 and getting dark. I could play it safe and just  reverse  my
up route, most of which was road and easily skied by headlamp. But  I  could
see the main road directly below me with a clearcut going much  of  the  way
down from the saddle between the summit and Pt 3525 and  I  couldn\'t  resist
taking that route.  Luckily the clearcut, though not great skiing,  was  not
overly steep and had just enough fresh snow over the crust that I could  ski
it.  I did take skis off for a crusty section in the lower woods and to  get
across the swampy creek in the valley bottom. I regained the  main  road  on
the other side about 1.5 miles from the Sno-Park. Total:  13.5  miles,  3300
ft and 8:30 hrs.


"Little Pk" (3440+ ft - 560P) - Easton Quad - January 18, 2007


I returned to the area two days later, this time accompanied  by  my  friend
Christine, for a very pleasant short tour. From Exit 78 off  I-90  we  drove
to the end of a plowed road, elev  2460.  It  was  21  degrees  and  snowing
lightly with 1 inch new. From  here  the  road  dropped  slightly  to  cross
Little Cr, then paralleled the powerline a flat mile  to  a  switchback.   A
designated and well-used snowmobile route  went  straight  while  we  turned
left uphill. The road continued  another  couple  miles  to  very  near  the
summit with only a short distance required XC through the woods to the  top.
By now the light snow was turning to freezing rain. This did  not  adversely
affect the  skiing  but  did  make  the  drive  back  over  Snoqualmie  Pass
troublesome. 8 miles, 1400 ft and 4 hrs.  Fay Pullen

This trip was almost entirely  on  groomed  snowmobile  roads.  And  with  a
rapidly  rising  freezing  level  I  certainly  didn\'t  expect  any  quality
downhill terrain or conditions. I was pleasantly  surprised.  I  began  from
the Woods and Steele Sno-Park S of  Cle  Elum.  The  groomed  road  remained
fairly icy the entire gentle 5 miles of climbing on the shady N  side  to  S
Cle Elum Ridge, but I was able to climb without skins.  Once  on  the  ridge
and in the sun the snow began to soften up until by the time I was  climbing
cross country to my two summits, the lovely powder of a day or two  ago  had
turned to a melting soggy sticky  mess  that  stuck  to  my  skis  in  heavy
clumps. Despite  the  painful  ascent,  the  descent  off  both  peaks  down
clearcuts was amazingly good skiing.  A total of  some  1400  ft  of  linked
turns. Not bad, not bad at all. But then I discovered  I  had  neglected  to
put my regular glasses in my pack (they were left sitting on the front  seat
of my car). That made the final hour out by  headlamp  down  the  road  very
slow and a bit of a hazard.  Ever try  skiing  at  night  by  headlamp  with
sunglasses  on?  Rather  diminishes  what  you  can  see.   Remember  I   am
practically blind without my prescription glasses so my choices were to  ski
without my glasses and not see anything despite having  more  light  or  ski
with my sunglasses on and see but have  very  little  light.   I  chose  the
latter.

Total: 18 miles, 4500 ft and 8:20 hrs.

I began this trip from the end of plowing on the South Cle Elum  Ridge  Road
3350. Although a designated and groomed snowmobile route, there was no  Sno-
Park here and almost no parking, with barely a spot to put my  one  car.  It
was foggy and 24 degrees and conditions were so icy  I  needed  skins  right
away even on the gentle road. Since I had skins on, I  figured  I  might  as
well try a short cut up a lesser road.  Bad idea.  I took a wrong  turn  and
ended up on a deadend at a building.  I forced a route XC on awful crust  to
the correct road but soon gave that up also and  just  went  uphill  to  the
main road where I should have stayed to begin with. At least it was  groomed
and smooth. At least until the turnoff to Peoh Pt where a steep section  was
so rutted as to be virtually unskiable. I walked. Temperatures stayed  below
freezing with only open areas in full sun softening up. I had maybe a  dozen
quality turns off Cle Elum Pt.  That was it for any decent  downhill.  There
seem to be two equal summits to the east end of South  Cle  Elum  Ridge  and
not knowing which was higher I climbed them both.  My altimeter implied  the
west one was higher by some 30 feet.  Skiing off that peak XC  was  strictly
survival style. But the final run down the road, in daylight this time,  was
sheer bliss. It sure helps when you can see.  4  miles  and  1500  ft  in  a
blazing half hour.  Fun, fun, fun. Groomed snowmobile roads  do  have  their
upside.

The Ark (5339 ft - 739P)  - Lake Philippa Quad - February 2, 2007


The Middle Fork Snoqualmie River Road is as potholed  as  ever,  maybe  even
made worse, if that is possible, by rutted snow and ice the last bit to  the
Taylor River TH. It made for very slow driving. The  "trail"  itself,  along
the old road was snow compacted by many footprints and easy traveling.  Most
footprints stayed with the Taylor River, only a few, notably  including  one
set of snowshoe prints, turned left onto the old Quartz  Cr  road  .4  miles
up. The snow was hard enough to make snowshoes unnecessary.  I left mine  in
the car, electing instead to bring only  crampons.  About  2  miles  farther
both Mr. Snowshoe and I took a right onto an even older  road.  Mr  Snowshoe
stuck to the road but I soon grew weary of road plodding and found  it  more
interesting, if not faster, to cut  straight  up  through  the  fairly  open
woods crossing the road twice more. Soon the terrain  steepened  and  became
more open and out came the ice axe and crampons. I  worked  my  way  into  a
basin SW of the summit and onto the S ridge, following  this  ridge  to  the
top (4 miles, 4300 ft, 4:45 hrs) The summit rocks were melted out enough  to
make the cairn visible but I found no register. Views were all  around.  The
snow warmed sufficiently by the time I left that I didn\'t need crampons  for
the descent. I don\'t know where Mr Snowshoe went but I never saw his  tracks
above where I left the road. For the plod out  the  road  I  was  pleasantly
distracted by an almost  constant  view  of  the  impressive  cliffs  of  Mt
Garfield.

Another Middle Fork Peak, this one started from the  Middle  Fork  TH.  Once
across the Middle Fork Bridge, I went downstream (right) around the  toe  of
The Choirboy (yet to do) on the old river trail until it crossed  Rainy  Cr.
Here I lost the way for a  while  in  snow  and  brush  and  thrashed  about
looking for the old Rainy Lake trail.  I had never been up  this  trail  and
didn\'t know exactly where it was (I climbed Preacher  and  Caroline  from  a
camp at Wildcat Lake). Eventually I found the trail and managed to  stay  on
it, through intermittent snow, for a couple of miles to about 3000  ft.  Old
tracks from two groups who had recently climbed Preacher Mtn helped. I  then
went  straight  uphill  through  steep  but  easy  open  woods  and   mostly
consistent snow to the 4040 ft saddle N of the  false  summit  and  followed
the ridge to the top (3700 ft, 5 hrs). Views were hard to  come  by  as  the
entire route, including the summit, was in the trees. The snow was soft  and
slushy and inconsistent in lower areas and  made  for  slow  going.  It  was
reasonably solid for the climb to the saddle but I needed  neither  ice  axe
nor crampons. Snowshoes (which I left in the car) wouldn\'t  have  been  that
helpful either as there was much bare ground where the soft  snow  was  most
annoying.  It began to rain on the way out. I almost made  it  before  dark,
only needing my headlamp for the last 15 minutes.

Total: 8 miles, 3950 ft and 8:50 hrs.

Frog Mtn (4880+ ft - 400P - Blanca Lk Quad) & Silica Mtn (5400+ ft - 880P  -
Evergreen Mtn Quad) - February 11, 2007

I climbed these peaks with Stefan and company - well sort of. Despite  heavy
rain on the drive to Jack Pass, it conveniently stopped raining just  as  we
started and we even had some clearing. I  really  wanted  to  ski  Frog,  so
carried skis to the top while snowshoeing so I could be with  the  group.  I
had a nice time chatting with Natala and enjoying a gorgeous  view  of  Bear
Mtn on the way up. We regrouped on top (2300 ft &  2  hrs).  Stefan,  Chris,
Kathy and Stan continued along the ridge  toward  Silica.  Greg,  Sarah  and
Natala headed down to the cars.

My original intention was to just ski down Frog and  then  perhaps  ski  San
Juan Hill. (I have already climbed San Juan but have never skied it.   I  do
think it would make a fine ski trip.)  But the start of the ridge to  Silica
was so inviting, I decided at the last minute to ski along it  for  a  ways.
Well, the ridge just kept going and I just  kept  going  with  it.   I  kept
expecting it to get nasty, at which point I was just going to bail and  turn
around. But it never did. It really was a lovely ridge  and  I  do  so  love
ridges. It did get a little narrow and steep  in  a  few  spots  and  I  did
remove my skis a couple of times but it was nothing  serious.   Then  I  met
Kathy and Stan coming back. They had turned around at a steep traverse  past
a small pinnacle. This worried me, but when I got to  the  traverse  it  was
not too bad. Stefan and Chris had very good steps  for  me  to  follow.  The
last bit to Silica was easily done on skis and I reached the summit at  2:00
(4100 ft & 5:40 hrs).

The snowshoe tracks of Stefan and Chris continued  to  Pk  5327.  The  ridge
still looked inviting, but I had had enough and had to  think  about  how  I
was going to get down.  I really didn\'t want to return among the ridge.   It
would take much too long. I was on my own now, with no tracks to  follow.  I
knew Stefan\'s plan was to descend from Pk 5327 somehow  to  the  road  along
Evergreen Cr and follow this back to Jack Pass. So  I  opted  for  a  direct
descent off Silica to this same road. I wasn\'t sure how this  would  go  but
it ended up being pretty good.  I had  a  few  hundred  feet  of  reasonable
downhill before being funneled into a steep narrow  gully.  Here  postholing
worked better than skiing through the kneedeep slush. Lower I worked my  way
out of the gully into open forest and more solid snow. I  hit  the  road  at
2900 ft in a little over an hour.

I half expected to come  across  Stefan  and  Chris\'s  tracks  on  the  road
despite their extra peak. They were probably Â½-1 hour ahead of me  and  much
faster. But there were no tracks. I was thankful I had  skis  for  the  long
trek back along the very flat and even partially  uphill  road.  There  were
two washed out stream crossings to contend  with  before  hitting  the  main
road to Evergreen Lookout. The second one probably took a  good  15  minutes
to get across the vertical 5-foot wall on the other side.  The snow  was  so
slushy I had difficulty kicking  any  steps  that  held  up  it.  They  kept
breaking out. I reached the cars at 5:15. I  hung  around  until  Chris  and
Stefan showed up about 30 minutes later.  I was sorry my ski  tracks  hadn\'t
helped them more plodding along that road on snowshoes.

Although snowshoes and skis don\'t ordinarily mix on the  same  trip,  things
worked out well for me this time.  I had the best  of  both  worlds.  I  had
company on the way up Frog, could go at my own pace along the ridge and  not
worry about holding anyone up, tracks to follow all the way  to  Silica  and
the comfort of knowing others were in the area.

El Capitan (5327 ft - 247P - Evergreen Mtn Quad) - February 14, 2007


I always thought San Juan Hill would make a good ski trip  and  so  it  did,
though it would have been even nicer with better snow that would  allow  for
skiing the clearcuts. Since I had already  climbed  San  Juan,  I  added  El
Capitan as the destination for  greater  incentive.  I  also  wanted  to  do
Quarter Dome but it didn\'t happen due to  bad  weather  and  lack  of  time.
Because of snow conditions, I stuck to the road the whole way  to  its  high
point. This was no problem as roads, even long ones, can  be  fun  on  skis.
The lower part was crusty with marginal traction but things improved by  the
first switchback as I climbed to a  dusting  of  fresh  snow  and  I  glided
happily along. I began in fog, but much to my surprise, given  the  horrible
forecast for the day, the weather improved all morning to the point where  I
had reasonable views and could even  see  the  route  I  had  taken  3  days
previously from Frog along the ridge to Silica.

At the road end (4.5 miles, 1800 ft & 2:20 hrs) I put on skins to enter  the
woods.  Here the snow was crusty to downright icy and not really  very  good
for skis. Things got better once I gained the  ridge  with  some  reasonable
skiing up and down along the ridge. Then more unpleasantness  as  I  had  to
make a very steep and once again icy traverse around the cliffs of Pt  4841.
I did run into a line of  old  snowshoe  tracks  (presumably  from  Stefan\'s
recent trip?) that helped. Once back on the  ridge  things  improved  again.
The terrain opened up, there was now 6-8 inches of dry new snow  and  skiing
was a joy as I easily  followed  the  ridge  to  El  Capitan.  However,  the
forecast was now coming true and it was beginning to snow and visibility  to
diminish.  I made the summit before the weather deteriorated  completely  (8
miles, 3600 ft & 5:30 hrs).

I had some delightful skiing off El Capitan. Even  the  traverse  around  Pt
4841 wasn\'t as bad as the new snow began accumulating.  By the  time  I  got
back to the road it was snowing heavily and had  already  put  down  several
inches. In fact there was so much of the sticky new stuff I got  zero  glide
until I stopped to wax my skis. That worked like a charm and  I  zipped  the
rest of the way down the road. Although there was 2 inches or  so  of  slush
on my car, by the time I reached it what was coming down was more like  rain
than snow and very wet.

Total: 16 miles, 4200 ft & 9:30 hrs.

Cle Elum Ridge (3760+ ft - 480P - Teanaway Butte Quad) - February 20, 2007


With recent heavy new snow  over  a  slick  crust  at  the  passes,  I  knew
avalanche danger would be an issue. I thought things might be better to  the
East with less snow. My  original  plan  was  to  ski  Swauk  Ridge  out  of
Liberty.  After crawling  over  Snoqualmie  Pass  with  chains  required,  a
closure for Avy  control  and  almost  blizzard  conditions,  I  arrived  at
Liberty to  sunshine,  no  new  snow  and  not  even  enough  old  snow  for
reasonable  skiing.  I  was  shocked.  I  am  continually  amazed   at   the
inconsistencies of snowfall.  Back to Cle Elum for Plan B, Cle  Elum  Ridge,
where I wandered around for an hour trying to find a viable road to  get  me
close enough to ski it. No luck. Then I tried to access it from Roslyn.   In
all cases I couldn\'t find a way past private roads  and  drives.  I  finally
found a road between Roslyn and Ronald that worked.  With all the delays  it
was after 12:00 before I actually put on the skis.  I started from  a  gated
logging road off plowed roads  of  a  new  development.  Perhaps  eventually
homes will work their way all the way up to the  ridgecrest,  but  for  now,
once under way, the route and ridge are  still  delightful.  I  reached  the
high point in 2 hours then skied along the gentle ridge until I ran  out  of
time. There was  about  1  foot  of  new  snow  along  the  ridge,  but  old
snowmobile tracks made trailbreaking easy most of the  way  until  they  all
headed down to Number 3 Mine near Ronald. Weather alternated  between  heavy
snow squalls and clearing sunbreaks. Despite my late start, this was a  most
enjoyable easy tour, highly recommended with very pleasant skiable terrain.

Total: 11 miles, 1900 ft and 5:30 hrs.

Tarzan Butte (4385 ft - 825P - Teanaway Butte Quad) - February 22, 2007

What a difference two days make. I drove the  speed  limit  (and  over)  the
whole way, with no delays, to the 29 Pines Sno-Park on  the  Teanaway  River
Road. This is mainly a snowmobile lot that accesses the  Teanaway,  but  the
Jungle Cr Road is designated for skiers only  (with  a  voluntary  motorized
closure). There were no snowmobile tracks on that road or on the  spur  road
I took toward Tarzan Butte.  All snowmobiles stayed on the  road  along  Rye
Cr toward Teanaway Butte. Trailbreaking was a bit of work, but  nevertheless
enjoyable. Weather started foggy then cleared to sunbreaks. There  are  many
roads in the area not shown on the map and I took a wrong turn at one  point
but eventually ended up where I wanted to be. I used  skins  for  the  final
climb up the E ridge to the summit. An open area a short ways  down  the  NW
side provided a few views. The new  snow  was  beginning  to  melt  for  the
downhill run but still provided some  quality  turns.  All  in  all  another
pleasant short tour.

Total: 7 miles, 2100 ft and 5 hrs.

Swauk Ridge (4205 ft - 405P - Liberty Quad) - February 27, 2007


I tried this trip last week but there wasn\'t enough new snow  then  to  make
it go, so I tried again this week.  This time  it  worked  although  it  was
harder to get to the ridge than I had anticipated, for a number of  reasons.
I began from Liberty, where a couple of inches of fresh snow over  the  many
snowmobile tracks made skiing up the Lion  Gulch  Road  fast  and  pleasant.
After about a mile I began looking for a way to cut  XC  up  to  the  ridge,
choosing a semi-open area along a side creek. This soon  narrowed  to  creek
bottom where I then took to going straight up a S  facing  slope  where  the
snow cover was decidedly marginal. It was about this time that I  discovered
why my skiing to this point had seemed vaguely unsymmetrical when I  finally
noticed that my skis were mismatched.  I  had  inadvertently  paired  a  fat
160cm Rebound ski on my right foot with a skinnier 170cm Snobound ski on  my
left foot! How in heavens name could  I  have  done  that  without  noticing
right away? I must be losing it. It would have been hilarious  (actually  it
WAS hilarious) if it weren\'t that it  could  potentially  be  a  trip-ending
mistake as this meant I couldn\'t  use  the  skins  I  had  brought  for  the
shorter Rebound skis. Well, I suppose I could have put a skin  on  one  ski,
but I am not sure how well that would have worked. Such are the  hazards  of
having too much gear (who me you say?).  This wouldn\'t have  happened  if  I
had had only one pair of skis to choose from.

I struggled my lopsided way up the thin  snow  cover,  without  the  use  of
skins, eventually making it to the upper road shown on the map.   This  road
didn\'t help that much as it never accessed the ridge itself but I  did  stay
on it until past Pt 3890 where I again went XC to the main  ridge.  Once  on
the ridge the snow was deeper and the skiing very nice.  There  were  a  few
rocky pinnacles to work around but nothing major.  From  the  high  point  I
continued a ways N along the ridge until I found a reasonable slope  to  ski
down. Here is where my mismatched skis really made their differences  clear.
I could turn left  much  more  easily  than  right  and  I  never  made  the
adjustment from one to other properly so the downhill run was not  a  pretty
sight. Once I hit the main road I gave up  on  the  day,  despite  it  still
being early, vowing never to make such a mistake again.

Total: 8 miles, 1800 ft and 5 hrs.

Nelson Hill (4375 ft), Snowshoe Ridge (4125 ft) & Flag  Mtn  (3834  ft)  via
Table Mtn (6200 ft) Loop - Liberty & Swauk Pass Quads - March 1, 2007

This turned into one of my best ski trips of the season, despite one  of  my
worst drives over Snoqualmie Pass. I  had  several  inches  of  snow  in  my
driveway in the morning, Highway 18 over Tiger  Mtn  was  completely  closed
and I had to drive to I-90 a roundabout way via Issaquah,  I-90  itself  had
significant snow all the way from Issaquah to Easton, chains  were  required
over the pass where it was snowing heavily with limited visibility  and  the
plows couldn\'t keep up resulting in rutted tracks and 30 mph speeds. It  was
as bad as I have ever seen it without the pass being closed and  added  1:15
hour to the drive time. Fortunately, traffic was light, many  probably  kept
home by the freak lowland snow. I probably should  have  stayed  home  also,
but I knew if I could just get to where I wanted  to  go,  skiing  would  be
great. It was too.

I began once again from Liberty, this time going up the Cougar  Gulch  Road.
And once again, in contrast to the  miserable  conditions  over  Snoqualmie,
the sun was shining and there was just enough new snow on the road  to  make
skiing nice. This time I made sure my skis were matched, but  I  did  forget
my camera in the car so could take no pictures. Every trip I seem to  either
forget something, lose something, get off  route  or  do  something  equally
stupid to make things more difficult. I have come to accept this as  a  flaw
in my character and  even  enjoy  the  challenge  of  figuring  out  how  to
persevere in spite of my errors. However, I do regret forgetting  my  camera
on this beautiful day.

About a mile up Cougar Gulch  I  turned  right  onto  Williams  Creek  Road.
Although no longer groomed, a snowmobile had  been  up  this  road  recently
enough that it made trailbreaking no problem.  I  followed  the  old  track,
putting on skins when it steepened, to Nelson Hill (1700 ft, 2 hrs)  and  on
as it continued up the ridge. I had hoped the track would lead  me  all  the
way to Table Mtn, but this was not the case.  It  began  contouring  N  away
from where I wanted to go, so at about 5000 ft I left the track to head  SE.
Here trailbreaking became more work through the now over  a  foot  of  fresh
snow. I worked my way past a rocky  point  up  steep  slopes  and  contoured
below the fascinating cliffs of Table Mtn near Pt  5885  to  eventually  hit
the main Table Mtn Road at about 6000 ft (3500 ft, 4:20 hrs).

I followed this road about 2 miles, over a high  point  of  6200  ft,  to  a
saddle where I could drop  off  the  ridge.  After  a  short  windblown  icy
section the ski down to pick up Snowshoe Ridge was to die for - the kind  of
deep forgiving powder where you could do no wrong. All too soon it ended  as
I followed a narrow track down Snowshoe Ridge, but  the  snow  was  so  good
even this skiing was easy and fun and fast. Soon the track hit a  road  with
fresh snowmobile tracks, which I followed to Snowshoe Ridge proper.  Next  I
wanted to ski to Flag Mtn. I thought this would all be on  easy  road.   Not
so. Most of the way was on an old track that  was  blocked  to  snowmobiles.
So I had more trailbreaking, some of it up and my  skis  were  not  climbing
well, (I didn\'t take the time to put skins back on)  or  maybe  I  was  just
getting tired. Then the summit of Flag (4100  ft,  7  hrs)  was  a  surprise
rocky little scramble. All this took longer than expected. I  thought  about
skiing directly off Flag to a road below but in the end decided it  was  too
steep, the snow cover  too  thin  and  the  terrain  too  uncertain  and  so
reversed my track to the main road. The fast run down the groomed road  made
up for lost time and I still made the car before dark, though just barely.

The drive home over Snoqualmie Pass in the evening bore  no  resemblance  at
all to my morning one. The road was bare and  dry  the  whole  way  with  no
evidence at all of the storm that had hit a short time earlier. How  quickly
conditions can change!

Total: 16 miles, 4200 ft and 8 hrs.

Jolly Mtn (6443 ft - 963P - Davis Pk Quad) - March 6, 2007


Yes, I know.  I was just up much of Jolly Mtn  on  Saturday,  March  3  with
Jim, Eileen and Beth. But we didn\'t make the top  (not  that  is  seemed  to
matter much at the time) and I so like this trip that  when  Tuesday  dawned
an A+ sunny warm day, I found myself inexplicably headed back  to  the  same
place. I just wanted a sure thing with known conditions  and  high  mountain
views to take full advantage of the exemplary weather. And did  I  ever.  In
addition, since neither my companions, route nor snow  conditions  were  the
same as Saturday, it really ended up being an entirely different trip.

I had thought to make use of the track we had set up the road  on  Saturday,
but the road to begin was so crusty I needed skins right away.  Skinning  up
a gentle road is something I usually avoid,  so  I  left  it  at  the  first
switchback and went straight uphill all the way to Sasse  Ridge  (2.8  mile,
2800 ft, 2:20 hrs). I passed below our previous high  point  in  another  45
minutes and began the longer-than-it-looks up and down traverse to the  5960
ft saddle N of Jolly. Despite a supposedly 8000 ft freezing level,  anything
in the shade or not fully exposed to the  sun  remained  crusty,  especially
the last 500 foot climb up the N ridge to the summit (5.5  miles,  4300  ft,
4:30 hrs).

Views were to die for, which was of course why I  was  there  in  the  first
place, and I went crazy snapping pictures. I  felt  on  top  of  the  world.
While I took a short break for lunch, a hawk soared overhead  to  check  out
this anomalous creature. He circled half a dozen times as if to say, "  See!
I can fly higher than you can!" True enough, but  I  felt  pretty  satisfied
with my own height!

The ski down the N ridge was still crusty, but anything in  the  direct  sun
had turned to deep heavy slush. I managed to cut two of the  switchbacks  on
the main road before my knees began to complain and  my  telemark  technique
to suffer accordingly. I finished the day content to  follow  the  road  the
rest of the way down and was most thankful  for  the  previous  track  so  I
didn\'t have to break trail downhill, reaching the car well before dark.

My improved time over Saturday was not due to  my  moving  any  faster,  but
rather to the shorter distance cutting straight uphill (I shaved off a  good
3 miles going this way), better snow for climbing and to  taking  only  very
short breaks. Comparing the two  trips,  I  much  prefer  the  laughter  and
company of good friends, but this one came in a close second.

Total: 13.6 miles, 4500 ft and 7:45 hrs.

Red Mtn (5880+ ft - 2560P - Polallie Ridge Quad) - March 9, 2007


I have Jim Brisbine to thank for suggesting skiing up the north side of  Red
Mtn.  I would never have thought to try that as it  had  always  seemed  too
steep to me for skiing and really  more  suited  to  snowshoes.   But  while
skiing up Jolly Mtn recently, with a great view of Red  across  the  valley,
Jim pointed out a series of clearcuts and a  traversing  road  half  way  up
that clearly offered possibilities and confessed his hope to some  day  give
it a go. I must apologize to Jim for stealing  his  idea  and  running  away
with it, but I am an impatient by nature and once an idea enters my  head  I
am compelled to act upon it as quickly as possible.

Now the first question was how to get to the  road  we  saw  without  skiing
miles with snowmobiles. It appeared that it  should  be  accessible  from  a
clearcut very near the Cooper River Rd bridge over the Cle Elum  River,  but
as I skied  up  this  groomed  snowmobile  route  I  saw  no  side  road  or
reasonable XC route in this area. My map did show a road going  uphill  some
3 miles farther on, a route I had hoped to avoid, but now I was  stuck  with
it. Somehow I didn\'t go quite far enough, missed the road I wanted and  took
another, not shown on my map, that started up a  clearcut.  It  soon  became
obvious I wasn\'t on the right road, but rather than retreat, I went with  my
mistake skinning straight up the steep slopes. Soon I could see the  road  I
had wanted across a deep ravine but I couldn\'t get to it at that  point.  So
I just continued up until I eventually intersected  the  traversing  road  I
had originally wanted.

The second question was what to do now that I was on the road.  It  appeared
to traverse into the drainage between Red Mtn and the West Pk of  Red  where
I didn\'t think it would be that helpful as a route to the  summit.  However,
a spur continued uphill to another clearcut below Red\'s NE  ridge  and  this
looked promising. Not only was it promising, it  was  positively  delightful
as a ski route.  After a short wooded section at the top of the clearcut,  I
gained access to the ridge itself and then a  series  of  open  slopes,  all
very skiable. I would never have  guessed  this  looking  at  the  map.  The
summit itself was a corniced ridge (5.2 miles, 3700 ft,  4:45  hrs).  I  had
thought to continue to the West Pk but the  ridge  looked  difficult  and  I
doubted I had enough time.  The West Pk  would  have  to  wait  for  another
trip.

Climbing up the first clearcut I went through a very slushy snow  transition
zone before gradually getting to firmer snow  higher  up.  Near  the  summit
there was 4-5 inches of fresh snow over a crusty base, with  the  new  stuff
turning wet fast.  Not perfect conditions for downhill, but not bad  either,
and I managed a reasonable run off the summit. It was tempting  to  continue
down very inviting terrain into the NE basin, but  this  appeared  from  the
map to end in a steep narrow ravine. I was afraid to try it  without  having
come up that way. Instead, I went straight down as far as I dared  and  then
traversed back to the NE ridge and my up route.

Once back on the traversing road at 4000 ft, I  continued  following  it  SW
hoping to find a better way down to the valley. After  about  1.5  miles  of
flat trailbreaking, I came to the edge of the clearcut  I  had  seen  almost
directly above the Cle  Elum  River  Bridge.  But  I  found  no  road  going
downhill. Rather, at this point the road went  uphill  and  I  found  myself
stranded at a dead-end 1300 ft above the valley. To make  matters  worse,  I
couldn\'t ski down the clearcut without climbing up past a  deep  ravine.   I
was forced to ski down steep forest. Actually it wasn\'t as bad as I  thought
it would be.  The snow was very soft and the trees far apart. Still  it  was
a rather challenging trip down. I hit the groomed road  about  a  mile  from
the car.

The irony of this trip is that the road that Jim and I had  spotted  halfway
up Red was really of no practical use. Still it did  lure  me  to  the  peak
where I discovered some fabulous ski terrain. It will warrant  future  trips
and exploration. Total: 11 miles, 3700 ft and 7:30 hrs.


Red Mtn, West Pk (5480+ ft - 400P - Polallie Ridge Quad) - March 13, 2007


It only took until the following Tuesday for me to get back to the West  Pk.
I did say I am an impatient person. This  time  I  found  the  correct  road
uphill .4 miles farther on from where I went uphill  last  time  (3.4  miles
total from the car). This  made  climbing  much  easier,  although  I  still
needed skins as the snow was very crusty despite a  mostly  sunny  start  to
the day. I followed the road another 4 miles  to  the  vast  clearcut  basin
between Red Mtn and the West Peak.

After my last few trips out  where  the  snow  had  become  very  slushy,  I
expected it to quickly soften. Instead  the  snow  level  appeared  to  have
taken a nose dive on me and temperatures remained  below  freezing  all  day
above 3000 ft. Eventually it dawned  on  me  that  the  snow  would  not  be
softening at all this day and I would have to content with  nasty  crust  on
the downhill. It was not going to be a stellar ski day. I  even  had  doubts
as to whether I would make my summit, by any means. Where I  left  the  road
to gain the ridge to the West Pk, the  snow  was  downright  icy.  Then  the
summit itself was steeper and more challenging than I had  expected.  I  was
able to keep skis on to reach the summit  ridge  on  the  north  but  I  was
unable to follow it directly to the top. I was forced onto a steep  traverse
across the east face to gain the ridge from the south.  And  me  without  an
ice axe. I didn\'t think I would need one.  Looking at the map I  thought  it
would be an easy ski ascent. If the  slope  had  been  really  icy,  I  most
likely would have turned around at this point. Fortunately,  the  slope  was
in the sun and had softened enough  that  I  could  kick  reasonable  steps.
Still, it was unnerving to cross with just ski poles. I reached  the  summit
at 2:45 (3500 ft, 5 hrs).

I did more walking than skiing getting back to the road.  What  a  shame  as
the terrain would make great  skiing  with  even  reasonable  snow.  I  even
expected the road ski to be a disaster and I really wasn\'t  looking  forward
to 7 miles of plodding. But much to my surprise the road  was  a  great  ski
down, partially because it was not steep, partially because it  was  groomed
and smooth and partially because it did softened up a little in the sun.  So
it wasn\'t a total bust as a ski trip. Total: 16.4 miles, 3600 ft and 8 hrs.

Flapjack Point (5191 ft - 471P - Evergreen Mtn Quad) - March 20, 2007


Snow advisories for the mountains caused the cancellation of more  ambitious
climbing plans, so I went skiing  instead  and  I  wasn\'t  really  all  that
unhappy.  Did  I  ever  mention  before  that  I  love  backcountry  skiing,
especially up a new peak, especially in new snow? Although I  must  say  the
new snow was almost too much of a good thing.  It  snowed  heavily  all  day
long racking up a good  18  inches  total  that  completely  obliterated  my
uphill tracks  on  the  approach  road  so  not  only  did  I  have  serious
trailbreaking on the way in, I had to do it all over again on the  way  out.
Was this really the first day of spring?  Maybe  it  was  the  last  day  of
winter.

I drove as far as I could on road 6514  (Eagle  Cr  Road)  off  the  Beckler
River Road until stopped by a fallen  tree  at  1900  ft.  I  couldn\'t  have
gotten much farther anyway, as a patch of old  snow  was  just  beyond.  The
snow level had just started its plunge downward, the rain quickly turned  to
heavy snowfall and just as quickly beginning  sticking  to  the  bare  road.
Good thing, as the first mile had many bare sections  that  were  made  just
barely skiable.  As I climbed the new snow became deeper  and  deeper  until
by the time I crossed Eagle Cr at 3.5 miles, elev 3240  ft,  I  was  plowing
through 6 inches and more. The main road continued depressingly flat, so  as
soon as possible I put on skins and went  straight  uphill  through  an  old
clearcut even though the  second  growth  trees  were  discouragingly  close
together. When I hit an upper spur (elev 3600 ft), I headed left  into  open
woods that offered better travel, not to mention less fresh  snow  to  break
trail through. It was fairly steep to start, but as I climbed  the  gradient
gentled and the going was very pleasant.

I broke out of the trees at a saddle (elev 4600 ft) and  was  treated  to  a
brief (like 30 seconds) moment of clearing with almost sun and  almost  blue
sky, the only of the day. In the open now, and higher,  the  deep  new  snow
really slowed me down and I took about an hour to go the last  600  ft.  The
summit ridge and summit itself made for a  very  nice  ski  ascent,  but  of
course I had no views.  I am sure they would be very nice when visible.

The snow was a tad too deep for  elegant  skiing  off  the  summit  but  the
skiing down through the forest was delightful. Then I hit the road.   I  had
hoped to pick up two more peaks in the area  but  those  hopes  were  dashed
when I came to the realization that it had snowed so much while  I  was  out
my uphill tracks were gone and of no use. Not only would I not be doing  any
more uphill I would have to work just to go down. There are few things  more
disheartening than having to break trail downhill on skis.  After  all,  the
whole point of skiing is the free downhill run. But I am not complaining.  I
still had a great trip and I am happy any time I have skis on my feet.

Total: 11 miles, 3900 ft and 8:40 hrs.

I had thought to return to Eagle Cr and pick up the two peaks  I  missed  on
Tuesday, but somehow a predicted snow level of 3000 ft changed overnight  to
4500 ft. Since both peaks were right  around  4500  ft  high  and  I  didn\'t
relish spending the entire day in the rain, I just  kept  going  to  Stevens
Pass where it was 33 degrees and snowing. I hoped I would  get  high  enough
to get into some of the beautiful new snow I had run into two  days  earlier
but it was not to be. The snow level may have been 4500 ft but  the  melting
level was much higher and all that gorgeous  snow  was  already  turning  to
foot deep slush and just got wetter and wetter and heavier  and  heavier  as
the day went on.

I started in skins right away up the steep cat track that ended at a  tower,
then traversed on an old ski trail to Skyline Ridge and followed the  ridge,
more or less, to the summit of Sky Mtn. I have been up Sky before but I  was
so close I couldn\'t resist a  repeat  visit.  In  virgin  territory  now,  I
descended in reasonable conditions 1000 ft, past Tye Lake, to  the  4360  ft
saddle between Tye and Spinnaker. The snow was now so sticky I was  able  to
climb from there without reapplying skins all the  way  to  Spinnaker  (4.75
mile, 3200 ft, 5 hrs). The ridge was easy skiing and since I had the time  I
continued on to the Martin BM, Â½ mile farther.

The terrain off the ridge back to the saddle was good for  skiing,  but  the
snow was now so wet and heavy, that it took all the leg muscle I had  to  be
able to turn in it. And it was a very good lesson in keeping  weight  evenly
distributed over both skis. If I got too much weight over the front ski,  it
would dive deeply into the snow becoming completely buried and down I  would
go. Such is the life of  a  backcountry  skier  in  the  Pacific  Northwest.
Conditions are rarely ideal, with the snow level jumping up and down like  a
yoyo, and one must learn to ski the crude (or at least survive it)  or  stay
home 90% of the time.

At the saddle, the prospect of breaking trail 1000 ft up  to  Skyline  Ridge
was more than I could bear. Even going downhill had about done me in. I  saw
I was very close to the PCT and I naively thought I could just pick  up  the
trail and follow it, seemingly mostly downhill or  level,  back  to  Stevens
Pass. This turned out to be more difficult than I had imagined.  I  couldn\'t
find any trace of the trail and there were no signs of  anyone  having  been
in the area since the last storm. I wandered up and down through  woods  and
meadows and across steep slopes breaking trail through exhausting slush.  To
make matters worse, whatever precipitation coming down  now  was  closer  to
rain than snow and I was beginning to get very wet.  I  finally  ran  across
the trail about 1.5 miles from the pass, but  it  took  another  Â½  mile  of
trailbreaking before I found any helpful fresh tracks. Total it had taken  2
Â½ hours to get out the 3 miles from the saddle.

Total: 10.1 miles, 4350 ft and 10 hrs.

Peak 5495 (415P - Blowout Mtn Quad) - April 5, 2007


This was my second attempt on this peak. During the first one, on March  16,
I was thwarted by discovering that the snowmobile bridge over Cabin  Cr  was
gone (it was there last year), evidently washed away  by  the  fall  floods,
which made my planned approach via the roads  along  Cabin  and  Log  Creeks
impossible. In a futile attempt to find an alternate  way,  I  followed  the
groomed route up Cole Cr (not knowing where it went) in the hopes  it  would
lead where I wanted to go.  It would  have,  eventually,  by  climbing  high
around the N end of Cole Butte then descending 1200 ft  to  Log  Cr.  But  I
didn\'t have the time or energy to pursue it and instead salvaged the day  by
staying high and making a loop over Pt 5230 and in the  process  discovering
some new clearcuts with marvelous skiing.

I returned three weeks later with more time and  energy  for  a  route  over
Cole Butte ridge which would involve an  additional  2400  ft  of  elevation
gain over the original plan. The Sno-Park  (elev  2200  ft)  was  no  longer
officially open (all signs and  the  porta-potty  removed),  but  there  was
still snow at the start although  it  was  getting  thin  with  a  few  bare
patches. All went well until I turned off the groomed road and discovered  a
huge cat had  gone  up  my  road  leaving  horrid  deep  rutted  tracks  and
completely destroying it for skiing. In places the  twin  tracks  were  2.5-3
feet deep. Had I known I was going to have to contend with such a  disaster,
I might very well have  considered  going  elsewhere.   But  they  were  not
noticeable on the groomed road so it was too late by the  time  I  ran  into
them to do anything else.

Thankfully, the cat tracks turned off my route onto a side  road  after  2.2
miles and 1200 ft. I have no idea why this  cat  was  traveling  up  a  snow
covered road. It is not like it was  plowing  the  road.  Maybe  the  Forest
Service was doing an early check of a timber sale. If so, why couldn\'t  they
have gone by snowmobile?  It certainly would have been  easier  and  cheaper
not to mention made  it  better  for  me  to  ski.  By  the  way,  even  the
snowmobiles seemed to have had trouble getting up the cat tracks.

I continued on the now trackless road in bliss until leaving it to climb  up
the large clearcut to the 5200 ft saddle on Cole Butte ridge. I now  had  to
drop 1200 ft to the 4000 ft saddle between Log Creek and Big  Creek.  I  had
hoped to ski  straight  down,  but  steep  terrain,  thick  trees  and  snow
conditions made it easier to stick to the road. From the low saddle  another
road led easily to the final open wooded slopes and the summit  of  Pk  5495
(11 miles, 4700 ft, 6 hrs).

I had a pleasant lunch in the sun before beginning the long trek  back.  The
ski off the summit and down the road was fast and  fun  until  I  was  faced
with the 1200 ft climb back up to Cole Butte ridge. I put on skins and  went
straight uphill rather than follow the long road hoping it would  save  time
and energy. I don\'t think it did.  By the time I topped  out  I  was  pretty
much done in and it was all I could do to ski decently down the clearcut  on
the other side. And then I came to the dreaded cat track. It was as  bad  as
I had imagined. I could ski neither the deep track nor the narrow middle in-
between.  That left me with the downhill edge of  the  road,  which  worked,
sort of, most of the time. But it was a real challenge.  This  is  about  as
bad as it gets for road skiing. However, the snow was soft, so  I  guess  it
would have been worse if it had  been  icy.   In  that  case  I  would  most
certainly have been walking down.

Total: 21 miles, 6150 ft and 11 hrs.

Pk 4534 (574P - Baring Quad) and Pk 4494 (774P - Evergreen Mtn Quad) -
April 7, 2007

These are two peaks I had my eye on but didn\'t have time for  when  I  skied
up Flapjack Point a couple of weeks ago. This  time  I  was  able  to  drive
about a mile farther up Eagle Cr Road (6514) to 2100 ft. Another .3 mile  of
walking brought me to enough consistent snow  for  skiing.  I  followed  the
road for 3 miles to where I could easily leave it to climb up  onto  the  SE
ridge of Pk 4534. Although much of the ridge was in forest it  was  pleasant
skiing and there were many fantastic views of Baring, Merchant and  Townsend
along the way. An open spot just before the wooded true summit  made  for  a
lovely lunch break (4.5 miles, 2400 ft, 3 hrs).

For the return I stayed high on the ridge, going over a 3960  ft  knoll  for
more good views, and made a long horseshoe traverse, quite steep in  places,
around a side valley of Eagle Creek until I  could  climb  up  onto  the  NW
ridge of Pk 4494. I then followed this  wooded  ridge  to  the  summit  (9.6
miles, 3900 ft, 6 hrs). I picked up a road on  the  other  side,  cutting  a
switchback through a clearcut with excellent skiing, and  followed  it  back
to the main road to close my loop trip.

I highly recommend this area for ski touring. It doesn\'t seem to be  heavily
used (although I did see evidence of some snowmobile use),  the  terrain  is
friendly for skiing with multiple destinations possible and in good  weather
the views are fantastic.

Total: 13.8 miles, 3900 ft and 8 hrs.

Quarterdome (5276 ft - 596P - Evergreen Mtn Quad) - April 10, 2007


I knew it was going to be a long hard day when I arrived  at  Jack  Pass  to
over 5 inches of fresh wet snow with more  coming  down.  Trailbreaking  was
definitely going to  take  its  toll.  By  the  time  I  got  to  the  first
switchback on the main road up San Juan Hill I began looking  for  a  faster
way uphill. To this end, I went straight on a spur road looking to  skin  up
a clearcut to the ridge above. But I  hadn\'t  counted  on  this  spur  being
decommissioned and the culverts being removed (or  washed  out).  The  first
two creek crossings were fairly easily bypassed but the third and  main  one
was a deep chasm that took me a good half hour to find a  way  across.  Once
past this, easy clearcuts and open forest led to the main ridge of San  Juan
Hill.

After a short pleasant ski along the ridge to a 4400 ft  saddle,  I  dropped
off the ridge down steep slopes to 3900 ft and the  open  meadows  of  upper
San Juan Cr and then tried to work my way toward the  4640  ft  El  Capitan-
Quarterdome saddle. I actually traversed  too  far,  completely  missed  the
saddle and found myself  on  the  quite  steep  SE  slopes  of  Quarterdome.
Although there were brief periods of clearing and even  sun  at  times,  for
the most part it was foggy and snowing with little visibility  most  of  the
day. I topped out on the summit, with no views, at 3:10 (3500 ft, 6:10 hr).

Seeking to avoid my uphill error, I  skied  down  the  S  ridge  to  the  El
Capitan-Quarterdome saddle (much better ski terrain) and then took  as  high
a traverse as possible under the cliffs of Pt 4841 around San Juan Cr  basin
and back to San Juan ridge saving  a  little  elevation  gain.  I  had  some
lovely skiing down through open forest and clearcuts until the  snow  became
so deep and wet and heavy that turning was a chore. I chose  a  route  so  I
didn\'t have to repeat the tough creek crossing of the way up,  but  I  still
had to contend with difficult skiing through close trees below the  clearcut
before hitting the spur road. My tracks on the main road were mostly  snowed
in but I thankfully still got a little glide for the last bit  back  to  the
car.

Total: 12 miles, 4100 ft and 10:20 hrs.

D Mtn (5409 ft - 729P) and Valhalla Mtn (5200+ ft - 160P)  -  Captain  Point
Quad - April 13, 2007

I was able to drive about .3 mile beyond the Iron Goat TH (elev 2600 ft)  on
Martin Cr Rd 6710. Continuous skiable snow started right  from  the  car.  I
followed the road  to  the  upper  valley,  across  Martin  Cr  and  up  two
switchbacks to the 4640 ft saddle with Captain Point (5.7  miles,  2200  ft,
3:30 hrs), where there were several inches of fresh  snow  and  more  coming
down. From the saddle I skied up the gentle and pleasant S  ridge,  half  in
clearcut and half in open woods, to the summit of D  Mtn  (6.7  miles,  3000
ft, 4:30 hrs). Much to my surprise I found the register stuffed  in  a  tree
hole by Stefan on 2/10/07. He had ascended from the north over Valhalla.

I descended 400 ft and easily followed the  ridge  NE  to  Valhalla  Mtn  (8
miles, 3200 ft, 5:30 hrs). I found no register here although I  know  Stefan
also climbed this peak on the same day as D. The snow level  was  noticeably
rising, the precipitation was turning to rain  and  the  snow  was  becoming
slushy. Despite that, this made for a very enjoyable,  relatively  easy,  if
somewhat long, ski tour.

Total: 15.8 miles, 3300 ft and 8:45 hrs.

Thatsit Pk (5498 ft - 458P - Captain Point Quad) - April 17, 2007

While climbing D Mtn I made plans to return and give Thatsit  Pk  a  try  by
possibly going high on Captain Point and contouring above  Kelley  Cr  to  a
saddle on the N ridge. Then  I  noticed  another  possible  route  from  the
Beckler River Rd and Johnson Cr Rd 6520 that appeared  to  go  through  much
more appealing and ski friendly terrain on the N side of  Mt  Fernow,  if  I
could just get to it. My map showed an old spur road  going  up  Johnson  Cr
that might work. I was able to drive within .3 mile of this  spur  but  upon
reaching it I discovered that it was very old indeed and very overgrown  and
with the low snowcover at this elevation was not really  skiable.  Still,  I
perservered, half skiing, half walking, pestered by annoying  brush  covered
with fresh wet snow, until I gradually hit more consistent  snow  and  could
head straight uphill to a higher road

This upper road was blessedly skiable and I blissfully followed  it  a  flat
1.5 miles to its end in a clearcut. From here an easy  contour  led  to  the
lovely Mt Fernow Potholes and inviting open terrain below the cliffs  of  Mt
Fernow which made all  my  earlier  struggles  with  brush  well  worth  the
effort. I gleefully skied up easy (except for one short steep  step)  slopes
to the 5000 ft saddle on the S ridge of Thatsit.   More  good  skiing  along
the ridge and I was on the summit at 2:00  (3200  ft,  5:10  hrs).  My  only
regret was that the variable mostly snowy and foggy weather  did  not  allow
for any good views of the rocky N face of Mt Fernow.

The ski back was all pleasant until I had to descend off the upper  road  to
the brushy spur road below. I thought maybe I could just stay on  the  upper
road. Eventually it would connect with the main Johnsen Cr Rd,  but  looking
at my map it wandered level forever and would take me miles out of  my  way.
So I bit the bullet and dropped off the upper road at a point where I  could
just go down the fall-line. I was initially able to ski a few  hundred  feet
before giving it up as  a  lost  cause,  taking  off  my  skis  and  booting
downhill through the brush. It was actually better and less brushy  than  my
uphill route and I came out very close to the junction with the main road.

Total: 10.5 miles, 3450 ft and 9 hrs.

Labyrinth Mtn Quad - April 19, 2007

A strange mix of winter and spring weather of late keeps extending  the  ski
season for me. Continuing low snow levels for this time of  year  and  fresh
snow conspire to lure me out on skis for "one last trip" before  turning  to
climbing. Add longer daylight and mostly better than  expected  weather  and
my thoughts turn to routes I wouldn\'t dare try during  winter.  This  day  I
ran into a couple inches fresh snow going over Stevens Pass with a bit  less
at my start at Smith Brook Road.

I stayed on the road most of the way to 4600 ft  Nason  Saddle  (3.4  miles,
1500 ft, 2 hrs), only cutting the final switchback even  though  this  meant
putting on skins because of the hard crust under  the  fresh  dusting.  From
the saddle I went slightly  right  up  through  surprisingly  pleasant  open
woods to the summit of Nason1 (2500 ft, 3  hrs).  No  difficulties  to  this
point. But I also wanted to continue on to Nason2 and I knew this  could  be
a problem or even impossible. Looking at the map there were several  suspect
areas where close contours might mean  cliffs.  But  you  never  know  until
seeing it firsthand.  I have found perfectly reasonable  routes  where  maps
indicated cliffs. Conversely, I have had great difficulty where  nothing  at
all showed on a map. Maybe I would get lucky.

I did not get lucky. From the  summit  of  Nason1  I  could  see  the  ridge
leading east was all rocky  and  pinnacled  and  not  at  all  feasible.  In
particular Pt 5406 would be difficult to get around. I almost gave it up  as
a bad idea right there on the summit. But it was much too early in  the  day
to go home. And so I started down off the summit. I backtracked  west  to  a
point where I could ski NE off the ridge and did  okay  until  coming  to  a
steep step I couldn\'t handle on skis. Off they  came  as  I  booted  down  a
narrow gully to a lower basin.  Then thinking I was below the cliffs  of  Pt
5406, I traversed too high hoping to save elevation  and  got  cliffed  out.
Retreat and backtrack. Down another steep gully  on  foot  until  I  finally
reached a reasonable traverse line at 4600 ft. All this had taken 1.5  hours.
Any more difficulties and I would be running out of time.

Fortunately, there were no more problems. I  climbed  up  to  cross  a  spur
ridge at 5120 ft and then did a mostly level traverse to the 5160 ft  saddle
on the S ridge of Nason2. The skiing was surprising good  as  was  the  snow
which was several inches of mostly lovely powder preserved by being on  a  N
slope. The final bit to the summit of Nason2 (3500  ft,  5:45  hrs)  was  on
open slopes softening in the full sun with the  gorgeous  backdrop  of  Rock
Mtn filling the view.

I avoided all cliffs on the way back by staying low  and  going  farther  to
the right (N) but it was still very steep and I still had to climb  1000  ft
almost to the summit of Nason1 again. And I had to  put  on  skins  for  the
third time.  Good thing I had recently reglued them or the wet soggy  things
wouldn\'t have stuck to my skis. I had a reasonable ski  down  to  the  road.
Softening snow helped.  But it made for a sobering realization  skiing  down
the road. I am aware that the upper Smith Brook Rd is known as an  avalanche
area. I found this to be true first hand. Snow  on  the  very  steep  slopes
above the  road  softened  to  liquid  slush  in  the  direct  sunlight  had
avalanched over my uphill tracks. And it was  still  unstable.  I  left  the
road and retreated down through the trees but I still set off  small  sluffs
of my own in the extremely wet foot deep mush. I didn\'t much care for  that.
Once on the lower road  the  snow  was  beginning  to  freeze  again  and  I
rocketed the last few miles to the car.

Total: 13 miles, 4600 ft and 9:15 hrs.

I have a whole list of peaks yet to do along Highway 2, and  I  had  several
in mind this day, but the rain kept me driving until I found myself back  at
Smith Brook Road east of Stevens Pass where I  was  just  last  week  skiing
Nason Ridge 1&2. I was hoping for better conditions here  and  at  first  it
appeared I would have them. There was even a brief sun  break  or  two.  But
that didn\'t last long and the weather gradually deteriorated throughout  the
day.

It was fairly mild and with the cloud cover the snow was  soft  even  at  my
relatively early 8 am start. It would only get softer. To avoid a repeat  of
my scare of last week with the avalanche, I  completely  avoided  the  upper
road and went straight uphill at the first switchback through  steep  forest
directly to Nason Pass (2.4 miles, 1400 ft, 1:40 hrs). This saved some  time
and distance if not effort. Now  began  a  heartbreaking  1000-foot  descent
into the Rainy Cr valley. I gained some solace by  the  excellent  downhill,
the best of the day, through the clearcut to the road below.  But  this  was
followed by 2.4 miles of maddeningly flat road to the Minotaur Lake TH  (5.4
miles, 1650 ft, 3 hrs).

I left the road just past the TH on  the  other  side  of  the  lake  outlet
creek. The steep open woods and initial hard snow were very unappealing  for
skis so I carried them to about 4400 ft where the gradient lessened and  the
snow improved. The rest of the way  to  the  summit  of  Labyrinth3  was  no
problem on skis (6.3 miles, 3700 ft, 5 hrs). It was now snowing and  blowing
and views left something to be desired. I never got any good ones of  either
Labyrinth Mtn, Rock Mtn or Nason Ridge.

I skied back to the saddle with Aegeus and  easily  up  the  ridge  to  that
summit (7.9 miles, 4550 ft, 6:40 hrs). At this point I probably should  have
skied down my up route, but I really wanted to continue on to Minotaur  Lake
and so I did. The skiing was good to the lake and down  the  first  part  of
the trail. Then I got into a mess of close scrub  trees  and  steep  terrain
above the outlet creek gully with  very  slushy  snow  that  made  for  slow
going. It had also begun to rain. As soon  as  I  got  to  open  forest  and
harder snow I took off the skis and walked the rest of the way to the road.

The flat road looked pretty good to me now and with my earlier track set  in
the slush made for pretty pleasant gliding. A final climb  up  the  clearcut
to Nason Pass (12.9  miles,  5550  ft,  10:20  hrs)  and  then  it  was  all
downhill, though in a steady rain, the rest of the way out.

Total: 15.6 miles, 5600 ft and 11:25 hrs

Cascade Mtn (5591 ft - 1031P) and Mile High Mtn (5280+ ft - 1120P) -
Snoqualmie Lk Quad - April 29-30

I have been hard pressed to find two days in a row lately without  at  least
some rain in the forecast, and I really didn\'t want to try  these  peaks  in
bad weather. I also felt I couldn\'t do them in one day and needed a camp  at
Dream Lake. So when Sunday afternoon and all day Monday  were  predicted  to
be sunny I figured I  had  my  two  days.  Turns  out  the  forecast  wasn\'t
entirely correct, but it was good enough.

Sunday started out cloudy with a little drizzle as I started up  the  Taylor
River Trail on my bike. Bikes are allowed as far as the Snoqualmie Lake  TH,
but the old road is rapidly deteriorating and I found the  bike  more  of  a
hindrance than a help, as least with an overnight pack. Although  there  are
sections that are very rideable, much of the way is also  rough  and  rocky,
there are numerous washouts and creek crossings  and  several  downed  trees
that have not yet been cleared this year. So when I came to a  rockslide  at
3.25 miles, I had enough, stashed the bike and continued on foot. From  that
point on things only got worse with more washouts, more downed trees  and  a
particularly large blowndown that even the burliest guy would  have  trouble
getting his bike over.

Just before the bridge over Big Cr, elev 1720 ft,  (4.5  miles,  700  ft,  2
hrs), I left the trail and headed uphill to Dream Lake. Dream Lake may be  a
"dream" as a lake but the route  to  it  is  no  "dream"  but  more  like  a
nightmare. It started out well enough in  reasonable  forest  but  that  all
ended at a large basin filled with horrid brush  at  2500  ft.  I  tried  to
avoid it by traversing uphill into what I thought was forest  but  it  ended
up being thick scrub cedar that was even worse than the brush. When  I  came
to an impassible ravine, I had to descend to the basin anyway  having  taken
an hour for a net gain of 1/10 mile.  I  crashed  brush  in  the  basin  for
another hour, found a way across the rushing creek,  much  smaller  at  this
point, and climbed a rib until the way improved when I  hit  solid  snowpack
above about 3100 ft.  I found a level campsite right by the outlet creek  of
Dream Lake at 4:00, elev 3450 ft (6 miles, 2800 ft, 6 hrs.).  It  had  taken
me 4 hrs to go a distance of about 1.5 miles from the trail.

I quickly set up camp and left for Mile High Mtn at 5:00.  I  knew  I  would
have to get lucky  to  make  the  summit  in  the  time  left  before  dark,
especially since I had no clear idea of where  to  go  as  I  could  see  no
obvious route on the map. The mountain has defenses  on  all  sides.  I  saw
several possible routes but they all had close contours at some  point  that
could indicate impassible cliffs. I would just have to go and see. My  first
choice was a gully system on the west side that led directly to the  summit,
but contours indicated a possible cliff band at 4600  ft.  I  climbed  above
Pothole Lake, and just kept traversing open slopes past my  supposed  gully,
seeing only cliffs above, until I ended up on the  SW  ridge,  which  turned
out to be impassible. I turned around at 7:20 and 5050 ft and  was  back  in
camp by 8:30 (1700 ft, 3:30 hrs). The snow had become  very  slushy  in  the
afternoon sun. The next morning it was frozen hard.

Dream Lake is surrounded by cliffs and the hardest  part  of  the  route  up
Cascade Mtn was finding a way up these cliffs to a large basin SW  of  Smith
Lake. I had a good view from Mile High and chose a snow  gully  that  seemed
like it would work. But first I had to get to it by going around  the  lake.
At the base of the gully was a large deposition of avalanche snow  that  had
spilled into the lake. I made the mistaken assumption that  this  was  solid
and used it to cross the edge of the lake to avoid  a  steep  slope.  I  was
shocked when a misstep between piles of snow  tuned  out  to  be  less  than
stable and my right foot went into water up to my knee.  I  will  state  the
obvious and say that Gore-Tex boots are not  waterproof  if  you  step  into
water over their top and for the rest of the trip my  right  foot  was  cold
and wet. But I will also say I was lucky that the rest of me  didn\'t  follow
my foot into the lake. My climb was almost over before it began.

I donned crampons and climbed the gully for several  hundred  feet  until  I
could exit right onto a rib. I continued up this to about 4200  ft  until  I
could cross another smaller gully then traverse a bit and  descend  slightly
into the large basin. I climbed up alongside avalanche debris to Smith  Lake
and from there to a gorgeous saddle W of  Cascade  Mtn.  Perfect  cramponing
snow led to the N ridge and the final very steep  exposed  corniced  bit  to
the summit (2360 ft, 3 hrs). The summit itself  was  a  steep  cornice  with
nowhere to relax. I was not keen on descending the  same  way.  A  few  feet
down the W face was broken rock with a few small trees so I made  two  short
rappels with my 60 ft "panic rope" to  get  down  the  worse  of  the  steep
stuff.

Once past the W saddle, wherever the sun hit the snow it was  softening  and
I soon removed my crampons and followed my tracks back  to  the  gully  down
which I had a nice glissade. I had some  trouble  getting  around  the  lake
again as no way was I going to chance another wet foot or worse.  I  was  in
camp at 12:45 and on my way again for a second attempt on Mile High at  1:15
determined to get to the top. At least I knew  which  way  NOT  to  go  this
time. I followed my tracks to a gully I had noticed  on  the  first  attempt
that seemed to go most of the way to the N ridge. I hadn\'t followed  it  the
first time as the map indicated it curved  to  the  right  and  became  very
steep the last 200 feet and I was afraid it ended in cliffs I couldn\'t  see.
Well it did go all the way, on snow, to the ridge but  it  did  also  become
very steep near the top. A gentle section  where  I  could  breath  easy,  a
short steep climb onto the NW ridge followed by a  final  tricky  bit  along
the narrow crest and I was on top at 3:30 (1925 ft, 2:15 hrs.).

I got back to camp at 5:00 and left at 5:45. I had to hustle  if  I  was  to
hit the trail before dark. I had come up the W side of Big  Cr.   I  decided
to go down the E side. I don\'t know which side is better as  they  are  both
horrid.  I think  the  brush  is  a  little  easier  on  the  E  side  (even
discounting my futile side trip into the scrub cedar on the W side)  but  it
is longer to get to the trees. Then once there  a  large  blowdown  area  of
huge trees is all but impassible and must be bypassed  by  going  almost  to
the creek where there is more brush. Yes there is  a  fisherman\'s  trail  of
sorts (isn\'t there a fisherman\'s trail to every fishable lake?) once in  the
trees on the E side but it wanders all  over,  has  many  downed  trees  and
obstacles and I didn\'t find it much better than the open  forest  on  the  W
side. Carl Dreisbach in his Middle Fork Guide describes the route  to  Dream
Lake as 2 hours up from the trail. But then he gets through the brush  basin
by following the stream bed (in July!). Can\'t be done this time of year.

I reached the trail at 7:45 and my bike at 8:30. From midafternoon on I  had
watched the weather gradually get worse and now  it  was  raining.  It  took
until 10:00 for me to reach the car. Yes, I  have  definitely  decided  that
riding a bike with an overnight pack is not my cup of tea,  especially  when
I am exhausted, especially at night, especially when it is raining.

An interesting incidence happened about 2 miles  from  the  TH  when  I  was
startled by a scream that seemed to come out of the darkness  from  nowhere,
"He\'s friendly".  I was so unnerved I screamed back. Then I  saw  the  light
of a fellow in the trail struggling to keep  control  of  a  huge  dog  that
weighed more than I did and looked eager to devour me in one  mouthful.  The
fellow was dressed in shorts and coming UP the trail. I  didn\'t  see  if  he
had an overnight pack as my attention was on the big beast  out  to  get  me
and I have no idea where he was going or what he was doing out  so  late  in
the rain.  And people think I\'m crazy.

Total: 20 miles and 9400 ft in 2  days  (includes  unsuccessful  attempt  on
Mile High)

Sheep Rock (3500 ft - 580P) - Monitor Quad - May 4, 2007


This turned out to be another gem discovered  only  because  I  am  pursuing
Jeff\'s Master List of Peaks. As I have mentioned before, this list takes  me
to peaks I never would climb otherwise. I started from the Devils  Gulch  TH
(elev 1750 ft) on Mission Cr  out  of  Cashmere.  From  there  I  just  went
uphill, dodging small cliffs and slabs at first, to the SW ridge. I found  a
way trail that contoured around Pt 2702 and then  regained  the  ridge.  The
south side of Sheep Rock is all impressive sandstone  slabs  but  the  north
side is easily hiked.

Total: 2.7 miles, 2200 ft and 2:30 hrs.

Old Butte (1946 ft), Squaw Saddle (1982 ft) and  Castle  Rock  (1756  ft)  -
Wenatchee Quad - May 5, 2007

These are interesting crags that are very visible in the  western  foothills
just above Wenatchee. All three  are  fun  easy  scrambles  on  solid  rock,
though a bit exposed. For Old Butte and Squaw Saddle I found  public  access
just off Skyline Drive at the Jacobson Preserve TH, elev 1050 ft. From  here
a very nice trail wanders uphill. Jeff lists Old Butte as 1946 ft  but  this
turned out to be just a grassy knob. It seemed more logical to me  that  the
true "Old Butte" is the rocky crag slightly lower to the east. This is  also
where the name is placed on the map. Naturally, I climbed both  just  to  be
sure.  Squaw Saddle also has two crags. I climbed the higher one. The  lower
fin-like one looked to me to require a rope and protection. On the way  back
I climbed Pt 2228. From here I could see many inviting trails leading  west.
You could spend a full day wandering around these ridges.

Castle Rock is on private property and the hardest part of  that  climb  was
finding access that wasn\'t posted as no trespassing  or  didn\'t  go  through
someone\'s backyard. I think I spend more time looking for access than I  did
climbing it. I finally found a way by driving Castle Rock Road  to  its  end
in new housing construction (elev 1000 ft). Since these  houses  were  still
being built and were unoccupied and this was a Saturday (and there  were  no
signs), I had no qualms about parking  and  entering  there.  A  short  ways
uphill I ran into a trail that went all the way  up.  The  locals  obviously
hike Castle Rock all the time. The last bit avoided cliffs by going  to  the
right up steep loose scree. On top I climbed a short pinnacle  that  may  or
may not have been higher than the flat summit.

When Paul and Stefan invited me to join them on this trip I  jumped  at  the
chance to climb Castle. However, their plan  was  an  ambitious  4-day  high
traverse carryover bagging many other peaks along the way.  Since  I  wasn\'t
sure I had the strength or stamina to pull that off (I don\'t  do  that  well
with a full pack), I proposed  being  completely  independent  in  gear  and
starting a day early. That way I could go at my own pace to the  first  high
camp and bail out  at  any  time  if  things  got  too  much  for  me.  They
graciously accommodated me.

Day 1:  I made the long 5+ hour drive into Canada and drove to  the  end  of
the Silver-Skagit Road, which was gated at the US Border. I  biked  the  1.5-
mile road to the Hozomeen Lk trail in  20  minutes,  stashed  the  bike  and
started up the trail on foot at 2:00. Normally this is a  very  good  trail,
but it had not yet been logged out  for  the  season  and  there  were  many
blowdowns to negotiate. I wasn\'t sure how far I would get, but when  I  came
to Nightmare camp at 6:20 (after an annoying  800  ft  descent  from  Willow
Lake), it was too inviting to pass up. I am not sure why this spot is  named
"Nightmare" as it is a delightful place  to  camp,  complete  with  benches,
firepit, flat tent sites, water  and  a  toilet,  although  the  latter  was
rendered marginally usable by a blowdown on top of it.

Day 1 Total: 9.8 miles, 1400 ft, and 4:40 hrs

Day 2: After a wonderful night\'s sleep I  was  on  my  way  at  6:30.  Thank
heavens the bridge over Lightening Cr is still  intact;  else  it  would  be
impossible to cross this roaring torrent. On the other side  of  the  bridge
the start of the Freezeout Cr trail is  completely  obliterated  by  several
hundred feet of washout and avalanche debris but once  across  this  section
the trail is easily located. I was under the impression that this  abandoned
trail was in horrible shape, brushy and hard to follow. Not  so.  The  tread
is in great shape, is easily followed and there is no brush. That is not  to
say, however, that it is a piece of cake. It has not  been  logged  out  for
many years, and there are countless blowdowns. I  would  say  there  is  one
every few hundred feet or so the whole way.  Very  exhausting  to  negotiate
with a full pack. There are also four large  creeks  to  cross  that  are  a
problem this time of year. The first was  small  enough  that  it  could  be
crossed on rocks. The other three required finding logs.

I ran into sections of snow after the first  creek  crossing  that  made  it
difficult to stay on the trail at times. By the third creek crossing it  was
solid snow and progress slowed  to  a  crawl  as  I  negotiated  frustrating
inconsistent snow that varied from ice to knee deep postholing. I  also  had
trouble finding a suitable log across Freezeout Cr, the last  crossing.  All
in all it took me much longer to get to our agreed upon campsite at 5400  ft
in Freezeout Cr basin than I had hoped. I was glad I had  allowed  an  extra
day. At the first opening out of the forest I  found  a  wonderful  spot  to
camp with running water and a clear view of Castle at 3:30.

Stefan and Paul had car camped at the gate and planned to start at  6:00  am
to get all the way to camp. On the way they hoped to climb Outback and  Buck
Heaven. I didn\'t expect them until late, maybe even after dark.  So  imagine
my surprise when they showed up at 4:30.  Either they were supermen  or  the
plan had changed.  Well, the plan had changed. They had passed on the  peaks
and were so wiped out by the trip in that a carryover was now out. We  would
be doing the climb with light packs from camp. Truth be  told,  that  suited
me just fine. I was even  relieved.  We  all  spent  the  rest  of  the  day
lounging in the sun and recuperating. It was a lovely spot to do just  that.
We went to bed before 8:00.

Day 2 Total: 9 miles, 3800 ft and 9 hours

Day 3: I am absolutely amazed at how fast Stefan can be ready to go  in  the
morning. Paul is no slouch in that  department  either,  but  Stefan  really
takes the prize.  I swear from the time he poked his nose out  of  his  tent
to the time he was heading uphill was 10 minutes. Good thing  I  got  up  45
minutes before him or I would never catch up. I started  at  5:45,  maybe  5
minutes behind. It froze hard during the clear night, which  made  for  good
cramponing. Castle Pk was first up as we climbed to the head of  the  valley
and up a steep couloir leading to the SW shoulder at 7900 ft,  then  up  the
shoulder to the summit at 8:15 (2950 ft, 2:30 hr). We found  a  pill  bottle
register placed the year before by Mike Collins and Don Beavon.

Next was Full Moon  Rising  Pk.  I  elected  to  downclimb  the  couloir  by
frontpointing facing in. Stefan and Paul came down the SW ridge to the  side
of the couloir.  After  descending  to  about  6000  ft,  we  began  a  long
exhausting traverse around the head  of  Freezeout  Cr  basin.  By  now  the
slopes were in the sun and the snow was beginning to soften,  in  places  to
kneedeep, or worse, postholing.  The guys had more problem with this than  I
did. I was often able to stay on the surface while  they  broke  through.  I
tried to do my share of trailbreaking but it didn\'t help  much.  They  would
just break through my steps. After what seemed an interminable traverse,  we
crossed the ridge into Boundary Cr, descended a bit, traversed  around  this
basin and climbed the SW slope to  the  summit  ridge.  Naturally  the  high
point was at the far end, which we reached at 1:25 (5000 ft, 7:40 hr).  Here
we found John Roper\'s film can register of 1983.

On to Buck Heaven Mtn. After a  fast  glissade  off  Full  Moon  Rising,  we
regained the ridge leading to Buck Heaven and had a pleasant walk along  the
ridge to that summit at 3:10 (5600 ft, 9:30). By now Stefan  was  in  summit
mode and a good 15 minutes ahead of Paul and me. He  had  blown  right  over
the summit and was already on his way to the last one of  the  day,  Outback
Mtn (although he did stop long enough for his customary "kiss the  summit").
 At this point I was beginning to feel a "wee" bit  tired.  I  sat  on  Buck
Heaven (truly a heavenly spot), looking across to Outback a  good  mile  and
800 ft gain away, wondering if I had it in me to continue. I  guess  I  did,
though barely, as I made that summit at 4:30 (6500 ft, 10:45 hrs).  On  this
summit I gloried in the perfect weather  and  fantastic  views  all  around.
Especially  striking  was  Hozomeen.   All  day  the  distinctive  and  very
impressive S Peak was in view and a constant reminder of  one  of  the  most
memorable climbs of my life. It was so satisfying to look at that  peak  and
say "been there, done that!"

We still had to get back to camp. The snow conditions were  now  mush.  Paul
and Stefan had lugged snowshoes  along  all  day  in  anticipation  of  such
conditions. In fact Stefan had used snowshoes from Buck Heaven on. Paul  now
used his. I had elected to take my  chances  and  had  left  mine  in  camp.
Although I sank in a bit, it wasn\'t too bad  and  it  worked  out  okay.  We
descended back to the saddle with Buck Heaven, where we had left our  packs,
and then traversed the basin SW of Buck Heaven until we could  climb  up  to
the S ridge. Once across, a series of glissades and traverses  got  us  back
to camp at 6:30. I for one was absolutely beat. Paul  and  Stefan  had  four
more peaks on their agenda for the next day, but I knew I would not be  able
to put in another day like today back-to-back.

Day 3 Total: 10 miles, 7150ft and 12:45 hours

Day 4:  I thought  about  my  options  overnight  and  decided  I  would  do
Freezeout Mtn with the guys and then reassess.  I got  up  an  hour  earlier
than Stefan at 4:45 so I would be ready to go at  6:00  and  he  still  left
before I did.  It is just impossible to get ahead of this  guy!  We  carried
full packs down to the creek draining the 6639 lake S of Freezeout,  stashed
gear and continued up the left side of the creek with daypacks  starting  at
8:00. The first part was in easy forest to an open slide alder  basin  where
another creek draining the lake below Joker joined in. A  short  section  of
brush and small trees led above a waterfall and into the snow  filled  gully
itself. The snow was hard enough to require crampons. Open slopes  then  led
to the SE ridge. The final bit along  the  ridge  was  easy  but  loose  and
unpleasant scree and talus. We summitted at 11:30 (3840 ft, 5:30 hrs).

Various body parts were now beginning to object to the abuse to  which  they
had been subjected the last 4 days, but I felt I still had  enough  left  in
me to make Three Aunts, especially since it was so  close  and  looked  easy
and would actually provide a better way down  than  from  Freezeout.  So  we
followed the ridge SE arriving on the first summit  at  12:30.  Three  Aunts
shows two summits each with an elevation of 7760+ ft. No one could tell  for
sure which was higher so we went on to the second  summit.  It  then  became
clear the first (W) summit was higher. We were back to this summit  at  1:10
(4600 ft, 7:10 hr). Previously mentioned body  parts  were  now  complaining
loudly and it was clear to me this was my last summit of  the  trip.  So  we
said our goodbyes and Stefan and Paul headed  for  Three  Uncles  and  Joker
while I headed down.

After a nice glissade followed by deep postholing I  reached  the  overnight
packs at 3:30 and continued out. My goal was  just  to  get  all  the  creek
crossings out of the way and camp on bare ground. Most of my  gear  was  wet
by now and I really didn\'t want to camp on snow again. But for  some  reason
I just kept going, despite my right hip and left  foot  (bunion)  giving  me
much grief, and made it all the way to Nightmare camp at 8:40  where  I  ate
dinner in the dark but spent a warm pleasant nightâ¦ until  sometime  in  the
wee small hours I heard the telltale pitter-patter of raindrops on  my  bivy
tent. This was totally unexpected. Rain had not been predicted at  all.  But
this was the North Cascades where anything can happen. I had spread  my  wet
gear out all over the log benches to semidry and had  to  scurry  around  in
the dark to get it all under cover. I listened  to  rain  the  rest  of  the
night.

Day 4 Total: 14 miles, 5050 ft and 14:50 hours.

Day 5: When I awoke at 6:00 it was still raining and everything was  wet.  I
hurriedly packed up, forgoing a proper breakfast, and took off at  6:40.  My
pack  felt  heavier  than  on  the  way  in.  But  now  I  knew  why  I  had
instinctively pushed so hard to make Nighmare the  day  before.   I  was  so
glad not to have to negotiate the creek crossings and  all  those  blowdowns
in the rain. The trip out was slow and painful but relatively short  and  at
least all body parts were still functioning, more  or  less.  I  reached  my
bike at 10:40 and the car at 11:00.

Day 5 Total: 9.8 miles, 880 ft and 4:20 hours.

I want to thank Stefan and Paul for allowing me to join  their  trip.  I  am
very satisfied with what I was able to do.  From my point of view  the  trip
was a success once I set foot on the summit of Castle. All other peaks  were
a bonus.  I have no regrets about turning around when  I  did.   Oh  sure  I
would have liked to have made those last two peaks, but  I  really  think  I
pushed myself as far as was prudent.

Stefan and Paul did climb (of course they did!) Three Uncles and  Joker  and
got down to their overnight gear around 6:00 where they spent the  night  on
the snow. They reached the car at 2:30 the next day.

Grand Total: 52.6 mile and 18,280 ft in 5 days

Silver Eagle Pk (aka Bald Eagle Pk) - 6259 ft - 1019P - Big Snow Mtn Quad -
May 17, 2007


I am not sure what to call this peak. Beckey calls  it  Bald  Eagle.  Jeff\'s
Master List calls it Silver Eagle. The map calls the 6241 ft  peak  next  to
it Bald Eagle, as does Jeff while Beckey calls that one Silver Eagle. It  is
all too confusing for me. I am going with Jeff. You may call the  peak  what
you wish.  Whatever the name, I had this peak on my list  ever  since  doing
the companion 6241 ft one with Mitch in 2003.  Oh, and it is  a  Home  Court
Peak.

I started at 8:20 from just across the bridge over the  E  Fork  Foss  River
and headed uphill through open woods to the N ridge.  I  then  followed  the
ridge most of the way. It was easy going to start with little or  no  brush.
I began running into snow about 4000 ft and it became  consistent  somewhere
about 4500. For the most part I stayed right on the nose of the  ridge  with
very little variation. I passed a rock  step  at  about  4600  ft  and  then
increasingly deep slushy unreliable snow on the narrow corniced  ridge  made
travel slower and more difficult. I stuck with the ridge to  about  5200  ft
where I was forced to descend to the left (E) to avoid  cliffs.  Steep  snow
led back to the ridge above the cliffs. There was  one  final  narrow  rocky
section passed on the right (W) before the summit. I started in fog  but  by
the time I made the summit at 2:45 the sun had appeared and  glorious  views
of the Alpine Lakes with it. I spent a good hour  on  top  enjoying  it  and
them. I found a film can register left by Fred Beavon in August,  2006.  All
in all a very nice scramble but harder and longer than expected due to  snow
conditions. At least I did get down before dark (7:40).

Total: 6 miles, 5100 ft and 11:20 hrs.

Wild Dare Pk (5311 ft - 671P - Snoqualmie Pass Quad) - May 22, 2007


I cannot really recommend this peak, at least not by the route  I  took.  It
is probably only of interest to deranged peak  baggers  and  Home  Courters.
Most of the way is very unpleasant brush and  windfall  broken  up  by  many
mossy cliff bands and is slow going indeed. Of course it didn\'t help that  I
was in fog all day, had no views and, although it wasn\'t raining, it may  as
well have been since the brush was dripping wet from the  previous  day  and
night\'s deluge.

The good news is the Middle Fork Road has been recently  graded  and  is  in
good shape now, much better than when I was up it a couple of weeks  ago  to
climb Cascade and Mile High. You can  actually  drive  it  at  a  reasonable
speed. I parked at the Dingford Cr TH, took the trail  down  to  the  bridge
across the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River  and  almost  immediately  left  the
trail to head up the NE ridge. The  first  600  ft  were  in  pleasant  open
forest and I was encouraged that all would go well.  That didn\'t last  long.
At about 2000 ft elev I hit a mossy cliff band. However,  a  way  trail  led
around to the left and threaded its way up.  I was  still  encouraged.  Then
it all  fell  apart.  The  trail  disappeared,  brush  and  myriad  windfall
appeared, there were more cliff bands to negotiate and progress slowed.

Somewhere around 4000 ft consistent snow helped  considerably  and  progress
improved. Improvement was soon lost again trying to get around  Pt  5082.  A
seemingly too steep traverse (tried too high) tricked me to go up  and  over
5082 where I was soon cliffed  out  on  the  ridge  and  forced  to  descend
treacherous mixed terrain.  The  final  snowy  slopes  to  the  summit  were
blessedly easy in comparison but very slushy  with  a  covering  of  several
inches of new. I finally reached the wooded top at 2:45 (4400  ft,  6  hrs).
On the way down I took the traverse around 5082 low, at about 4550 ft.  This
worked much better. The rest of  the  way  I  had  trouble  staying  on  the
indistinct ridge and managed to find even worse brush and windfall  than  on
the way up.

Total: 4.5 miles, 4650 ft and 10:45 hrs.

2007

I already had a plan to climb Garfield East Pk and Treen  on  a  2-day  trip
approaching from Green Ridge Lake trail, when  I  had  a  conversation  with
Mitch at Don Beavon\'s K2 party. I mentioned that I was very  intimidated  by
Garfield Mtn and didn\'t know if I would ever get up the  thing.  He  replied
that it was fairly easy from the north if done early enough that the  summit
gully was completely snow filled. I asked  how  he  got  across  the  Taylor
River as the only north route I was aware of started from the  Taylor  River
trail and had to cross the river. He answered  that  it  could  be  accessed
from the Green Ridge Lake trail and a crossover gully  near  Lower  Garfield
Mtn Lk. Great! He did caution, however, that it  was  probably  already  too
late in the season for the gully to go. Still,  I  was  going  to  the  area
anyway. I would add another possible day  and  just  see  how  it  went.  It
turned out Mitch was right, of course, but I had to try.

Day 1: After my experience climbing Wild Dare and crashing  brush  just  two
days earlier on the other side of the  Middle  Fork  Snoqualmie  River,  the
Green Ridge Lake way trail was a sheer delight. It starts  just  before  the
Middle Fork road crosses Green Ridge Lake Cr at  1320  ft  elev  and  climbs
relentlessly, but with little brush or windfall,  and  is  easily  followed.
At 3500 ft the main trail leaves the ridge to traverse to  the  lake,  where
most people (i.e. fishermen) presumably go. The way along the ridge  becomes
less distinct, but since it follows the crest it is no problem  to  stay  on
it. Somewhere around 4500 ft I all of a sudden hit snow and it was snow  the
rest of the way. I found it easier to continue left on the ridge going  over
two bumps, despite added elevation gain, rather than trying  to  contour  to
my campsite just above the tarn at 4662 ft elev (2Â¼ m, 3750  ft,  3:50  hr).
The tarn was melted out just enough to provide liquid water.

I set up camp and left for Garfield Mtn East Pk at 2:00. I had a  good  view
from camp. It looked so close. Yeah, right.  This  is  one  of  Mark  Owen\'s
favorite climbs. But the normal route starts from East Pass after  a  direct
approach up a gully from the Middle Fork road. First I had to  get  to  East
Pass. I didn\'t anticipate it being so much trouble. I stayed  on  the  ridge
and found the only way past Pt 4962 was to go over the top. By  the  time  I
got to East Pass it was already 3:30. Then there was another 4920+  ft  bump
in the way I had to go over. I finally started up the main E ridge at  4:10.


An initial rock wall forced a bypass left up steep dirt  and  snow  until  I
could gain the ridge again. It  was  then  a  series  of  tiptoes  along  or
slightly below the undulating crest, sometimes on rock, sometimes  on  snow.
I do believe it would have been easier if it had been all snow or all  rock.
As it was the combination made for tricky going,  especially  at  transition
points from one to the other. At one point I was  forced  to  crawl  a  deep
moat and slither through a dripping snow tunnel to get  onto  bypass  ledges
on the right side. At another point I was tricked onto some  appealing  rock
straight up the crest only to have it  cliff  out.  I  had  to  retreat  and
bypass to the left. The final bit to the top was snow  free,  dry  rock  and
this section I really enjoyed. I reached the  summit  at  6:00,  much  later
than I had hoped for (1700 ft, 4 hrs).

Views of the whole Garfield massive  were  very  impressive.   I  could  see
Garfield Mtn, Courte Echelle, North  Peak,  Outrigger  Spire  plus  numerous
other unnamed pinnacles. This is one rugged area. There were no shortage  of
summit registers - three to be exact.  Unfortunately none were of  any  use.
Two, one in a PVC tube and the other in a small poly  bottle,  were  useless
sodden messes. The third, a film can, was dry but only contained  one  piece
of empty paper. Did the leavers forget to sign their own register?  And  now
there are four registers as I left one of my own.

By the time I returned to the saddle at the base of the main  ridge  it  was
7:45. The thought of retracing my steps over Pt  4920+,  East  Pass  and  Pt
4962 was not appealing. It would probably take close to 2 hours  and  I  was
running out of daylight. It looked to me as  if  I  could  descend  directly
from the saddle into the basin above Upper Garfield Mtn Lk,  traverse  below
all the cliffs and then climb up to camp, all on snow.  This I  did  and  it
worked well, although I did have to descend to 4200  ft  and  the  snow  was
very slushy.  I should have approached this  way  as  well.  It  would  have
saved me at least an hour. I got back to camp at 8:40,  tired  and  wet  but
very satisfied. (3 m, 2400 ft, 6:40 hrs)

Day1 Total: 5 Â¼ miles, 6150 ft and 10:30 hrs

Day 2: Treen Pk - Treen was a piece of cake.   No  problems  whatsoever  and
the climb went faster than expected, despite having to descend all  the  way
to Upper Garfield Mtn Lk at 4000 ft. How often does a climb go  faster  than
expected? Not that often. From Upper Garfield  Mtn  Lk  I  made  my  way  to
Charlie Brown Lk where a narrow avalanche gully provided a direct  route  to
a 5000 ft snow basin on the S slope. From here an open slope led  to  the  S
ridge and hence the summit at 9:00 (1775 ft, 2:20 hrs). Although  relatively
warm, the clear night had  frozen  the  surface  in  the  open  and  I  used
crampons on the upper slopes, although  I  probably  could  have  gotten  by
without them.

It was now on to give Garfield Mtn a try. To this end I descended  to  Lower
Garfield Mtn Lk at 3600 ft. I had no trouble  finding  the  crossover  gully
that would lead to the north route, but I didn\'t like the looks  of  it.  It
was an ugly narrow ribbon of snow snaking up a deep dark cleft, broken  near
the top. I wasted time waffling before deciding it probably  wasn\'t  as  bad
as it looked (it wasn\'t), but I did have some nasty wet  pull-ups  on  brush
belays getting past a small waterfall near the top. Once up, it was an  easy
snow traverse below the cliffs of Outrigger Spire until  I  could  climb  to
North Pass. I descended a couple hundred feet into the basin  on  the  other
side where I finally got my first view of the  Garfield  summit  gully.   My
heart sank.  I could see it broken about half way up.  Mitch  was  right.  I
was too late. Still I wasn\'t positive I couldn\'t  get  across.  I  had  come
this far. I had to make sure.  So I climbed up to the break.  I  could  find
no way across and believe me I looked. The break went  all  the  way  across
the gully, only filled a bit in the center  with  rotten  snow.   Underneath
was a deep moat that looked bottomless. To the right was vertical cliff.  To
the left were wet downsloping slabs capped by  precarious  snow.  Everything
was primed for collapse.  It was a scary spot and I  got  out  of  there  as
soon as possible. It was 2:50.

Of course I was disappointed but it was just not to  be,  and  I  really  do
value my life more than any summit. I was  probably  150  ft  from  the  col
between Garfield and Leaning Spire.  I am told  that  from  the  col  it  is
mostly an easy scramble to the top. So close  and  yet  so  far.  As  if  to
underscore my retreat, while climbing back to North Pass  I  saw  and  heard
several snow chunks let loose off the cliffs. I dragged the rest of the  way
back to camp where the 1100-foot climb through  slush  from  Lower  Garfield
Lake seemed to take forever. Although I made camp at 6:00, I was  too  tired
to go out that day. I spent the rest of the afternoon  lounging  and  drying
out in the sun.

Day 2 Total: 7 miles, 5300 ft and 11: 20 hrs

Day 3: All day yesterday I watched the sky gradually cloud up.  It  was  not
the perfect blue-sky day predicted, but it wasn\'t  bad  either.  Fortunately
the sun came out in the afternoon strong enough to dry things out  and  warm
me up. I figured  it  was  a  sign  of  approaching  weather  so  it  didn\'t
surprised me when there were a few sprinkles during the night.  But  it  was
nothing serious and the morning dawned cloudy but  dry.   I  was  just  very
happy I didn\'t have to descend the steep trail in the rain.  I  reached  the
car at 11:00. On the drive out along the Middle Fork road  I  had  to  dodge
all the  vehicles  (cars,  motorcycles  and  bicycles)  coming  in  for  the
Memorial Day weekend.

Day 3 Total: 2 Â¼ miles, 350 ft and 2:50 hrs.

I did make my original goal of climbing Garfield East Pk  and  Treen  and  I
was happy with that. I found the East Peak to be a  challenging  interesting
climb.  As for Garfield, there is always next year  (the  end  of  April  or
beginning of May should be about the right  timing  for  the  north  route),
unless, of course, I can twist some poor sap\'s  arm  to  accompany  me  this
year up the south side. That is one route I don\'t want to solo.

Grand Total: 14.5 miles and 11, 800 ft in 3 days

3, 2007

Day 1: I do believe I have figured out how to keep up with the  Superguys  -
start a day early and come out a day late. Sure works for me.  That  was  my
plan when Paul Klenke invited me along on his  one-day  7500+  ft  climb  of
Sherman and Colfax. Then Mike Collins decided to join me on my  head  start.
So I would have company after all. Mike and I started from where Road 13  is
blocked by snow (elev 3200 ft) Â½ mile before Schriebers Meadow at  12:30  on
Friday. It was warm and sunny but a stiff wind kept us cool  as  we  trudged
up the boot and snowmobile tracks to a scenic campsite near the  last  trees
at 5500 ft on Railroad Grade (3.5 miles,  2300  ft,  3:30  hrs).  We  hauled
water from 500 ft below so we wouldn\'t have to melt snow.

Day 2: Superguys Paul and Dave Creeden  started  Saturday  morning  at  5:30
from the cars taking a direct line up the Scott Paul  trail  to  Crag  View.
Art Freeman and Silas Wild followed a half hour later  carrying  skis.  Mike
and I left from our camp at 6:10 traversing across the lower Easton  Glacier
to intersect the Squak Glacier above Crag View at about  6800  ft.  We  felt
comfortable climbing unroped as crevasses were few and snowmobiles had  been
over the terrain. We were about 500 ft above Paul and Dave  who  were  maybe
1000 ft above Art and Silas. We all kept in touch with 2-way  radios.   Mike
and I continued climbing up the Squak  to  just  below  the  rime  festooned
summit ridge of Sherman where we met up with Paul and Dave.  The four of  us
summitted together at 10:50 (4650 ft, 4:40 hrs).

Art  and  Silas  were  still  climbing  up  when  we  left  the  summit  and
unfortunately I never even got to  see  them.   I  had  never  climbed  with
either one before and was looking forward  to  that  changing  but  it  just
didn\'t happen. Dave (who had already climbed Colfax) returned the  same  way
planning to run into those two. He left the rope (which he had carried up  -
thanks Dave) for Paul, Mike and me to use. We needed  it  for  the  traverse
across the upper Easton and Deming Glaciers  to  Coleman  Saddle,  as  there
were many crevasses  on  this  traverse.  From  the  saddle  it  was  fairly
straightforward up the east ridge of  Colfax,  although  getting  around  Pt
9355 gave a moment of pause (it was passed on  the  left).  We  reached  the
summit at 1:40 (5300 ft, 7:30 hrs).

Views were gorgeous on this perfect weather day (except for  the  wind  that
howled through Coleman Saddle. Surprisingly, though, it  wasn\'t  that  windy
on the summit.) Lincoln was particularly  impressive.   In  fact  it  looked
downright frightening.  It may be next on the list  for  me  if  I  can  get
myself psyched up for it. We spent about 30 minutes on top before  taking  a
direct route from the saddle down the Deming Glacier to Railroad  Grade.  We
had only a few wimpy glissades in the soft wet slush of  afternoon  and  hit
camp at 4:20 (9 miles, 5500 ft, 9:10 hrs). Mike  packed  up  and  left  with
Paul.  Although I had the time  and  energy  to  go  out,  my  camp  was  so
pleasant I elected to stay another night and further savor  the  experience.
I had a view of Twin Sisters to one side and all of Baker  to  other  and  I
let another good climb digest as I lounged  in  the  sun  the  rest  of  the
afternoon. Besides, I had plans for a few more minor summits the  next  day.
The only fly in the ointment was the incessant sound of snowmobiles  buzzing
around. I don\'t know of a more annoying sound in the world. It is  up  there
on a par with a mosquito in your ear. Eventually they all went  to  wherever
it is those nasty machines go at  night  and  left  what  really  should  be
wilderness in peace and quiet.

Day 3: The next day I climbed four minor summits in the area. Although  only
Park Butte has prominence, the other three  named  features  are  all  quite
notable, interesting and fun  little  climbs.  I  first  traversed  over  to
Meadow Point from camp, which was farther than it looked (3 miles, 900 ft  &
2:20 hrs RT). It had a cute rocky bump for a top and a great view  into  the
chasm of the lower Deming Glacier. I then packed up and left camp  at  9:00.
I dropped my big pack at Baker Pass for the 200 ft climb up Cathedral  Crag.
At first I didn\'t think I was going to be able to get the final  rocky  crag
without a rope, but then I found a treed ledge on the  right  that  was  the
key.

I dropped my pack again at the saddle between Cathedral Crag and Park  Butte
at 10:30. I took some time finding a place to  hide  it.  I  had  thought  I
would get away from the snowmobiles in this area, that they would all be  on
the main slopes of Mt Baker. It was just my luck that  a  group  decided  to
use Park Butte and Survey Point  as  their  playground  right  while  I  was
there. You just cannot get away  from  them  here.  They  go  everywhere.  I
climbed directly to the lookout on Park Butte. From there I headed  over  to
Survey Point, dropping some 700 feet to  Pocket  Lake  before  regaining  it
again to the summit. Survey Point probably has the best overall view of  the
whole south side of Mt Baker.  There was even a glass jar register  on  top,
but I was unable to screw off the rusted cap. I  was  back  to  my  pack  at
1:20. I was beginning to feel the effects of the very warm  day.  The  final
trudge out in the sweltering sun and soft snow I felt as if  I  were  in  an
oven. By the time I reached  the  car,  where  it  was  82  degrees,  I  was
definitely cooked to overdone (8 miles, 2000 ft, 6:30 from camp).

Art and Silas did summit Sherman making that #100 for Silas on  the  400  ft
Clean Prominence Highest List. Congratulations Silas! They then had  a  nice
ski down.

Grand Total: 23.5 miles and 10,700 ft in three days

Lincoln Pk Attempt (9080 ft)- June 17-18, 2007


Although this was an unsuccessful climb, it still warrants at least a  short
report with a few pictures. Let me begin by  stating  that  all  reports  of
Lincoln being a difficult and steep  alpine  climb  are  true.  It  is  most
certainly the hardest snow climb I have ever  attempted  and  challenged  my
limits.

Prospects were not great from the get-go as Paul K, Tom  S,  Mike  C  and  I
started from 3500 ft on Rd 38 on Sunday in a steady rain.  Three  hours  and
2600 ft of misery through dense brush on the  approach  didn\'t  do  much  to
improve our spirits. We found a pleasant enough bare ground campsite on  the
ridge at 5900 ft, but by then we were all soaking wet and only had  thoughts
of hunkering down in our tents. Rain continued to nightfall  and  visibility
was limited.

Monday dawned with no rain, lifting fog and improving weather. But we  could
see the upper mountain covered with fresh white. We roped up at  about  6500
ft. The bergschrund (7500 ft) was passed on the left side and from  here  on
the route was steep and stayed steep with very  few  spots  to  rest.  Also,
here the precipitation of the previous  day  had  fallen  as  freezing  rain
leaving a slick hard ice coating on the surface of the snow. This  made  for
slow progress as the leaders worked to kick steps through the ice layer  and
put in pickets for protection.   We  had  8  pickets,  which  seemed  barely
adequate at the time.  Each climber had two ice axes or  tools.  We  climbed
as two teams on 60 M ropes.

Tom took the lead up past the bergshrund for 500 ft and Paul took  over  for
the traverse to and climb up the middle (crux) gully. On both  the  traverse
and in the gully we were constantly exposed to  small  ice  pebbles  falling
from the cliffs above as the day warmed up. The gully  itself  had  a  well-
used runnel in the center down which small sluffs were  constantly  running.
Occasionally, a larger slide would whoosh past as we climbed on the side.  A
couple a times rocks came zipping down. Miraculously, no one  got  hit  with
anything significant.

The top of the middle gully (8500 ft)  ended  in  a  peculiar  very  exposed
knife-edged snow arÃªte. Another difficult traverse was required to  continue
to the next gully and summit ridge.  It was  now  1:00  and  with  our  slow
progress it was clear we did not have time to reach the top.  We  began  the
slow nerve racking process of going down. It took 7 rappels, 5 from  pickets
and 2 from rock horns, and 6.5 hrs to get off the steep stuff. Paul came  up
with the idea of going straight down from the middle gully  to  a  gully  to
skiers right of bergshrund slope. This saved some  time  by  not  having  to
reverse the traverse, but still was no piece of cake.  Most  of  the  rappel
points were award stances on steep terrain. The last rappel down the  narrow
gully ended in a vertical ice wall. Definitely one of the  more  interesting
rappels of my climbing career.

We all breathed a sight of relief when we were once  again  on  gentle  safe
terrain.  It was now 7:30. We were back to camp at 8:45 and  packed  up  and
ready to go by 9:15. We had just as miserable a trip down the brushy  ridge,
which had not dried due to valley fog. We almost  missed  the  road  in  the
dark, finally staggering to the car at midnight. As the  designated  driver,
I managed to stay alert enough to drive us home. I reached my home  just  as
the eastern sky was beginning to lighten for a new  day.  (4:15  am).  I  do
believe that is the latest I have ever returned from a climb. It was  a  24-
hour day from rising in the morning to  when  my  head  hit  a  pillow  once
again.

Soâ¦ no summit.  But surely a memorable alpine climb, with a great  group  of
guys, that stretched my limits. It is now unfinished business  that  I  will
hopefully finish some day. I seem to be having a lot of unfinished  business
this year

This was a spur of the moment trip after coming home late on Sunday  from  a
trip to Albuquerque to visit family. I was itching to get out after  a  week
off and wanted to take advantage of good weather  before  it  turned  again.
This meant I only had a day to get organized  and  pack  before  leaving  on
Tuesday, which resulted in a few errors, such as forgetting my  dinner.  But
it was totally worth the rush and effort.

Day 1: I was able to drive all the way to  the  Watson  Lakes  TH  (off  the
Baker Lake Road), but just barely and only because some big  rigs  had  made
tracks through a couple of snow patches. I started from the  TH,  elev  4300
ft, at 11:30 and ran into solid snow after about  a  mile  where  the  trail
enters meadows. From  a  little  below  the  saddle  above  Watson  Lakes  I
contoured and climbed to Upper Anderson Lake where I took a gully  to  cross
the NW ridge of Mt Watson  to  the  extensive  snowfield  on  the  N  slope,
climbing to 5600 ft below the saddle with the W Pk. Here I  dropped  my  big
pack at 2:50. From the saddle  a  combination  of  rather  unpleasant  steep
snow, dirt and heather led to the rocky summit at 3:40. I found no  register
so left one. I had a good view of Bacon.  My but it looked a long  ways  off
with many cliffs and obstacles on route.

I was back to my pack at 4:20. I now had to drop to 4800 ft  to  get  around
the extensive cliffs of Watson\'s NE ridge, then climb up past a frozen  tarn
to 5400 ft at the saddle just W of  Pt  5580.  Here  I  found  a  delightful
heather bench for a bivy at 5:40 (5 miles,  3200  ft,  6:10  hrs,  including
climb of Mt Watson). I was pleased not to have to camp on  snow.  There  was
even running water off a nearby cliff and a fantastic view  of  Mt  Shuksan.
What more could I ask for?

After setting up camp I left for the SE Pk of Watson at 6:25, climbing  snow
alongside an impressive pile of huge snow chunks  that  had  avalanched  off
slabs. Once on the SE ridge an enjoyable scramble  led  to  that  summit  at
7:00 and more views of Bacon. It didn\'t look any closer  or  easier  to  get
to. I was in camp again at 7:40 (1/2 mile, 500 ft, 1:15 hr RT)  with  plenty
of time for a leisurely dinner, especially since I had no dinner to eat.   I
couldn\'t believe I had forgotten it. I made do  with  soup  and  snacks  and
tea.

Day 2: Bacon Pk - The next morning I did have a breakfast  to  eat  and  was
ready to go at 6:20. It had been a warm night with some cloud cover  and  it
did not freeze. I descended easy soft snow to two lakes  at  4450  ft,  then
contoured E below cliffs descending another  couple  hundred  feet  until  I
could ascend again to the basin S of Bacon that  contained  a  frozen  tarn.
This was the hardest and most unpleasant part of the whole trip. I  followed
a nasty gully with snow at the bottom and wet rock approaching  class  4  in
places near the top to get through the cliffs,  traversing  right  onto  the
basin at about 5000 ft.

From the basin I followed a broad snow gully through cliffs above the  tarn.
A large avalanche had come down this gully very recently,  within  the  last
couple of days. Above, another steeper gully to the  right  put  me  on  the
main S ridge of Bacon. I elected to stay on the crest of the  ridge,  mainly
because it looked difficult to drop off an almost vertical cornice onto  the
easier E slopes. The first part of the ridge was fun rock scrambling.  Later
in the year, probably the whole ridge would be fun rock, but now part of  it
was still a knife-edge snow ridge that gave  me  pause.  I  was  reduced  to
straddling a portion of the most exposed  part  but  it  was  still  fun.  I
dropped to the E slopes as soon  as  possible  to  contour  around  a  false
summit then climbed a final knife-edge snow ridge to the small rocky top  at
10:50 (3 miles, 3000 ft, 4:30 hrs). I found  the  register  placed  by  Mike
Torok on 7/25/02. The notepad inside was soggy but still legible.   I  tried
to dry it out a bit. The last entry was by Paul  Klenke,  Dave  Creeden  and
Martin Shetter on 8/19/06. They climbed in 6.5  hours  from  the  TH!  Also
signing in were Don and Natala Goodman on 7/3/06. Don had last been  on  the
peak in 1984. Both the Goodmans and Mike (with Matt Burton and others)  were
on longer traverses and came in a different way than I did.

I had great views of a sea of peaks, most  of  which  I  couldn\'t  identify.
Bacon is really a lovely peak with extensive beautiful snowfields on  the  E
slopes. They were so inviting that in order to extend my stay, I climbed  Pt
6561 before leaving. (This point has an elevation 6580+ on  the  USGS  Bacon
Pk quad but is listed as 6561 on the  GT  Marblemount  map  and  in  Beckey.
Perhaps a later survey?). This put me on a lower traverse on E slopes  below
the S ridge on my return. I did have to climb the steep cornice back to  the
ridge but it was easier up than it would have been down.

From the S basin I tried a different way  down  than  my  nasty  gully  that
initially was easier but eventually I was funneled into another  gully  that
had some tricky moves and even  required  a  short  rappel  to  get  past  a
waterfall. If there is a better way past those lower cliffs  I  didn\'t  find
it. After the 1000 ft climb back up to camp at 4:20 (8 miles,  5500  ft,  10
hrs), I was hot, tired  and  dehydrated  and  needed  a  short  rest  before
packing up and heading out at 5:30.  I  tried  a  lower  traverse  below  Mt
Watson to Anderson Lake, but because of terrain features and steep slopes  I
still had to climb quite a bit and ended up crossing Watson\'s  NW  ridge  at
the same point. I reached the car at 8:30 (4.5 miles, 1100 ft,  3  hrs  from
camp).

Hozomeen Mtn (8066 ft - 3966P - Hozomeen Mtn Quad) - June 30-July 2, 2007


Forget all those horror stories about Hozomeen.  It doesn\'t have  to  be.  I
found this peak to be downright enjoyable. It all comes down  to  route  and
conditions. Our route was pleasant and our conditions  almost  perfect.  And
we took our time, at least Beth and I did. Determined not  turn  this  climb
into the usual one day marathon book ended by a 5-hour  drive,  Beth  and  I
planned from the start a 3-day trip and a mostly  trail  approach  from  the
north through Canada. Mike  T  and  Matt,  constrained  by  work  schedules,
condensed their trip to two days.

Day 1: We drove to the Skyline II TH (elev 1650 ft)  off  the  Silver-Skagit
Road a few miles before the US border in BC in  two  separate  vehicles  and
started up the trail at 10:45. Ordinarily this  trail  would  be  very  easy
hiking. The tread is in good shape and the grade gentle.   But  it  had  not
yet been logged out this year and there were  a  surprising  number  of  new
blowdowns to contend with. Also  the  grade  was  so  gentle  with  so  many
switchbacks, that the trail took  forever  to  get  anywhere  and  gain  any
elevation. Still, it was for the most part pleasant hiking, the  woods  were
lovely and it certainly beat crashing brush on the  usual  route.  The  last
couple miles broke out into open meadows with both views of Hozomeen  and  a
profusion of wildflowers. At 4:15 we reached the marked  trail  junction  on
Hozomeen Ridge and found a wonderful campsite about  0.75  mile  farther  south
along the ridge (8.5 miles, 4700 ft, 6:30 hrs). A snowpatch nearby  provided
running water and we had a stunning view of our peak. There  was  more  snow
on it than I expected and it looked darn steep (I do not like  steep  snow),
but that actually turned out to work in our favor.

Day 2: We started at 5:50 by following the good way trail  south  along  the
ridge. Although there was considerable up and  down,  the  way  was  through
very pleasant meadows and woods. After about 2 miles  we  came  to  a  rocky
peak that we had to get around (I will refer to this peak  as  "Monument  74
Peak"). We tried to contour around it but ran into slabby cliffs.  Beth  and
Matt continued on the contour and  forced  a  way  around  but  declared  it
wasn\'t worth the effort.  Mike and I decided it was easier to  go  over  the
top despite an extra 500 ft of gain. We all met up  at  the  saddle  on  the
other side and then crossed the US border at Monument 74.

From the saddle we contoured beneath  cliffs  onto  the  snowfield  directly
below the north face of Hozomeen donning crampons and  ice  axe.  The  route
went up the lower snowfield traversing right at its top below a  cliff  band
on a snow finger to a middle snowfield. Matt led this section. Without  this
snowfinger it would be much more difficult to  gain  the  middle  snowfield.
Yes, we definitely hit conditions just  right.  From  the  middle  snowfield
another cliffband guarded an upper snowfield and we had a  choice  of  going
left to the NE ridge or right to the NW ridge. From below, the NE ridge  had
looked more friendly but once at  the  middle  snowfield  it  was  obviously
better to the right and the NW ridge. Another steep snow  traverse,  led  by
Mike, gained access to that ridge at a very exposed spot. The next  30  feet
were the most intimidating  of  the  whole  climb,  mostly  because  of  the
exposure which fell a few thousand feet down the  W  face  and  because  the
holds seemed less than secure to me. But once past that, the rock laid  back
and it was an easy scramble the rest of the way to the summit  (3200  ft,  5
hrs).

The register was placed 5/31/92  by  Don  Goodman.  Jim  Brisbine  and  Mike
Collins signed in on 6/23/05 and Paul Klenke and Dave  Creeden  on  7/22/06.
Both those climbs had more difficult conditions than we  did.  The  view  of
South Hozomeen was incredible. We could see much of the route  we  had  done
last year (Both Beth and Mike were on that climb  also).  I  still  find  it
hard to believe I climbed that monster.  Although  the  day  was  sunny  and
warm, there was a very cold wind blowing on top and I was  chilling  rapidly
so I started down before the others to escape  it.  I  also  wanted  a  head
start so I could take my time downclimbing the rock. The  last  30  feet  to
the snow was as nerve-wracking  as  I  expected,  and  the  two  steep  snow
traverses took care but for the most part the whole climb turned out  to  be
easier than I had anticipated and, dare I say it, even fun.

On the way back we all went over the top of Monument 74 Peak and  even  went
to the summit. This peak is in Canada and the maps and  contours  in  metric
units hard to read,  but  we  all  agreed  it  had  at  least  500  feet  of
prominence.  My first Canadian summit! We were  back  in  camp  at  3:00  (8
miles, 4400 ft, 9 hrs). Mike and Matt left an hour later, while Beth  and  I
relaxed, gloating over our  success  and  at  not  having  to  leave.  After
dinner, I decided to take a hike N along the ridge. I had in the back of  my
mind going all the way to Nepopekum Mtn, but it ended up being farther  than
it looked on the Canadian map. I just  couldn\'t  read  those  maps  properly
particularly because I couldn\'t figure out the scale. But it was a  gorgeous
snowfree ramble along the ridge through  flower  meadows.  I  turned  around
after a couple of miles and 750 ft gain.  I figured I was still an  hour  or
so from the peak at 7:45 and just didn\'t have enough time to get there.

Day 3: There was a heavy dew in the morning, getting everything wet. We  had
a leisurely breakfast trying to dry out our tents before  leaving  at  7:55.
At the first big blowdown we headed down through the woods thinking we  were
cutting only one switchback. Somehow we missed a whole series  of  them  and
ended up descending over a thousand feet before  hitting  the  trail  again.
But it all worked to our advantage as the going was easy and we  missed  the
worst of the blowdowns. I am sure we saved a lot  of  time  and  effort.  We
reached the car at 11:20 (8.5 miles, 350 ft, 3:25 hrs).

Grand Total: 29 miles and 10, 200 ft in 3 days

At the last minute I decided to  join  Jim  Brisbine  on  his  trip  when  I
learned he planned a 4-day  Blum-Hagan-Bacon-Watson  one-way  traverse.  But
since I had just done Bacon and Watson the previous week (we chuckled  about
great minds thinking alike), I would only do Blum and Hagan, taking  3  days
and coming out the same way we went in.  I wasn\'t sure I could be  ready  to
go again in one day after doing Hozomeen, but I couldn\'t resist having  good
company for two peaks I was planning on doing anyway and I found you can  do
most anything if you really want to. Besides, Beth also only had one day  to
get ready after Hozomeen.  If she could do it surely I could too.

Day 1: I stopped in  Sedro  Woolley  for  a  North  Cascades  National  Park
backcountry camping permit, then drove to the Baker River TH (elev  800  ft)
at the end of the Baker Lake Road where I met Jim, Eileen, Beth  and  Steve.
It took them longer than anticipated to run the car shuttle to the  Anderson
Lake TH (their exit point), so it was almost 2:00 by the time we started  up
the trail. We hiked Â½ mile upstream, crossed the Baker River  on  the  large
bridge, went downstream to just before the bridge over Blum Cr  and  plunged
into the forest casting around for the way trail to Blum  Lakes.  Eventually
we stumbled upon it. This way trail is difficult to follow in places,  rough
and very steep. We kept losing it and having to wander  around  to  find  it
again. Then somewhere around 3000 ft was a several hundred-foot  section  of
horrid recent blowdowns that was a nightmare to get through. Heat and  heavy
packs added to the slow progress. Be aware that this route  is  totally  dry
until the lakes and all water must be carried from the  bottom.  To  make  a
long unpleasant story short, it took 7 Â¼ -8.5 hrs to reach the lakes.  Steve
and I arrived first and were able to find a  level  spot  to  camp  on  snow
before it got dark. Another party of four was already camped  at  the  first
lake and occupied the only bare ground. We chatted briefly with  them.  They
were doing the same traverse and had done no better than we  had  coming  up
the ridge time wise, but had gotten a much earlier start. The  rest  of  our
party straggled in after dark guided by shouts  and  headlamps.  All  anyone
wanted was a quick dinner and to crash in sleeping bags. Not  an  auspicious
start. We wondered what other surprises were in store for us on  this  trip!
(3 miles, 4500 ft, 7:15 hrs)

Day 2: After the previous tough and late  day,  everyone  slept  in.  I  was
planning on returning to the lakes for  a  second  night,  so  took  only  a
daypack. The others had to break camp and carry full packs.  From  our  camp
we first had to cross Blum Cr, which was running high. I  found  a  rock  to
cross on.  The others jumped a narrow spot between snow  banks  after  first
throwing packs across. From the second higher lake, we climbed a snow  gully
to Upper Blum Lk and another gully to slightly below a saddle on  the  ridge
where full packs were left. The ridge itself was  rocky  and  pinnacled  and
not climbable, so we took a series of rocky ledges through  the  cliff  band
on the left to the easy snow slopes above and the summit (2850 ft,  4  hrs).
Here we met up with the other party, who had left about an hour  before  us.
Views were gorgeous and we spent a pleasant hour on top.

We dropped down to where the full packs had been left,  climbed  up  to  the
ridge saddle and followed the ridge toward Hagan. The big  obstacle  in  the
way was Pt 6800. To get  around  this  rocky  point,  we  dropped  a  couple
hundred feet into the basin above Berdeen Lk. We were helped  by  the  party
ahead of us and their tracks.  Even so I found this descent a bit tricky  in
places, even with just a daypack and the others did it with full  packs!  We
then climbed to the notch S of Pt 6800  and  easy  slopes  to  the  base  of
Hagan\'s main S Pk. The party of 4 was setting  up  camp  at  the  col  here.
Darn, no more tracks to follow. Worried about the growing lateness  and  the
need to get back to my camp at the lakes, I had pulled ahead of the rest  of
my group. After donning crampons, I started up the short steep  snow  finger
to the notch left of the summit rocks. After a tiptoe along the top  of  the
moat and a wiggle between snow and rock, I crossed the notch to the  S  side
where a series of fun class 3+ ledges led to the top at 6:45 (4050 ft,  8:30
hrs). I found two soggy barely legible film can registers. Beth reached  the
summit as I was leaving, just in time to take my picture. I passed  everyone
else on the way down and said my goodbyes.

From the base of the snow finger, it only took an  hour  on  a  surprisingly
easy and direct route back to camp. I did, however, have to  wade  icy  Blum
Cr to get across, as the water was considerably higher than in the  morning.
I reached my tent at 8:30 and had  enough  daylight  left  for  a  leisurely
dinner (7 miles, 4100 ft, 10:15 hrs).

Day 3: I slept in again, waiting for the sun to hit my tent at 8:00. It  had
been a cold clear night with heavy dew. I left at 10:00 and was not  looking
forward to the trip down the ridge. It was as bad as expected. I did  manage
to find the "trail" but I kept losing it and having to search around for  it
again. It was particularly bad at the blowdowns. I would  say  that  without
my GPS waypoints and "breadcrumb" trail that I had marked on the way  up,  I
never would have been able to find my way down. Whenever I  lost  the  trail
my GPS would tell me which way to look for it  again.  And  as  bad  as  the
trail was it was infinitely better than nothing, as  I  consistently  proved
when I got off route. So I took my time making sure I never got too far  off
the track, went slowly on the rough terrain and took many rests. I ended  up
taking almost as long to go down as it had  to  go  up,  but  I  did  do  it
safely, which was the most important thing. I reached the car  at  5:00  and
had a refreshing wash in the Baker River before leaving. (3 miles,  350  ft,
7 hrs).

Footnote: It turns out the continuing traverse for the  rest  of  the  party
took an unexpected turn when Jim made a misstep, broke his ankle and had  to
be helicoptered off the saddle between Hagan and Bacon.  But  I  will  leave
it to Jim to tell that tale.

Armed with the knowledge provided by Jim Brisbine\'s July 15,  2002  TR  that
this is a long one-day climb with at least one roped  pitch,  I  decided  to
take two days. Even so I got back after dark on my second  day,  although  I
had a few surprises causing unexpected delays.  Still,  how  Jim,  and  most
other people, do it in one day is beyond me.

Day 1: The last time I had been up the Trout Cr Rd  was  February  27,  2001
when I skied to Iron Mtn. The road was in terrible  shape  then  but  I  had
managed to get up it 1.2 miles in my Jeep. It is in  much  worse  shape  now
and I didn\'t even try driving it,  instead  starting  from  the  North  Fork
Skykomish River Rd at 10:00, elev 860 ft. After .9 mile I took a  left  onto
a spur road that is  now  so  washed  out,  rocky  and  rutted  that  it  is
virtually impassible to any wheeled vehicle. With a full pack,  I  struggled
up what was more like a stream bed than a road on this very  hot  and  muggy
day. It didn\'t seem to me much better than the previous  day  that  had  set
records for high temperatures all over Western Washington.  By  the  time  I
reached the end of the spur at 4200 ft (4 miles, 3400 ft, 4:15  hrs)  I  and
everything I was wearing was dripping wet and I couldn\'t seem to drink  fast
enough to replace the sweat that  was  streaming  from  every  pore.  I  was
beginning to think this whole trip was a bad idea. I could have stayed  home
in a relatively cool home reading a good book and sipping an iced drink.  At
least there were no bugs, not yet anyway.

From the end of the road I  went  straight  up  through  a  semi-brushy  old
clearcut to the 4700 ft saddle SE of Iron Mtn. Here a  remarkably  good  way
trail, though somewhat brushy in spots,  followed  up  and  down  along  the
crest of the ridge all  the  way  to  Conglomerate  Pt.  There  was  a  nice
register on top but it had been  placed  in  2006  and  only  had  two  solo
entries.  One person had also climbed Iron and was on his way to  Spire.   I
wonder if he knew what was in store for him?

From Conglomerate Pt I continued following the way  trail  along  the  ridge
toward Spire as it dropped to a first saddle at 5200 ft.  On a  level  bench
below this saddle I found a pleasant spot to camp with  running  water  from
snowpatches (6 miles, 4800 ft, 7:15 hrs). It was only 5:30 so I  had  plenty
of time to rest and rehydrate. Things were looking up.

Day 2: Just as I was ready to go at 6:45 it began to sprinkle  out  of  what
appeared to be a mostly blue sky. Where on earth did this  come  from?  Well
thunderstorms had been predicted as a possibility for  overnight,  but  they
were supposed to be dry thunderstorms and clear out early. For the  rest  of
the morning one fast moving thundershower after another passed through  very
quickly, but  they  never  amounted  to  much,  never  required  putting  on
raingear and were always followed by warm sunshine.

From camp I regained the ridge, climbed to  a  second  5520  ft  saddle  and
traversed to the right around the cliffs of Spire Mtn 6065 ft  BM.  Once  on
the E side, snow slopes provided easy travel  to  just  below  the  5640  ft
saddle with Spire Mtn proper. The snow  was  hard  enough,  though,  that  I
donned crampons for better footing. Next a descent to 5000 ft  was  required
to skirt below cliffs before an upward traverse, again  all  on  easy  snow,
could resume toward the main peak. It was all such pleasant  terrain  and  I
was having such a good time that I was surprised when I looked behind me  to
notice a fast approaching black  wall  of  weather.   This  looked  serious,
unlike the previous brief  benign  squalls.  Sure  enough,  just  as  I  was
approaching the notch NW of the summit the storm hit. And it was  a  doozey.
Within minutes the temperature plummeted, the wind kicked up, the rain  fell
in big wet drops and fog  engulfed  everything  limiting  visibility  to  50
feet. And then came the thunder and lightening. I couldn\'t have  been  in  a
worse place. First order of business was to put on warmer clothes  and  rain
gear. Already I was freezing.  Wasn\'t I sweltering in sunshine just  minutes
ago? I am not sure I have ever witnessed a faster change of  weather  in  my
life.

So what to do? Things were looking bleak indeed and at that moment I  feared
my climb was over. But I am ever the optimist.  All  the  other  storms  had
passed by quickly.  Maybe this one would also. But I knew that  even  if  it
did, I still might not be able to make the climb, as the rock would  now  be
all wet. In the end I decided to hunker down in a protected spot  and  wait,
hoping against hope. And sure enough after an hour or so, the  storm  passed
and just as quickly the sun came out and all was right with the world  again
- except that now everything was wet. Well no way to tell  how  things  were
except to go take a look.

I climbed the last bit to the notch and plunged into the  scrub  trees  that
initially guarded the summit ridge. This section was easy  if  wet,  but  at
this point I was in summit mode and barely noticed. Above at  a  flat  place
on the ridge, I put on my harness and left my pack, taking  only  my  ropes,
pro and a fanny pack that included my cell phone (just  in  case).  A  short
ways on I came to the narrow, steep exposed section of the  ridge  mentioned
by Jim. Here I roped up.  In order to save weight I had  brought  an  80  ft
climbing rope and an 80 ft 5 mm rope, which together would allow for  an  80
ft rappel. I had thought 80 feet would get me past the step. It  didn\'t.   I
ended up doing two pitches. The first pitch was short  and  got  me  to  the
base of the crux move. The second pitch went the full length  of  my  80  ft
rope and got to easy scramble terrain again. I had a devil of a time  making
the crux move. I went up a crack slightly left of the  crest  and  a  multi-
slung rappel horn, and it took me a long time to figure out  the  moves  and
to get up the nerve to go for it.  Also, I had  inadvertently  neglected  to
bring my solo belay device, so had to make do with  the  low-tech  technique
of multiple overhand knots.  This works but  lengthens  any  fall  over  the
solo device if a slip occurs, and I was very aware of this.  All  this  took
time but at least by now the rock had dried and that was not an issue.

Above the step, I abandoned my rope and  scrambled  the  rest  of  the  way,
going over a small false summit, reaching the top at 12:30 (2.5 miles,  2300
ft, 5:45 hrs). I was very disappointed not to find any summit  register  and
practically dismantled the cairn looking for one.  There  had  been  one  in
2002 when Jim had climbed the peak. I wanted  to  read  about  Stefan\'s  and
Mike T\'s ascents and Mike C\'s and Don B\'s solo ascents for myself. Also  now
I didn\'t know if the fellow who signed in on Conglomerate Pt  actually  made
it to here. I only had an emergency matchbox register  with  me  but  I  did
leave that.

I didn\'t dally on top, knowing I had lost a lot of time, had a long  way  to
go to get out today and worried another storm could  hit  at  any  time  (it
never did). I got down with downclimbing and two 80 ft rappels. Despite  the
late hour, I took the time on the way back to climb to the top of Spire  Mtn
BM. Although lacking 400 ft clean prominence (but only by 15 ft), it  is  an
impressive mountain in its own right, very cliffy on  the  SW  slope  and  a
nice viewpoint. A short class  3  gully  with  curious  imbedded  old  wired
wooden stakes led to the summit at 4:00. I also found a large roll  of  wire
on top (from the surveyors?)  It was  worth  the  side  trip  just  for  the
spectacular shot of Spire Mtn above a sea of fog. You can  clearly  see  why
it is called Spire Mountain, with  the  Central  toothlike  Spire  the  most
impressive.

I reached camp at 5:00 (5 miles, 3600 ft, 10:15 hrs RT), had  a  short  rest
and left at 6:00, more or driven out by droves  of  (newly  hatched?)  bugs.
They plaqued me the rest of the day, my first really bad  bug  encounter  of
the season. I reached the road at 7:45 and the car at 10:00  (6  miles,  700
ft, 4 hrs from camp), needing my headlamp only for last  half  hour  or  so.
Despite taking 2 days, I really didn\'t get down much earlier than  Jim,  who
had done his one day climb from 7 am to 11 pm.

Grand Total: 17 miles and 9100 ft in two days

Day 1: After getting the proper permit for camping  in  the  North  Cascades
National Park at Marblemount, I started up the Lookout  Mtn  trail  off  the
Cascade River Road (elev 1250 ft) at  noon.  What  a  nice  trail  this  is,
climbing steadily in lovely mossy forest. A  cool  breeze  made  the  upward
trudge as pleasant as possible and I was even  enjoying  myself,  despite  a
pack heavy with climbing gear, until I was stung on the leg by a  bee.  That
brought me back to earth while the pain  slowly  subsided.  Then  the  black
flies began to make an appearance as the day  heated  up  and  my  enjoyment
lessened in direct proportion to their increase.

The trail was  in  great  shape  except  for  one  blowdown  shortly  before
crossing a creek near the Monogram Lake Trail junction. As I was  making  my
way around the top of it, I heard a pitiful voice calling from above  asking
if I were on the trail. "Not at the moment", I replied, "but it is  not  far
away." Then out of the brush appeared a somewhat  worse-for-the-wear  fellow
exclaiming that he had lost the trail and spent the last 3  hours  wandering
around. He had tried  going  straight  uphill  to  intersect  the  trail  to
Monogram Lake, had gotten into very steep terrain, given up  and  come  back
down. Now I admit I have experienced blowdowns where it is possible or  even
easy to lose the trail, but this was not one of them. On a  scale  of  1  to
10, this one was maybe a 2. You could see the trail on the  other  side  for
goodness sake! How on earth could he lose it? And why on earth,  instead  of
searching harder for it, would he head uphill where the trail  was  1400  ft
above him by the route he was taking? Yes, you meet some strange  people  in
the wilderness.

Safely back on the trail and, I suppose, not wanting to lose the comfort  of
another human being immediately, I couldn\'t shake this fellow. He  stuck  to
me like glue as we both took the trail to Monogram  Lake,  talking  non-stop
the whole time. I learned more than I ever wanted to know about him  -  like
how he had just broken up with  his  girlfriend  (maybe  he  talked  her  to
death?). He did have a sense of humor, however, noting how he had started  3
hours earlier than I (at 9am) and we were now both in the same place. But  I
was grateful I wasn\'t going to the Lake (his destination) and could take  my
leave at 5000 ft where the trail crossed the creek again in  an  open  basin
(4 miles, 3600 ft, 4 hrs).

I climbed up steep meadows to cross a spur ridge at 6100 ft  just  S  of  Pt
6438. Note that this point is shown as 6708 ft on the Big  Devil  Quad  with
400 feet of very close contours.  I  had  puzzled  over  this  anomaly  when
studying the map. If these contours  were  correct  this  would  be  a  very
noticeable spire and most likely have a name and climbing  history.  It  had
neither. Also Beckey and the GT Marblemount map lists the elevation as  6438
ft. This is the correct elevation and there is  no  spire.   I  mention  all
this just to show how wrong a map can be. Why the  USGS  Quad  lists  it  as
having been surveyed at 6708 ft I have no idea.  Maybe  the  surveyors  were
drunk or the map-making equipment ran amok making  contour  lines.  I  found
other anomalies on this quad but they were less obvious.

From the ridge I began  a  delightful  traverse  on  heather  benches  above
Monogram Lake. Along the way I crossed countless creeks and found dozens  of
suitable places to camp all with fantastic views of  the  Snowking  Mountain
and Cascade Pass areas.  I was tempted to stop here to  camp  but  I  really
wanted to be closer to Little Devil so I kept going. As I rounded the  ridge
coming off of Pt 6844 I feared I made an error as I  left  the  sunny  green
meadows and entered a world of bleak and shadowed snow and rock. However,  I
ended up finding a wonderful campsite on smooth, level  bedrock  slabs  near
an ice lake just below the permanent snowfield S of Little Devil, elev  6000
ft (6 miles, 5200 ft, 7 hrs).

Day 2: I was up and going by 7:15. I climbed gentle snow to the saddle W  of
Little Devil and followed the ridge easily to  the  summit  (1000  ft,  1:10
hr). I found no register although  I  know  that  Janet  had  been  up  here
earlier this year (in one day). From the top  I  had  a  great  view  of  my
destination and all surrounding peaks.

Next up was Baksit (Middle Devil). It was only  about  Â½  mile  away  but  I
could not follow the ridge from Little Devil.   I  could  see  a  relatively
easy route that entailed dropping a few hundred feet  to  get  past  cliffs.
This I did with little difficulty and I was on the summit at 10:00 (1550,  3
hrs). I had an even better view of my peaks  and  my  route  to  them  along
jagged Teebone Ridge. My oh my but they looked a long  ways  off.  I  wasn\'t
sure I could even get to Big Devil much less The Trapezoid. I had  hoped  to
also climb Fallen Angel, which looked very impressive and appealing. I  even
had rock climbing gear with me, but I was now sure I wouldn\'t have time  for
it.  It would have to wait for another trip.

I had to backtrack a short ways along the S ridge of Baksit before  I  could
drop E onto moderate snow and traverse to the 6700  ft  saddle  with  Fallen
Angel. From this saddle I dropped again down steep snow, using crampons,  to
about 6000 ft and began a long traverse on the S slopes  of  Teebone  Ridge.
The going was easy enough - even enjoyable - but very  slow,  up  and  down,
across snow, scree, talus and heather. The main obstacle  was  crossing  the
low point in the ridge just NW of Pt 6154. This turned  out  to  be  a  very
deep rocky notch at 5900 ft. I ended up too high and cliffbound, and had  to
backtrack a bit to work my way steeply down.  Once  across  the  notch,  the
terrain opened up again but the last part still was  farther  away  than  it
looked and took longer than expected. I mostly followed  the  crest  of  the
ridge on easy rock, avoiding steep heather gullies, but  several  times  got
stopped by short walls I  had  to  work  my  way  across.  I  surprised  two
mountain goats in this area.  I  finally  pulled  onto  the  broad  heathery
summit of Big Devil at 2:25 (3000 ft, 7 hrs).

I found a film can register with only two entries - Don Goodman  on  8/28/99
and Stefan, Mike C and Dave Creeden on 3/13/05. Both those parties had  come
up from the Skagit River to the N. Views were  to  die  for,  but  I  mostly
couldn\'t take my eyes off The Trapezoid (Last Devil).  I really wanted  this
peak but it was getting late, it was over a mile away, would add 2000 ft  of
elevation gain and the last few hundred  feet  was  Beckey  class  3,  which
could mean class 4. I waffled for  30  minutes  while  I  rested,  before  I
decided to go for it even though I knew this meant I would get back to  camp
after dark. Fortunately the approach along the ridge was easy and fast  snow
and heather and I reached the notch on the W ridge in slightly more than  an
hour. I left my pack, taking only my rope and scrambled up class 3+ rock  to
the summit (4000 ft, 9:10 hrs). I left the  last  of  the  registers  I  had
brought with me. I did not use the rope but I saw if you got off  route  you
could easily be in class 4 or worse territory.

I was elated to make the entire traverse of Teebone Ridge, but  now  reality
was setting in. What had I gotten myself into? It was now 4:30 and I  had  a
long, long way to go, much of it uphill. Best not to think too  much.   Just
do it. First I had to climb almost up to the  summit  of  Big  Devil  again.
There was no short cut. Then the steep descent down to  the  notch  where  I
did better job finding a way across. Then the long  traverse  below  Teebone
Ridge and the steep snow climb (crampons again) to the Fallen  Angel  saddle
and Baksit Ridge.  By now I was losing light but an almost full moon  helped
immensely especially on the reflective snow.  It  was  actually  a  gorgeous
evening and if I weren\'t so tired I would have enjoyed  it  greatly.  I  set
down my black gloves taking off my crampons  to  cross  a  short  rock  band
descending off Baksit, and forgot them in the dark.  Darn!  I  really  liked
those gloves. Another climb up snow to  Little  Devil  Saddle  and  a  final
stagger down to camp where I ended  up  needing  my  headlamp  the  last  15
minutes as I entered a fogbank and lost the moonlight. I reached my tent  at
10:40 (12 miles, 6200 ft, 15:30 hrs) too tired to do  more  than  make  soup
and tea before falling asleep.

Day 3: I slept in and left camp at 9:45. All thoughts of  going  up  Lookout
Mtn on the way out were forgotten, but I did drop directly down to  Monogram
Lake and took the trail out from there. That really saved no time  and  even
added extra elevation gain (the trail drops 500 ft to the lake), but  it  is
a lovely lake and I was able to take a quick dip (quick being the  operative
word as the water was icy cold).  I reached the car at 3:45  (6  miles,  750
ft, 6 hrs) just as 3 fellows were starting up the trail.  I  wondered  where
they planned to camp starting so late and if they  knew  it  would  take  at
least 5 hours to get to the  lake.  I  left  them  to  their  fate  as  they
solicited no information and so I offered none.

Luna Peak (8311 ft - 3071P - Mt Challenger Quad) - July 31-August 4, 2007


I had never been to the Pickets before, never even been  close,  never  even
had a really good look from afar, so this trip was completely new  territory
for me. I had heard numerous horror stories  about  how  all  approaches  to
this area are horrendous and always  take  longer  than  anticipated,  so  I
allowed a generous 5 days for the climb. Some people do  it  in  3  days.  I
don\'t see how they do it. I was delighted when  my  good  friend  Linda  was
available to join me. We hadn\'t done a long trip together for a while and  I
always enjoy climbing with her. We had perfect weather the  whole  time  and
it ended up being a wonderful adventure.

Day 1: We arrived at the Ross Lake TH  (elev  2100  ft)  above  the  dam  at
10:20, hiked 1 mile down to the water taxi dock (elev 1600  ft)  and  called
on the resort phone there to confirm our arrival for our  prearranged  12:00
pick-up to be ferried across the lake to the Big Beaver  TH.   The  cost  is
now $35 each way for up to 6 people but saves 6 miles  of  hiking.  We  were
picked up a bit early and began hiking the Big Beaver trail at  11:40.  This
trail is in very good shape climbing very slowly with a few  ups  and  downs
and is mostly in cool mossy forest with some very impressive  giant  cedars.
I hiked in light trail shoes carrying boots. This saved  my  feet  wear  and
tear but added to an already heavy  pack.  We  had  a  few  encounters  with
annoying bugs, both mosquitoes and black flies. We arrived at pleasant  Luna
Camp, elev 2500 ft, at 5:00 (10 miles, 1300 ft, 5:20  hrs)  with  plenty  of
time to wash up and relax before turning in early. We had the  camp  all  to
ourselves, met only two people on the trail on the way in and  in  fact  saw
no one for the next 3 days.

Day 2: We stashed some food at Luna Camp for the return  (why  carry  it  up
just to carry it back down?) before starting the next morning  at  8:00.  We
hiked about Â½ mile up trail to  just  past  a  small  creek  before  heading
straight downhill to cross Big Beaver Cr on a huge logjam.  Many  thanks  go
to Don Goodman for reporting the location of this  logjam.  Without  knowing
where it was we could have wandered around for hours searching for a way  to
cross. The crossing was easy but getting to it was not. The creek bottom  is
an awful jungle of swamp and brush.

Once across we headed diagonally uphill  through  moderate  brush  until  we
could hear Access Cr, then followed the left (S) side of  that  creek  until
coming to a large brush patch that forced us  to  cross  to  the  right  (N)
side. We crossed again at about 3700 ft, really too soon,  and  got  into  a
mess of brush.  The correct crossing  is  higher,  about  3900  ft,  and  is
easier to find on the way out (which we did). The rest of the way, once  out
of the brush, is on large talus.  Be aware that the route up  Access  Cr  is
very slow travel and takes much longer than one  might  think.  It  look  us
7:30 hrs, although we did take our time, took several long rests and made  a
few route-finding errors. We found a marvelous campsite in  the  open  basin
at 4300 ft (4 miles, 2100 ft, 7:30 hrs) and opted to stay there even  though
we had the time to go farther. We had a great view of the rocky  E  face  of
Luna Pk above and of Mt Prophet across the valley. Bugs were tolerable.

Day 3:  We were on our way at 7:00 with light daypacks, climbing up an  easy
gully on the left (S) side of the  basin.  At  the  top  of  this  gully  we
climbed another gully to the right to a 6200 ft notch. The upper part  still
had snow in it that was quite steep near the top where we did use  crampons.
At the notch (1900 ft, 2 hrs)  we  had  our  first  fantastic  view  of  the
southern Pickets. They certainly  are  aptly  named,  looking  just  like  a
picket fence with rugged spire after spire.

From the notch we  went  uphill  on  steep  heather  until  we  could  begin
traversing west across the basin on the south side of Luna, but we  got  too
high and had some difficulty crossing a notch and gully at  about  6600  ft.
Fortunately we did find a way across without having to backtrack, but it  is
best to drop at the start below  a  cliff  band  to  about  6200  ft  before
beginning the traverse. Once past this cliffy area the rest of the  gorgeous
traverse, always in sight of the southern Pickets, is  fairly  easy  heather
and snow to the 7200 ft notch on Luna\'s SW ridge (3100 ft, 4:45  hrs).  Here
we had our first view of the northern Pickets,  including  Mt  Fury  and  Mt
Challenger. Spectacular!

After stashing crampons and ice  axes,  we  climbed  up  easy,  if  somewhat
unpleasant, talus, scree and loose rock on the SW ridge and S  face  to  the
false  summit  at  1:20  (4100  ft,  6  hrs).   The  view  from   here   was
indescribable on this perfect weather day. To the right were  the  whole  of
the northern Pickets and to the left the whole of southern Pickets.  It  was
almost more than the mind could take in at one time  and  we  reveled  in  a
sight few are privileged to see.

But we were not yet on the true summit. This loomed a  very  short  distance
to the N along a narrow exposed very intimidating looking  ridge.  We  roped
up on our short 100 ft rope and I set out along  the  ridge.  At  first  all
went well and seemed it wouldn\'t be as bad as it had looked.  Then  about  a
rope length out I tried to pass a coffee table sized block  perched  on  the
crest and the whole thing tottered. It and the rock it was resting  on  were
both loose and threatened to tumble over the  rotten  edge  taking  me  with
them. I absolutely freaked thinking the whole  ridge  would  be  like  that,
backed off and looked for an alternate route. I know there is one on  the  W
side, but it is accessed from lower down and we really couldn\'t  get  to  it
now from where we were. However, on the E side were a series of wide  ledges
that looked as if they would go. So we dropped about 50-100 ft  down  the  E
side and worked our way along these ledges back up to the ridge.  This  took
5-6 belayed and protected pitches with our short  rope  and  a  considerable
amount of time but we did make it to the true summit (4200 ft, 8:30 hr)  and
it was actually rather fun climbing.

From the summit, the ridge back to the false summit looked so close that  we
returned that way. It was actually much easier than it  had  looked  before,
with part of it being on a nice ledge just below the crest. When I  came  to
the freaky teetering  rock  again,  I  was  able  to  trundle  some  of  the
underlying loose rocks and stabilize things a bit,  at  least  enough  so  I
could get by it. That  was  actually  the  worst  part  of  the  ridge,  and
although it did make one question the stability of the rest of the ridge,  I
found the rest of the climbing rather enjoyable.  It  certainly  was  faster
than the lower ledge route and we were back to the false summit in an  hour,
at 5:00. Now we would have to hustle to get back to camp before dark.

We did make it before dark, but just barely.  We  corrected  a  few  of  our
route-finding errors of the way up, which speeded things up,  but  then  ran
into rock-hard snow (and terrible bugs) descending from the  6200  ft  notch
and had to front-point down, which slowed things down again. We pulled  into
camp at 9:00 (6 miles, 4400 ft, 14 hrs) with just enough light to  navigate.
Although tired, we washed up and had a good  dinner  enjoying  the  now  bug
free, mild and moonlit night.

Day 4: We slept in and awoke to clouds and high mountain fog. The summit  of
Luna was no longer visible from camp. We were so happy to have had  a  clear
day for our summit. To have missed all those spectacular  views  would  have
verged on unbearable. Since our goal for the day was to  just  get  back  to
Luna Camp, we were in no particular hurry  and  started  down  at  9:45.  We
found the proper upper crossing of Access  Cr  (it  was  marked  by  several
cairns) and avoided some of the worst brush we had wallowed through  on  the
way up. We stayed on the N side of the creek  until  about  3200  ft  before
crossing to the S side, stumbling upon a convenient log at  just  the  right
spot. Some brush was unavoidable. We then traversed high  above  Big  Beaver
Creek before coming out  right  at  the  logjam  (I  had  marked  the  exact
location on my GPS). Another 30  minutes  of  jungle  bashing  was  required
before we hit the trail. 15 minutes after that  we  were  in  Luna  Camp  (4
miles, 150 ft, 5:30 hrs) where our food cache was still safely  hanging.  It
was only a little after 3:00 but our  permit  was  for  Luna  Camp.   Had  I
thought more about it, I probably should have made the  last  night  for  39
mile Camp so we had less to go the next day. But  we  were  not  unhappy  to
stop early and we enjoyed a leisurely afternoon.  Once  again  we  had  Luna
Camp all to ourselves (there are only two campsites there).

Day 5: We were up and going by 7:30. We  had  10  miles  to  go  before  our
scheduled pickup at 1:20 and we didn\'t want to miss the  boat.  Shortly  out
of camp we met a ranger. She was friendly enough but  still  looked  at  our
permit. She said another party was supposed to have been camped at Luna  the
previous night. It was probably the party we were to  share  the  boat  ride
with. We hoped they were okay.

Somewhere past 39 Mile Camp we ran into a scruffy  looking  guy  dressed  in
camouflage and toting a high-powered scoped rifle. I  was  totally  startled
by such an encounter and at first couldn\'t figure  out  what  he  was  doing
there. Was he a psycho bent on doing harm? Turns out it  was  the  start  of
bear hunting season and since we were then in the Ross Lake Recreation  Area
and not the National Park anymore, it  was  all  legal,  but  it  was  still
disconcerting if not downright disturbing. A little farther on we came  upon
a fresh cigarette butt in the middle of the trail that had  burned  down  to
the filter, and obviously had not been put out before being  flicked  aside.
Then we smelled smoke. Smoke? Where was that from? The  smell  got  stronger
and stronger until rounding a corner of the trail, maybe  a  mile  from  the
hunter, we came upon an open flame burning some 8 inches high in  a  rotting
stump by the side of the trail. Now  Linda  has  had  firefighting  training
with the DNR and knew what to do and we spent the next  20  minutes  putting
the fire out. It had burned quite a ways into the  stump  and  could  easily
have spread farther, especially if a wind  had  kicked  up.  We  figure  the
cigarette smoker had sat on the stump smoking  and  just  tossed  the  still
smoldering butt aside. We saw no one else  other  than  the  hunter  in  the
vicinity.  You connect the dots.

Despite our delay putting out the fire, we still made the  dock  (10  miles,
600 ft, 5 hrs) in plenty of time to catch the  boat,  which  came  right  on
schedule at 1:20. We even had time  for  a  refreshing  dip  in  Ross  Lake.
Shortly after we arrived, a very nice couple from Salt Lake City showed  up.
They were the ones that were supposed to be at Luna Camp the  night  before.
They had only made it to Beaver Pass. They had  been  on  a  6-day  trip  up
Little Beaver to Whatcom Pass, Perfect Pass,  Challenger  Arm  and  out  Big
Beaver. It all took longer than they had expected.  Sharing  the  boat  ride
made the cost much more reasonable. We  all  could  have  done  without  the
final mile and 500 ft climb up to the parking lot and car at the  other  end
of the boat ride.

Grand total: 36 miles and 9050 ft in 5 days

Cascade Mtn, N Pk (5553 ft - 873P - Grotto Quad) - August 15, 2007


I tried this peak earlier in the year but was thwarted by not being able  to
cross the rushing West Fork Miller River. I had  no  such  problem  on  this
day. I parked at the gate across the old West Fork Miller  road  (elev  1300
ft). This road has deteriorated to the point  where  it  has  many  bouldery
stretches that would make it virtually impossible to  bike  and  even  makes
for difficult hiking at times. At about  2.5  miles  where  the  road  comes
close to the river and  near  where  the  outlet  creek  from  Francis  Lake
intersects, I found an easy crossing  on  rocks.  After  a  short  but  very
brushy section on the other side, I entered trees and followed  the  rib  on
the left (E) of the outlet creek. If you can find  it  and  stay  on  it,  a
faint fisherman\'s trail leads all the way to Francis  Lake.  I  lost  it  in
dense huckleberry bushes about 500 ft below the lake, ended up too high  and
too far E but still managed to find a way to the NE ridge of my peak.

From the ridge, a pleasant traverse on talus  and  heather  on  the  W  side
below a pinnacle led to a notch just N of the summit. The final  ascent  was
easy scrambling on the E side (4400 ft, 5:15 hrs). I found  no  register  so
left one of mine.  On the way down, I descended directly to the  lake  (some
cliffs to avoid) and went  around  it  on  the  W  side.  I  picked  up  the
fisherman\'s trail at the outlet.  Note that the outlet creek  is  not  where
it is indicated on the USGS map but is farther E out  of  the  lake  arm.  I
again lost the trail on the way down,  ended  up  cliff  bound  and  had  to
ascend a bit to get back on track. The trail takes a turn to the E to  avoid
these cliffs. Others have made this same mistake as I  came  across  fishing
gear (pole, paddles, sleeping pad, plates, etc) that was  abandoned  at  the
top of the cliffs.  I found no body attached so I  assume  whoever  left  it
eventually made it out okay. I  followed  the  trail  lower  down  until  it
disappeared in river bottom brush. Floundering blindly through this  section
I hit the river in a different place than on the way up  with  no  rocks  to
cross and rather than crash more brush looking for a better  spot  I  simply
waded (waist deep but calm) across - boots, pants and all.  It  felt  rather
refreshing on this warm day and I didn\'t even mind  squishing  out  dripping
wet.

Total: 9 miles, 4700 ft and 10 hrs.

Anderson Butte (5720+ ft - 880P) & Bacon5 (5040+ ft - 640P) - Bacon Pk  Quad
- August 26, 2007

After over a week of inactivity, I  was  desperate  to  get  out  despite  a
forecast of 50% chance rain. I decided to return to the unfinished  business
of Anderson Butte which I felt could be done in iffy weather. I  hadn\'t  had
time for it when I was in the area earlier  climbing  Bacon  and  Watson.  I
also planned to climb the nearby Bacon5 and maybe some others.

As soon as I left the Watson Lake TH at 10:30, it began to rain  and  rained
steadily until just before I got back to the car.  It  was  44  degrees  and
quite chilly. I took the trail to the Anderson Butte LO site leaving  it  at
the ridge saddle to climb to the main W ridge of the true summit. I  crossed
to the S and traversed on steep slick  wet  heather  below  rocky  pinnacles
until I could make my way to the high point. It was truly  lousy  weather  -
heavy rain, windy, zero visibility and, although the rest of  me  was  still
reasonably dry at this point, my hands were freezing  in  soaked  gloves.  I
left a register in the cairn and quickly retreated (1900 ft, 2 hrs).

For Bacon5, I crashed dripping brush and soggy marsh from  the  lower  trail
toward the saddle to the S, getting very wet in the process. Almost  to  the
saddle I came upon an old road, which I followed to its end  in  awful  head
high brush. I made my way as quickly as possible to forest which  was  steep
but offered reasonable travel. Bacon5 has 3 bumps on the ridge each  with  a
5040 ft contour. Going on the theory that the summit is ALWAYS the  farthest
bump, I headed to the N summit first. It had the best high  point  and  read
higher on my altimeter and that is where I left a register, but I picked  up
the other two bumps on the way out just to make sure. I found no  cairns  or
any other evidence of anyone having been  there.  I  descended  to  the  old
road, which led back to the TH. Even though it was still early and the  rain
had now finally stopped, the thought of crashing  any  more  wet  brush  was
decidedly not appealing and I called it  a  day,  passing  on  several  more
possible summits on the drive home.

Total: 6 miles, 3400 ft and 6 hrs.

On my climb of Luna last  month,  Elephant  Butte  dominated  views  up  Big
Beaver Cr and I became intrigued by that mountain. After a little  research,
I learned it could be approached from  "scenic"  (as  described  by  Beckey)
Stetattle Ridge and done solo. It seemed  the  perfect  trip  to  regain  my
mental balance after a tough couple weeks dealing with a family crisis.

Day 1: After obtaining a permit for the Sourdough Cross Country Zone in  the
North Cascades National Park, I easily found the Sourdough Mtn TH, elev  900
ft, in the tiny town of Diablo at 11:30. This is an excellent trail,  mostly
in cool forest, well maintained  and  with  a  grade  that  gains  elevation
rapidly. Before I knew it I was at the crossing of Sourdough Cr where I  was
to leave the trail at elev 4900  ft  (4.2  miles,  4000  ft,  3:15  hrs).  I
followed the spur to the camp area (two leveled campsites)  and  encountered
a little minor brush before it opened to meadows  and  talus  and  I  easily
gained the ridge to the left of the creek at  a  5480  ft  saddle.  A  short
class 2 rocky section soon gave  way  to  broad  heather,  flower  and  rock
gardens. "Scenic" doesn\'t begin to describe the beauty of this  ridge.  Just
past tarn 5916 I found a perfect spot  to  camp  with  a  gorgeous  view  of
Snowfield out my front door (5 miles, 4900 ft, 4:30 hrs). Out my  back  door
I could see the Southern Pickets and McMillian Spires across  Stetattle  Cr.
Although it was still early, I was afraid if I went farther  I  wouldn\'t  be
able to find any water. In fact there was no running water  even  here,  but
the tarn provided a surprisingly clean supply. After a little rest, I  hiked
the short distance to the high point of Sourdough Mtn (1 mile, 400  ft,  :50
hr RT), then leisurely ate dinner before turning in early.

Day 2: I awoke to a stunning sunrise over McMillian  Spires  and  a  setting
full moon. As I started along the long ridge toward Elephant Butte at  7:30,
I was absolutely floored by the scenery.  Stetattle Ridge has to be  one  of
the most beautiful ridges in all of Washington  and  you  know  how  I  love
ridges. So I was enjoying myself immensely as I ambled  along  the  friendly
terrain with gorgeous views in every direction. Much of the way had a  faint
trail, not that one was needed. You could wander most anywhere.  There  were
many ups and downs with rocky knobs and grassy  swales  and  hidden  notches
and little  tarns  here  and  there  to  cross,  but  travel  was  easy  and
absolutely delightful.

I reached the 6495 ft S Peak of the ridge at 8:50 and the 6728 ft N Peak  at
10:30 (4 miles, 1800 ft, 3 hrs). Neither had a register. To  experience  the
best of the ridge stop here. I had a great view of McMillian  Spires,  Fury,
Luna and Elephant Butte. The latter looked oh so  close  and  not  all  that
difficult, but it was very deceptive. In fact it was another  4  miles  away
and not all that easy to get to. There were  several  more  bumps  to  climb
over before making a major almost 2000 ft descent to the  saddle  E  of  the
Butte. The first part was straight forward but by trying to avoid  Pt  6154,
I started down too soon and ended up in a  mess  of  brushy  cliffs  and  an
awful traverse and didn\'t reach the 4900 ft saddle until 12:40.

There was more brush and hidden cliffs getting  out  of  the  saddle.  After
several hundred  feet  of  unpleasantness,  the  terrain  opened  up  again.
Reasonable travel prevailed until I reached  the  snowfield  below  a  cliff
band at 6400 ft. I was forced left to where I found a short  class  4  break
in the cliff that allowed me to gain the SE ridge. I followed this  ridge  a
short ways but could see it was likely I would soon be  stopped  by  notches
and cliffs. Beckey describes this ridge as class 3-4, but it  looked  harder
than that to me and I had no gear other than my 60 ft "panic" rope  and  two
slings. I was afraid to continue and instead  found  an  easy  way  off  the
ridge and a traverse W until  almost  directly  below  the  summit  where  I
climbed an awful loose gully back to the ridge again. I  thought  I  had  it
made. But at the last moment, about 50 feet from the summit I encountered  a
30 ft class 5 wall at a final notch. Darn, darn and triple darn!

Now there is an easy route up Elephant Butte from the W but  it  is  a  very
long traverse from the E past S cliffs to get to it  and  I  was  trying  to
avoid that.  In the end, though, that is probably what I should  have  done.
It would have saved time in the long run. But now I  was  stuck  just  below
the summit on the E ridge with time running out and no other option than  to
retreat or climb the  cliff  unprotected.  After  looking  at  all  possible
routes and weighing the risks, I climbed (without  my  pack)  a  deep  crack
with good holds and made it up the initial vertical 10 feet.  The  rest  was
easier and I triumphantly set foot on the summit at 4:30 (8 miles, 4700  ft,
9 hrs). There was a large cairn on top with a tiny  film  can  register.  It
recorded John Roper\'s Oct 14, 1978 climb where he  stated,  "it  is  farther
than it looks". You got that right John! The only other  entries  were  from
1960, 1962, 1966, 1974 and 1991. Surely others have climbed this  peak  more
recently. Maybe "he who removes all registers  from  North  Cascades  Peaks"
removed a more recent one and missed the film can. In any event  I  added  a
new register.

It was getting late and I knew I would be getting  back  after  dark  -  way
after dark - but just how "way after dark" it turned  out  to  be  surprised
even me. First I had to rappel the cliff (thank heavens for my panic  rope).
Then I tried a different way down than my loose awful  gully.  This  started
well on easy heather and scree until I came to a hidden cliff band  and  was
funneled into a steep gully-chimney where I did another couple  of  rappels.
I then did a much lower traverse below all the S side cliffs to get back  to
my up route, but had to do another rappel on the  brushy  cliffs  above  the
saddle. I reached the saddle at 8:20 just as it was  getting  dark.  I  went
straight up from the saddle almost to the summit of  Pt  6154,  zigging  and
zagging around cliffs but avoiding the horrid brush of the  way  down.  Then
everything became a bit of a blur as I slowly followed  the  ridge  back  in
the dark. It seemed to me I was always going up. A full moon helped keep  me
on track for the distant route but progress was a snail\'s pace.  Toward  the
end my LED headlamp seemed to be getting dim. Now when was it  that  I  last
changed batteries? Oh yes, for Big Devil. I really  should  have  added  new
ones for this trip. I finally dragged into a most welcome  looking  camp  at
2:30 am (16 miles, 8300 ft, 19 hrs). I was too tired to do more than have  a
tiny snack and drink a quart of liquid.

Day 3: I awoke at 7:30 to sun on my tent, much earlier  than  I  would  have
liked, but I couldn\'t get back to sleep. So I  ate  breakfast  and  finished
reading the book I had brought. Now it was 9:30. Much  too  early  to  leave
this lovely spot. What  to  do?   I  think  there  is  definitely  something
seriously wrong with me. Why  couldn\'t  I  just  lounge  around?  Instead  I
decided to climb Peak 6607 (Pumpkin Mtn Quad 1). But really the peak  didn\'t
look that hard. I descended 1000 ft to just above  Sourdough  Lake,  getting
into some brief bad brush near the low point. Once on the main SW  ridge  it
was easy going to the summit (2 miles, 1800 ft, 2:15  hrs).  A  small  cairn
was on top and I had a nice view of Stetattle  Ridge.  On  the  way  back  I
avoided the brush at the bottom by staying on the crest of the  ridge.  This
was better even though it had a short rock step. I was back in camp at  2:30
(4 miles, 3000 ft, 5 hrs). I left at 3:30, hit the trail  at  4:15  and  the
car at 6:30. Needless to say, I was totally wiped out  and  I  could  barely
walk anymore but I felt marvelous and completely rejuvenated.

Grand Total: 30 miles and 16,600 ft in 3 days

While climbing Majestic Mtn  last  year,  I  was  intrigued  by  a  striking
pyramid shaped peak framed at the head of the East Cr valley  to  the  right
of Mebee Pass. I later identified it as the Methow Pinnacles.  I  had  never
even heard of it before but knew I had to eventually go back and  climb  it.
Then I noticed there were two unnamed peaks of prominence on either side  of
the pass. My challenge would be to see if I could connect these three  peaks
in one horseshoe traverse high on connecting  ridges  without  running  into
undue difficulties with cliffs.

Day 1: The East Cr Trail has a spacious marked TH (elev  2600  ft)  off  the
North Cascades Hwy and is shown as a solid green line going all the  way  to
Mebee Pass on the 2003 Mt Logan GT map,  so  it  should  be  a  good  trail,
right? Wrong! This fact slowly  dawned  on  me  as  I  toiled  up  the  many
switchbacks at the beginning. This section goes through an  open  forest  of
weak spindly jack trees. I remembered from last  year  that  many  of  these
small trees had fallen across  the  trail  and  were  a  real  pain  to  get
through, but I had hopes that they had been logged out by now. Not only  had
the old ones not been logged out, but many new ones had also been  added  by
recent storms. Now admittedly they were all a foot or less in  diameter  and
not a great impediment as blowdowns go, but they all  required  at  least  a
high step to get over, and after counting well over a hundred of them  in  a
distance of about half a mile, they  began  to  take  their  toll  and  slow
progress.

Things improved when I entered older more mature forest after about  a  mile
and started the traverse along East Cr. The blowdowns were  now  larger  but
thankfully  much  less  frequent.  Then  once  past  the  Boulder  Cr  Trail
junction, elev 4700 ft (4 miles, 2300 ft, 2:45  hr),  the  trail  completely
deteriorated. I don\'t think this section has been maintained  in  years,  if
not decades. I stayed with it as it dropped about 300  ft,  then  completely
lost it in heavy brush and multiple blowdowns. It took me  another  hour  of
brush crashing to stumble upon it  again.  It  actually  crosses  the  creek
twice and not exactly where  the  map  indicates.  After  the  second  creek
crossing, there was less brush but more large blowdowns to contend  with.  I
found little evidence of travel by other people and no signs  of  previously
used campsites. Any normal backpacker would have given up well  before  now.
I had to make my own spot to camp in the woods at 5:45 just  past  the  (now
dry) creek that drains the basin W of Azurite1, elev 4960 ft (6 miles,  2900
ft, 5:00 hrs).

Day 2: The days are getting noticeable shorter. It was dark when I  went  to
bed at 8:00 and still dark when I got up at  6:00,  but  I  slept  long  and
well. I left camp a little after 7:00, crossed the  creek  and  headed  west
upslope toward Azurite4. Travel was fairly easy, in fact it was easier  than
the "trail" had been, and in an hour I reached lovely Lake 5925.  More  easy
travel up heather and scree that snaked through minor cliffs and  along  the
ridge put me on the summit of Azurite4 (Pk 7157)  at  9:45  where  I  had  a
gorgeous view of Majestic Mtn, McKay Ridge, Ragged  Ridge  and  anything  to
the north and west. The sun was still too low in  the  sky  to  clearly  see
peaks to the east and south. There was a cairn on top but no register.

I now began my proposed horseshoe traverse, following the  ridge  south  and
east toward Methow Pinnacles. This ridge is an absolute delight,  easily  up
there with "my best ridges ever".  It may not be quite as good  as  my  last
ridge trip (Stetattle Ridge), but it was  darn  close.  I  wandered  up  and
down, went over Pt 7073, dropped to a level section with a grove  of  alpine
larches just beginning to show gold (give them another couple of  weeks  and
they will be at their prime),  passed  a  short  narrow  rocky  section  and
dropped again to the broad low point saddle (elev 6400 ft) before  beginning
the final climb to the Pinnacles. Here red fall color made a sharp  contrast
to the gray dead trees of a recent burn. After some unpleasant  loose  scree
I reached the high point of the Methow Pinnacles (the North Peak) at  12:50.
There was neither a cairn nor a  register.  I  added  both  to  the  highest
boulder. I looked S toward the appealing rocky Middle Peak concluding I  did
not have the time to add it to my itinerary. It would  take  some  technical
climbing to get up.

My problem now was how to get down to Mebee Pass and continue  to  Azurite1.
All of the E face of the Pinnacles is a 1000 ft rock wall and most of the  N
face is quite cliffy as well. If I couldn\'t find a direct  descent  I  would
have to make a long detour. Beckey mentions a party that had climbed  the  E
face and then descended a "ravine" to Mebee Pass  from  the  N  end  of  the
ridge. What he meant by a "ravine", I had no clue. I would just have  to  go
take a look and see if it was something I could easily descend. I  traversed
N on more unpleasant loose scree, on the west slope, to the very end of  the
ridge at about 7200 ft, where I did indeed find a way  down.  The  beginning
was a steep loose gully but lower down  it  broadened  nicely  (Is  a  broad
gully a ravine?) and easily brought me to  Mebee  Pass,  elev  6480  ft,  at
2:40.

I crossed the trail at the Pass, staying on the crest of the ridge. I  could
see it looked doable as far as Pt 7482. Beyond that I couldn\'t really  tell,
but the map indicated possible problems. The ridge to Azurite1  was  not  as
delightful as the one from Azurite4, but it was still pleasant enough and  I
had an added unexpected bonus of stumbling upon an abandoned lookout with  a
great view on the first promontory above the pass.  Where on earth did  this
come from? I have never heard of this lookout, had no idea it was  here  and
I ran across no trail going to it. Then I came to the notch  below  Pt  7482
and my heart sank.  The  ridge  connecting  to  Azurite1  was  a  series  of
gendarmes and impassible. To make matters worse, it wasn\'t going to be  easy
to get off the ridge from where I was now to  descend  to  the  basin  below
Azurite1 and the peak itself didn\'t look trivial either.  It  certainly  was
not a walkup.

I did manage to find a way off the ridge down a gosh awful  extremely  steep
loose gully.  It is times like these that I am glad I  am  alone  because  I
doubt many people would follow me down such a gully and if they were  stupid
enough to actually do so we might very likely  end  up  killing  each  other
with falling rock. Alone I didn\'t have to worry about talking  someone  into
doing something dangerous or kicking rocks down on anyone else.  And  I  did
send quite a few downhill. Once below the gendarmes, I traversed to a  gully
(It wasn\'t as bad as it had looked from a distance)  that  threaded  between
cliffs to the summit  of  Azirite1  at  4:45.  There  was  a  cairn  but  no
register, which surprised me a little as I am  pretty  sure  Stefan  climbed
this peak from Azurite Pass.  The sun was in the right position  now  for  a
magnificent close-up view of Azurite.

I now had to get back to camp, hopefully before dark. I reversed  the  final
gully, then headed straight downhill  keeping  to  the  left  of  the  basin
drainage creek. I ran into a little brush, but for the most part it  was  an
easy descent and I came right out at camp at 6:30 (8 miles, 5500  ft,  11:20
hrs) with enough daylight left to wash  up  in  the  creek  and  eat  dinner
before turning in again at 8:00.

Day 3: I did a better job of staying on the trail on the  way  out  and  saw
where I lost it on the way in. Even so, it was still slow tedious going  and
I didn\'t improve much on my in time. I left at 8:00 and hit the TH at  12:15
(6 miles, 600 ft, 4:15 hrs). I saw no one on the trail or anywhere else  for
that matter the whole 3 days I was out.

Grand Total: 20 miles and 9000 ft in 3 days

I seem to forget something on every trip. Usually it is a  minor  thing  and
of little consequence, but this time I forgot a  doozey.  I  forgot  all  my
food, a first for me. Well, not entirely all of it.  I  did  have  my  fresh
fruit, hardboiled egg and cheese (These  things  I  put  in  the  morning  I
leave. The rest I usually put in the night before.) But  everything  else  I
forgot. Shows my state of mind lately. Fortunately, I  remembered  I  forgot
(it that an oxymoron?) while still in Marblemount, getting my permit,  where
there is a small Food Mart. Pickings were pretty slim here for someone  with
my dietary restrictions, but I did manage to add enough food to  survive.  I
was so happy they had Cliff Bars. Not that I am that fond of  them,  but  at
least they are fairly healthy. Actually, I don\'t really eat that much  while
exercising strenuously. What I really missed was my powdered  Cytomax  sport
drink, which gets me through the day, and all my supplements.  I  discovered
I can exist without them, but they really do make a difference.

Day 1: Delayed by my side trip to the  Food  Mart  and  by  stopping  for  a
hamburger to at least start with a full tummy, it was 1:35  by  the  time  I
started from the Bridge Cr TH, elev 4600 ft, on the North  Cascades  Hwy.  I
followed the Stiletto Spur Trail 3.3 miles downhill and then the Twisp  Pass
Trail 3.3 miles uphill to a camp on Dagger Lake  (6.6  miles,  1900  ft  and
3:15 hrs). I set up camp and was just starting for  Lincoln  Butte,  when  a
lone woman showed up obviously intending to spend the  night  at  the  lake.
Since there is only one party permit (but that can include up to 12  people)
issued for Dagger Lake, and I  had  it,  I  knew  she  didn\'t  have  one.  I
explained to her that she was in the North Cascades  National  Park,  should
have a permit and, if she ran into a ranger, would most certainly  be  asked
to produce one. She was from California visiting a friend and  had  no  idea
about the rules and regulations of this area. Since  she  was  a  very  nice
young woman (her name was Sara) and I feel a  special  kindred  spirit  with
all solo females, I welcomed her company. I might have felt differently  had
she been a rowdy group of teenagers.

It was now about 5:45 and I was pushing it to get up Lincoln Butte and  back
before dark. I reached Twisp Pass at 6:11 and, going  as  fast  as  I  could
possibly go, the summit at 7:00. It was farther and harder than I  expected,
with a class 3 rocky section that required a little care and, as  always,  a
false summit, with the true summit on along a  narrow  ridge  that  required
more care. I ran into a little fresh snow from the last storm along the  way
but it caused no problem. I came down the last bit to camp by headlamp  (3.5
miles, 1800 ft, 2:40 hrs RT), ate my meager cold dinner, but with warm  tea,
and turned in at 9:30. It was a cold night and I was glad I had switched  to
my warmer sleeping bag for this trip.

Day 2: I was up at 6:00. Sara had hung her food with mine at the  bear  wire
by my site and came to get it as I was starting for Hock Mtn  at  7:30.  She
complained of having spent a cold night. From  camp  I  crossed  the  outlet
creek of Dagger Lake and angled SW to the large  talus  basin  below  the  N
face of Hock, and onto the NW ridge, which I followed  to  the  summit.   It
was easy enough going, easier than Lincoln Butte, but a  freezing  wind  was
blowing and I was mighty cold. I had on  all  my  clothes,  except  my  down
jacket and I even considered wearing that.  My  hands  were  especially  bad
off. I needed warmer gloves. Whatever happened to summer?  The forecast  had
been good for today when I left town, but I could  see  weather  approaching
the whole time I was climbing the ridge. By the time I  reached  the  summit
(2400 ft, 2:20 hrs) views were limited and it  began  to  snow  lightly.  My
plan to follow the ridge to Twisp was unwise under  such  conditions  if  it
was even doable.

I retreated to the N talus basin and  traversed  below  the  ridge  until  I
could climb easy heather slopes to the summit  of  Twisp  Mtn  (3700  ft,  5
hrs). I was now in complete fog and could see  nothing.  Again,  I  felt  it
unwise to follow the ridge to Twisp Pass, and  was  forced  by  terrain  and
conditions to descend the NW ridge back to Dagger  Lake.  Precipitation  was
light, but now more rain than snow, all the brush was wet and my  feet  were
soaked. I stopped by my tent to change socks and ran into Sara  again.   She
had hiked to Twisp Pass and was getting ready to have a warm  drink.  I  was
actually surprised she was still around and hadn\'t hightailed  it  out.  But
although  this  was  her  first  solo  overnight,  she  was  actually  quite
experienced and had led trips before.  She just wasn\'t  used  to  the  North
Cascades.

After changing socks, I started for  Switchblade  Pk,  picking  up  the  old
trail from Twisp Pass toward Stiletto and then finding a way trail  to  Lake
6795. This is a lovely high mountain lake, quite large and  deep.  I  had  a
little trouble finding a way up Switchblade from the lake, as  I  could  see
nothing. Trusting the map, I headed for the SW face where the contours  seem
the  most  friendly.  It  wasn\'t  difficult   climbing,   just   challenging
routefinding in the fog and mist as I wove my way up  from  gully  to  gully
onto the S ridge and the summit (6300 ft, 9:30 hrs). I especially had to  be
careful coming down to retrace my route exactly  and  not  get  hung  up  on
cliffs.  I headed straight back to camp having had enough for  this  day  (8
miles, 6300 ft, 11:30 hrs). The last  two  peaks  would  have  to  wait  for
tomorrow, or another trip if the weather  did  not  improve.  My  feet  were
soaked again and I was down to my last pair of dry  socks.  Sara  was  still
around and we commiserated over the fickleness of  North  Cascades  weather.
We hoped with the cloud cover tonight would at least be warmer.

Day 3: It was not warmer.  It was colder. My  boots  even  froze  inside  my
tent. But that meant there was clearing and it promised to  be  a  beautiful
day. I was happy that Sara would have at least one nice day.  She  did  plan
on going out today. I packed up all my gear and  headed  once  again  toward
Twisp Pass at 8:00, planning on picking up my last  two  peaks  while  going
out the Stiletto Pk trail - if I could find it. The GT map shows this  trail
ending well below Stiletto Pk, but an old trail went all the  way  to  Twisp
Pass at one time. This trail is quite good for about a mile from  the  pass,
then is lost in a large meadow below Lake 6795. No matter. I knew  where  it
was  supposed  to  go,  so  just  headed  in  the  right  direction  through
absolutely gorgeous meadows.  I had no idea this area was  so  beautiful.  I
highly recommend a visit, peaks or no peaks.

I dropped my big pack (1600 ft,  2  hrs)  in  a  strategic  spot  below  and
between Stiletto Pk and Jacknife Pk, continuing with a light daypack. I  was
now in blessed sunshine with all the views I  had  missed  the  day  before.
Both peaks were very pleasant class 3+ scrambles on fun (and now dry)  rock.
Stiletto had an old heavy brass Mountaineer register  on  top,  but  it  was
only filled with scraps of paper. I recognized  the  names  of  Don  Goodman
(8/20/00) and Fred Beavon (8/31/04). Jacknife had a glass  jar  register  in
which I recognized Don Beavon (7/3/98) and Martin Shetter (7/5/03).  A  John
Burroughs climbed the peak on 7/11/81 claiming a first ascent and naming  it
"Dirk Pk". The name certainly didn\'t stick.

I was back at my pack at 12:15 (2700, 4:15 hrs.)  and  continued  traversing
around Stiletto Pk though more lovely meadows making my way to a final  6240
ft saddle below the old 7223 ft LO site. I had hoped to pick  up  the  trail
here but I had trouble finding it. I had to descend straight down  from  the
saddle before finally running into the trail at  5500  ft.   This  ended  up
being a very good trail. Someday I must follow it all the way uphill to  its
end. I certainly wouldn\'t mind revisiting all those gorgeous meadows. I  hit
the main trail at 2:15 and followed it annoyingly uphill  the  rest  of  the
way back to the car (9.4 miles, 3400 ft, 7 hrs). When I  got  home  my  food
bag was just where I had left it on the kitchen counter. Well, I guess I  am
already packed for my next trip.

Grand Total: 27.5 miles and 13,200 ft in 3 days.

American Ridge


American Ridge is a scenic ridge about  15  miles  long  that  lies  between
American River and Bumping River E of Mt Rainier.  Along  the  up  and  down
crest are 7 peaks of prominence. The only one  that  is  named  is  Goat  Pk
(6473 ft) and that was the only one I had previously climbed.  The  other  6
are referred to in Jeff\'s Master List as American  Ridge  1  to  6,  running
from W to E. 5 of these 6 are easily accessed from the  trail  that  follows
most of the ridge. But the highest point, American Ridge 3 (6960+ ft), is  a
craggy summit that the trail avoids by traversing far beneath it. It is  the
only one that offers more than a hike.  However the others are  worth  doing
just for the pleasure of following the ridge. The entire ridge is  too  long
to do in one day, so I broke it up into two daytrips.

American Ridge 4 (6240+ ft - 400P), American Ridge 5 (6320+ ft -  480P)  and
American Ridge 6 (6197 ft - 477P) - Goose Prairie Quad - September 27, 2007

For this section of the ridge I created a loop trip by going up the Goat  Cr
Trail, hiking the crest that included these three summits, coming  down  the
Goose Prairie Trail and connecting the two trailheads with a 3.6  mile  bike
ride along the Bumping Lake Road. The day was warm and  pleasant  with  good
views and I in fact hiked the whole day in shorts. I reached American  Ridge
6 in 2:45 hrs, American Ridge 5 in 4 hrs, American  Ridge  4  in  4:45,  and
(after a small shortcut to bypass a meandering trail) my bike at the far  TH
on the paved road at 7:25 hrs. A 20-minute pedal put me back at my car.

Total: 16 miles, 4400 ft and 7:45 hrs.

Old Scab Mtn (6608 ft - 968P) & Pk 6435 (515P) - Old Scab Mtn Quad;  and  Pk
4440+ (400P) & Haystack Rock (3932 ft - 452P) -  Cliffdell  Quad  -  Oct  3,
2007

Before I could get back to the rest of American Ridge  the  weather  made  a
turn for the worse with snow levels dropping and a very unsettled  forecast.
I really didn\'t want to be on the ridge under such conditions, so I  decided
to instead go for Old Scab Mtn on the  other  side  of  the  Bumping  River.
Getting to the high TH at 5900 ft would entail  wandering  miles  of  forest
roads, which seemed like a good plan for a  bad  weather  day.   There  were
several other summits of prominence nearby, all approached by more miles  of
roads.

I knew I would be getting into significant snow, so it would have been  nice
to have been in my Jeep.  However, it had been creamed by  a  falling  maple
branch in my driveway a few days before that put  two  large  dents  in  the
roof and took out a rear side window and was in  the  shop  being  repaired.
That left me with my Subaru, which I did manage to coax all the way  to  the
TH, although I did a bit of slipping and sliding in 4-5 inches  of  snow  at
the top and almost got myself stuck turning around on the narrow  road.  Old
Scab Mtn itself turned out to be an interesting if short climb up the  steep
SE ridge, made somewhat treacherous by the  fresh  snow  coating  the  final
summit rocks. Total: 3.5 miles, 1725 ft and 3.45 hrs.
To fill out the day, I also climbed 3 other peaks. Pk  6435,  Pk  4440+  and
Haystack Rock were each no more than 30 minutes RT  on  foot.   The  hardest
part of the latter two was finding the correct roads to  get  close  enough.
Haystack Rock was the most interesting with its rocky little crags.

American Ridge 2 (6265 ft - 465P - Cougar Lk  Quad)  and  American  Ridge  3
(6960+ ft - 1880P - Bumping Lk Quad) - October 5, 2007

I waited for another good weather day before returning  to  American  Ridge.
This time I approached from the Mesatchee Cr Trail and  reached  the  summit
of American Ridge 2 in 2:45 hrs. I descended back to the trail and  followed
it another couple miles to the Big Basin S of American Ridge 3.  This  is  a
gorgeous open basin that was now covered with significant snow, 8 inches  or
more where drifted, and I  was  slowed  down  by  trailbreaking.  There  was
enough of the white stuff that I lost the trail and was  wishing  I  had  my
skis. I traversed out of the basin onto the S slope of  the  peak,  crossing
multiple gullies and  slabby  rocky  ribs  until  I  could  make  the  final
scramble to top. It was farther and harder to get to than I had thought  and
took 5:30 hrs total. From the summit, I could see that the N  slope  was  an
easier route back, although it entailed traversing steep snow that was  knee
deep in places. Once past Pt 6946, I crossed the ridge and took  a  shortcut
straight downhill to intersect the trail  saving  myself  several  miles  of
backtracking.

Total: 13.5 miles, 5200 ft and 8 hrs.

Oh yes, I still have American Ridge 1 left to do.

Nelson Ridge (7292 ft - 852P - Bumping Lk Quad) and Timberwolf  Mtn  3,  aka
"Buffalo Hump" (6960+ ft - 720P -Timberwolf Mtn Quad) - October 8, 2007

Other than Mt Aix and Bismarck Pk, I really haven\'t done much  exploring  in
that portion of the  William  O.  Douglas  Wilderness  E  of  Bumping  Lake.
Judging by the quality of these two peaks and others I  got  a  view  of,  I
should really do more.

I had a little trouble finding the TH for the  Richmond  Mine  (Thunder  Cr)
Trail. It is at the  end  of  an  obscure  unmarked  road  that  turns  left
immediately after the paved road crosses the Bumping  River.  Several  rough
tracks wander around the area but the TH (elev 3400  ft)  is  marked  and  a
Forest Pass required. As I was getting ready to go, a hunter  on  foot  came
out the trail and two more showed up in  a  pickup  truck,  all  dressed  in
camouflage. Turns out it is muzzle loading season. Who outside  the  hunting
community can keep track of all the  various  seasons  -  early  hunt,  high
hunt, late hunt, archery, muzzle loading, modern firearm,  bear,  deer,  elk
etc., etc.? The best bet is once late summer and fall arrives,  just  assume
there is some hunt going on.

 I had a nice conversation with the fellow on foot. When I talk to  hunters,
they seem like pleasant and reasonable people,  for  the  most  part,  doing
what they enjoy. It is just that our interests are so  very  different,  and
somehow they make me uncomfortable and  feeling  vulnerable  carrying  their
powerful weapons when I am completely unarmed. Ironically (since he  was  in
camouflage), the hunter asked if I was  wearing  anything  brightly  colored
and warned me to be careful. Warned ME  to  be  careful?  How  about  HE  be
careful and look well before taking a shot! In the end, though, once on  the
trail it really didn\'t matter. Hunters are by nature mostly lazy and do  not
stray too far from  their  vehicles  as  they  know  if  they  actually  bag
anything they then have to pack  it  out.  Unless  of  course  they  are  on
horseback - but that is another story. I soon left the  hunters  far  behind
and saw no one the rest of the day.

It was a good trail and in 2 hours I reached  the  6200  ft  saddle  in  the
ridge above Richmond Lake. I continued SW along  the  ridge  until  I  could
traverse S across a snowy basin to the main ridge N of Nelson Ridge.  Travel
was slowed as I broke trail across snow covered talus  often  finding  holes
and sinking in to my knees or deeper. Nelson Ridge,  both  on  the  map  and
from this viewpoint, appeared quite craggy and I worried it  would  give  me
some difficulty but that  was  not  the  case.  All  pinnacles  were  easily
bypassed on the  W  slope.  The  climb  was  little  more  than  a  hike  in
difficulty, but it was varied and interesting. I  soon  reached  the  summit
(4200 ft, 4 hrs) and spent a pleasant half hour on top eating  my  lunch  in
the sun.

I had a good view of  Timberwolf  3.  This  peak  is  listed  in  Beckey  as
"Buffalo Hump" and he describes it as "hardly more than  a  scramble",  what
ever that means. Well, what I saw didn\'t look that easy. The  summit  was  a
cliffy fin-like crag that sure looked like it could be a problem. But  maybe
there was an easier way up than what I could see  from  my  viewpoint.  Only
one way to find out. I  retraced  my  steps  to  Richmond  saddle  and  then
followed the ridge NE past an impressive spire to the  base  of  the  summit
rocks. Sure enough, it all looked like impassible cliff. I hadn\'t  bargained
on this and had no climbing gear with me other than my  60  ft  panic  rope.
Didn\'t even bring any slings. My only  hope,  I  thought,  was  to  traverse
around the cliffs on the W (the E was a sheer cliff) to the N side  and  see
if things looked better there. In doing that, I discovered a small break  in
the wall on the SW corner. Leaving my pack, and taking only my  rope  and  a
register, I climbed the break to discover a  series  of  narrow,  but  quite
passable, ledges circling back around to the E above  the  wall  and  easier
ground. In total it was about 100 ft of exposed class 4 rock,  really  quite
a lot of fun. I passed an old tattered  rappel  sling  at  the  end  of  the
tricky stuff before the final short scramble  to  the  top  (5200  ft,  6:20
hrs). I found an old rusted threaded pipe  on  top,  but  it  was  empty.  I
placed my register inside it.

I downclimbed back to my pack, went W straight downhill and intersected  the
trail at 5600 ft. I startled a lone mountain goat  shortly  below  the  crag
and he took off running. Then once on the trail, I was  startled  to  see  a
large owl glide directly for me.  At  the  last  minute,  perhaps  correctly
deciding I was a tad large for dinner,  he  swerved  up  and  perched  on  a
branch not two feet from my head. I reached the car at  dusk.  The  hunters\'
truck was still there but they were nowhere to be seen.

Total: 12 miles, 5200 ft and 8: 15 hrs.

The DOT usually closes Chinook Pass at the first big snowstorm, but October is a bit early even for them, so when 1.5-2 feet of snow fell  on Saturday (October 20) I had my first chance in many a year to ski there.   I had saved these two peaks for possible ski ascents and now seemed my opportunity to try for them. The first peak made for a reasonable ski ascent. The second was more questionable.

A not too early start on a Sunday worked to my advantage by allowing someone else to already break trail to the Naches-Tahtlum Ridge. From then on I was on my own, but it wasn\'t too bad and the skiing was really quite good to the summit of Tahtlum Pk (3 miles, 1400 ft, 2:30 hrs). Now the hard part started. I knew from the map that getting to Norse3 would be difficult on skis. It was not possible to follow the ridge, but I did see a reasonable way down, at least to start, from a 6400 ft saddle slightly N of the summit. I even got in a few good turns. Then it turned steep, with hidden cliff bands and inadequately snow cover on brush and logs and I was forced to remove skis several times to get past obstacles and to descend to 5300 ft. This was followed by a steep climb to the 5600 ft saddle S of Norse3, again on foot. I got in a little more skiing on the gentle ridge before it became too narrow and rocky. I reached the summit at 3:40 (5 miles, 2400 ft, 5:30 hrs) much later than I had hoped.

I now knew I would be coming out in the dark. I tried to correct some of my route finding errors of the way in by dropping even lower, to 5000 ft, but I don\'t think I gained much. I was able to keep skis on for the entire 1400 ft climb back to the 6400 ft saddle, but the trailbreaking was so exhausting in the deep snow that I didn\'t reach it till 7:00. In addition, I was using my winter ski pack for the first time this year and had neglected to check the headlamp that always resides there. When I went to turn it on, I discovered the batteries were dead. At this point I began to get a little worried. Then I remembered that I always carry a backup light in this pack. It was not as powerful as my main headlamp (with good batteries, that is) but it was good enough to get me out as all I had to do was follow my ski tracks. Actually, from the 6400 ft saddle on, the skiing was enjoyable. I really don\'t mind skiing by headlamp and find I can often see better by it than in the flat light of a foggy day. Nevertheless, I was most happy when I reached the car at 9:00.

Total: 10 miles, 4300 ft and 10:50 hrs

Birthday Climbs


By a strange coincidence both Ian and my son Walter have the same  birthday,
November 19. Of course the birth year is a bit different, by some 25  years.
I was able to celebrate both birthdays, the day before with  Ian  and  gang,
the day of with Walter.

Sexagenarian Pk (aka Higgins W Pk - 4880+ ft - 440P -  Mt  Higgins  Quad)  -
November 18, 2007

In keeping with celebrating Ian\'s 60th birthday, John  Roper  came  up  with
this previously unnamed peak as an appropriate goal and the  nearby  Higgins
Lookout site as an alternate for those less inclined  to  peakbagging.  With
dual attractive destinations, shared organization  by  John  and  Mitch  and
much better than expected weather, 19 humans and 3 dogs showed  up  for  the
festivities.  I  am  sure  the  2  fellows  unattached  to  our  group   who
encountered this mass of celebrants on the lookout site  didn\'t  quite  know
what to make of it all. After popping the champagne cork and  congratulating
Ian, the majority of people started back down  the  trail,  while  4  of  us
(Dick Kegel, Jim Nelson, Ian and I) set out  for  Sexagenarian.  I  am  sure
more would have joined, but the peak  looked  rather  frightful  and  cliffy
from the lookout, and though there was not that much snow what little  there
was, was very icy. We traversed past cliffs to the W  side  and  worked  our
way  up  steep  brushy  and  forested  dirt  made  treacherous  by  the  icy
conditions. Crampons would have been helpful. It all took maybe  45  minutes
from the lookout. Coming down was even longer as we used  my  60  ft  "panic
rope" in a series of short arm rappels to avoid  slipping  on  the  ice.  We
were all happy to have this assist in the slicker spots, with  the  possible
excerption of Dick. He soon found it too much of a bother and just took  off
downhill. I was very impressed. With better conditions none  of  this  would
have been a problem at all. I had never climbed  with  either  Dick  or  Jim
before, and Ian is always a pleasure, so this little diversion was a  lovely
finale to a fun day.

9.5 miles, 4100 ft and 7:45 hrs

Fools Day Pk (5203 ft - 403P - Kachess Lk Quad) - November 19, 2007

I was out again the next day on my son\'s birthday. It  was  a  challenge  to
find something neither of us had done, close enough  and  accessible  enough
that it could be fit into a short
day as he had to be home in time to finish celebrating with his new wife.  I
came up with this little peak near Thorp Mtn. I had thought  to  go  up  the
old road on the N side but we couldn\'t drive that far due to a  snowy  road.
We ran into much more new snow in this area than I  had  encountered  on  Mt
Higgins and after slipping and sliding in some 5-6 inches of  the  stuff,  I
opted for Plan B, a XC route up  the  E  ridge.  This  was  really  quite  a
pleasant route with little brush and in 2 hours we were on top. In  fact  it
was so pleasant that I am keeping it in mind as a future ski  trip.  With  a
foot more snow it would be very skiable indeed although then one would  have
to start from the Cle Elum River.

Raven Roost Quad - November 21, 2007

There was snow right away as I turned off Hwy 410  onto  the  Little  Naches
River Road. When I read the sign saying "Raven Roost 14  miles"  as  I  next
turned onto road 1902 it seemed hopeless that I could get  close  enough  to
climb it. But miraculously I was able,  with  difficulty  and  only  because
there was a good track made by others (and I was in my Jeep),  to  drive  to
5000 ft and within 3 miles. That made for a very easy ski  up  the  road  to
the tower studded summit. Just as I reached  the  top  I  was  joined  by  3
snowmobiles. I soon left them, and they could not  follow,  as  I  descended
off the summit into the Norse Peak  Wilderness  to  the  saddle  with  Raven
Roost 1. The snow was absolutely gorgeous dry powder,  the  kind  where  you
can do no wrong, the only caveat being there wasn\'t quite enough of  it.  In
the vegetated meadows it was fine but I had to watch in it rocky  areas.   I
did put a few more scratches on my ski bases. From the saddle  I  worked  my
way up the delightful ridge to the summit of Raven  Roost  1.  Although  the
temperature was in the low 20s, the sun was warm  and  I  spent  a  pleasant
half hour on top. I could not get over the beauty of the  snow  on  the  ski
out.  This must be the norm for Eastern Washington. Quite a contrast to  our
usual Western Washington slush. Wish I could ski in this area more often.

Total: 8.5 miles, 2000 ft and 4:30 hrs.



Raven Roost Quad 2 (4907 ft - 587P) - Raven Roost Quad - November 28, 2007

I had planned to ski east of Cayuse Pass on this day, but when I woke up  in
the morning both Chinook and Cayuse had been closed overnight. Darn!  On  to
Plan B. While checking out peaks on the Raven  Roost  Quad,  I  had  noticed
that Raven Roost 2 could be approached from  the  Pyramid  Cr  SnoPark  near
Greenwater on the west. It would be a long trip and would involve a  descent
into the Naches drainage but it could be done.

The bad news was the Pyramid Cr SnoPark was already in  place  and  I  could
drive no higher (2700 ft). The good news was the road  to  the  SnoPark  was
plowed. I swear they plow this road better than Hwy 410. For variety,  after
skiing about a mile, I turned off onto a spur  road  that  led  to  the  Old
Naches Wagon Trail. Probably not a good idea as  this  historic  route  over
Naches Pass is quite narrow, wanders up and down  along  the  ridge  and  is
very steep in spots. At one point it was so steep I took  off  my  skis  and
walked up but that was because I didn\'t want to put on skins.  Eventually  I
connected with the main road again and hit the high point of 4900 ft at  the
Pyramid Peak Saddle (5.7 miles, 2700 ft, 3 hrs). A descent of 2.7 miles  and
600 ft followed until I was below the summit of Raven Roost 2. Here  I  left
skis, as there was not enough snow to cover brush and logs,  and  booted  to
the top (8.7 miles, 3400 ft, 4:30 hrs). It started  to  snow  as  I  slogged
back to the saddle, but once there it was a pleasant ski  down  to  the  car
sticking to the main road the whole way this time. I was passed  by  several
groups of snowmobiles. I could tell they were not  used  to  encountering  a
skier in this area. When I reached the SnoPark the plow  was  hard  at  work
once again.



Total: 18.2 miles, 4100 ft and 7:45 hrs.

Skate Mtn Peaks

I have to remind myself each winter to scale  back  my  ambitions.   I  keep
thinking I can knock off several peaks  per  trip.  Then  reality  sets  in.
Either I can\'t drive as far as I had planned,  trailbreaking  is  more  work
than anticipated, the weather is worse than hoped  for,  the  peak  is  more
difficult than I thought or I just plain run out of time.  For  these  peaks
it was all of the above. It took me 3 separate trips to  get  all  of  them.
There are at least 3 more peaks in the vicinity  that  would  probably  take
another 3 separate trips, were I ever to go back for them.

Skate Mtn, East Pk (4800+ ft - 760P - Tatoosh  Lakes  Quad)  -  December  6,
2007

My original plan this day was to climb the 3 peaks of Dixon Mtn. Stefan  had
done just that the previous weekend so I had good  beta  on  conditions  and
route. Problem was the big storm hit in the interim and the  gate  on  Skate
Cr Road was closed due to a washout. So I instead set my  sights  on  nearby
Skate Mtn, which road had no gate, naively thinking I could do  both  peaks.
I was lucky to get one.

I drove Road 47 and Road 4720 to the snowline at 2600 ft. I  could  probably
have gotten farther had I been in my Jeep. Instead I was in my  Subaru,  not
planning on having to drive snowy back roads. So  I  had  some  intermittent
bare road patches the first half mile until I reached consistent  snow.  The
base snow had been rained on a lot but there was a couple  inches  fresh  on
top that made for good road skiing.   Shortly  before  the  main  Skate  Mtn
ridge, elev 4000 ft, I picked up an old ditched road that made  its  way  on
the N side of the ridge to  end  in  a  clearcut.  From  there  I  traversed
crosscountry to the final saddle W of what I thought was the summit.

At the saddle the snow was too thin to cover the downed trees and debris  in
the initial woods and so I mistakenly left my skis  behind  and  booted  the
rest of the way to the first summit. This was okay in  the  woods  but  near
the top it opened up and there I postholed  in  kneedeep  slush.  Then  upon
reaching the first summit I could see another point to the  SE  that  looked
higher to me (it had the same map contour of 4800 ft) along the fairly  open
crest. I knew it would take a long time to posthole  there  even  though  it
was only about .3 mile away. But by now I had given up also  getting  the  W
peak. Even If I had had the time, the ridge to it  looked  long  and  cliffy
and probably was not a good way to go. The W Pk would best be  climbed  from
the W on another trip.  So I trudged on to the second  summit  which  turned
out to be a small rocky knob that did read higher on my  altimeter.  But  it
was slow going through awful deep slush. By the time I got back to  my  skis
it was almost 4:00 (RT had taken 2 hrs). I made it to the main  road  before
dark, and then had an enjoyable run by headlight to  the  car.   Total:  9.5
miles, 2850 ft and 6:30 hrs.

Skate Mtn, West Pk (5240+ ft - 1480P - Wahpenayo Pk  Quad)  -  December  17,
2007

I had to wait a week and a half for skiing conditions to  improve  with  new
snow and when it did there was almost too much of it.  I drove  Road  47  to
where a sign stated it was closed to all motor vehicles except  snowmobiles,
elev 2400 ft, at which point there was a consistent snowpack of  6-8  inches
(this time I was in my Jeep). The snow depth increased rapidly to the  point
of a foot or more of fresh by the time I skied the 4  miles  to  Road  4745,
elev 3200 ft. To my dismay there was no evidence  of  any  snowmobiles  ever
having been up the road so I had to break trail all  by  myself.  Where  are
those pesky machines when you need them? When they would be of use they  are
nowhere to be seen and when you want  them  to  go  away  they  are  buzzing
around everywhere.

My speed continued to decrease as the  snow  depth  increased  and  it  took
another 2 hours to travel the additional 2 miles to the main W  ridge,  elev
4200 ft. I could feel the time slipping away. Again I  had  hoped  to  climb
more peaks in the area and again I was lucky to  get  one.  To  add  to  the
problems, when I got my first good look at the W Pk  it  was  much  cliffier
than I had expected and I wasn\'t even sure I could find a  reasonable  route
up the final rocks in the allotted time.

I put on skins, left the road and headed straight up the last thousand  feet
toward the summit through old clearcut. There  was  some  brush  to  contend
with, but for the most part the going was open with enough  snow  cover  for
skis. But the trailbreaking was exhausting and took another 2.5 hours.  When
I reached the base of the cliffs, I traversed right beneath them  to  the  S
ridge, elev about 5100 ft, where I luckily found a way  through  the  rocks.
Here I left my skis and kicked steps up a steep  gully.  Fortunately  I  had
brought an ice  axe  along,  as  the  first  part  was  a  bit  tricky  with
unconsolidated powder snow. Even though it was knee to thigh  deep,  I  sank
all the way in to the slippery frozen turf and rock  underneath.  I  emerged
onto the summit at 6:00. Needless to say it was now dark.

I had a great  ski,  with  some  very  nice  turns,  back  to  the  road  by
headlight. I was down in 30 minutes what had taken 2.5 hours to get up.  The
road itself wasn\'t as fast. With only one person breaking trail,  my   track
wasn\'t that great and much of the road was gentle to  downright  flat  (even
slightly uphill in a few spots) so I got very little free glide and  had  to
stride most of the way out. By the time I reached the car at 9:00,  I  swore
I would never ski this road again. How quickly I forget. Total: 13.5  miles,
3100 ft and 10:15 hrs.

Wahpenayo3 (4560+ ft - 400P - Wahpenayo Pk Quad) - December 21, 2007

I was back 4 days later, miffed that I was previously so close to this  peak
and yet  unable to get it. I again drove to the sign on Road 47,  this  time
barely making it that far in my Jeep. Again no snowmobiles had been  on  the
road so with the new dump of fresh snow, I had to break trail up  this  road
all over again and it was just as much work and  just  as  slow  as  before.
Again I hoped to get other peaks. Again I was lucky to get just one. Will  I
ever learn?

I skinned up and left Road 4745 near the upper switchback (5 Â¼  miles,  1650
ft, 4 hrs) heading straight for Wahpenayo3.  I  thought  I  would  be  there
easily in an hour, but it was harder than I thought  to  actually  find  the
peak in the featureless forest terrain and I did a bit of wandering  around,
all while breaking heavy trail. I finally stumbled onto the summit almost  2
hours later just at sunset (6.5 miles, 2400 ft, 5:50 hrs).  I  actually  had
fun skiing out my track to the road and there was a gorgeous  full  moon  to
add to the delight, but the road itself  was  as  annoyingly  flat  as  last
time.  Let\'s see if this time I can stick to  my  resolution  never  to  ski
this road again, despite several more peaks in the area.  Total:  13  miles,
2450 ft and 9 hrs.

Taneum Point (3920+ ft) and Osborn Point (3880+ ft) - Frost Mtn Quad -
January 9, 2008

Worn out by exhausting trailbreaking and frustrated by  not  being  able  to
get anywhere in knee deep snow from the frequent  storms  of  the  past  few
weeks, I gave up on  the  backcountry  and  headed  for  groomed  snowmobile
country. I wasn\'t expecting much other than being  able  to  get  in  a  few
miles without breaking trail, but I ended up having a surprisingly  pleasant
tour.

I started from the Taneum Sno-Park (elev 2400 ft), 6 miles up Taneum  Cr  on
Road 33 from I-90 near Thorp. At first I thought I wasn\'t  going  to  escape
breaking trail even here as I was the first one to navigate the  6-8  inches
of fresh snow on the road in my Subaru on this Wednesday morning.  But  upon
reaching the Sno-Park, I discovered the snowmobile road  had  been  recently
groomed and only had a dusting of fresh snow.  As I have discovered  before,
much  to  my  amazement  and  puzzlement,  the  "trails"  are  groomed   for
snowmobiles more often than the roads are plowed for vehicles.

 In any event, once I made it to the Sno-Park, the skiing was perfect and  I
enjoyed actually being able to glide  along,  even  on  the  beginning  flat
road. About 1.5 miles in, I turned right up  a  road  marked  Cedar  Cr  and
began a steady climb for  another  1.5  miles  to  a  junction,  with  fresh
snowmobile tracks, that connects with  the  Elk  Heights  Sno-Park.  I  took
another left at 4 miles on the loop road to Osborn and Taneum  Points.  This
section was very nice as it meandered along the edge of the ridge with  good
views at both points.  Then, for some variety, after  Taneum  Pt  I  took  a
little crosscountry shortcut over a bump in the ridge to reconnect with  the
N section of the loop road. The terrain was  very  friendly  and  the  trail
breaking  wasn\'t  too  bad  leading  me  to  conclude  there  may  be   more
possibilities for off road travel in this area,  even  with  heavy  snowfall
elsewhere.

I did run into about a dozen or so snowmobiles in the  course  of  the  day.
Not enough to really be annoying, except for the  one  that  almost  ran  me
over. He came racing around a blind corner and  because  of  the  terrain  I
couldn\'t hear him coming until the last minute.  I jumped out of the way  in
time but he came within a couple feet of hitting  me.  What  an  ignominious
end to my outdoor career that would have been -  flattened  by  my  favorite
machine. One could argue that  it  was  my  own  fault  for  entering  their
territory and taking my chances. But then again,  I  could  just  as  easily
have been another snowmobile. If that had been the case I doubt a  collision
could have been avoided.

My entire route was groomed (except, of course the short crosscountry  bit).
And once back to the junction from the Elk  Heights  Sno-Park  is  was  even
freshly groomed since I had  been  on  it  in  the  morning.  Not  a  single
snowmobile track marred  its  surface.  Did  they  groom  it  just  for  me?
Whatever, I had a delicious smooth fast run down to Road  33,  probably  the
best road run I have had this season. I  then  had  a  flat  1.5  miles  the
remaining distance to the car but even that was "track" skiing at its  best.


The road out was still not plowed.

Total: 15.5 miles, 2050 ft and 6:20 hours

Lone Tree Mtn (4640+ ft - 920P - Tower Rock Quad) - January 17, 2008

I really wanted to ski up Greenhorn Buttes on this day  but  I  was  stopped
very near the start of Road 77 by a small downed tree and  for  some  reason
the saw I usually carry in my car was missing.  So I went to Plan B.   Again
I was stopped by a downed tree at 2100 ft on Road 55 leading  to  Lone  Tree
Mtn, but by this elevation the snow was deep  enough  to  ski  so  I  didn\'t
mind.  There were a couple of inches of fresh powder over a crust that  made
for excellent road skiing and I made fast work  of  the  3.5  miles  to  the
junction with the Lone Tree Mtn Road.  I then took a spur left  thinking  it
would be more direct and faster than the circuitous main road. Yeah,  right!
Not only did the spur dead-end far from my objective but I proceeded to  get
completely twisted around (even using my GPS) and managed to take an  almost
more circuitous route. The visibility was such that I couldn\'t see  where  I
was going and ended up on a narrow steep ridge I  couldn\'t  easily  get  off
of.  A GPS will tell you what direction you should go but it won\'t tell  you
if it is possible to go in  that  direction.   I  couldn\'t  go  the  way  it
pointed because of the terrain. And so I wandered around for an  extra  hour
or so, eventually climbing a very steep icy slope on foot  to  get  back  on
route.

Once on the proper route I was able to follow the NE  ridge  easily  to  the
summit. But my troubles weren\'t over. I still had to get  down  and  I  sure
wasn\'t going down the way I came up. I probably should have  gone  down  the
road, but it was so long and so far out of the  way  that  I  just  couldn\'t
bring myself to do it.  And so  I  skied  straight  down  from  the  summit.
Despite tricky crust, steep sections and some mild brush, it wasn\'t a  total
disaster. I did get to see Lone Tree Lake. And once I hit the spur road  and
the main road it was a great ski down.

This was supposed to be a relatively short easy "Plan  B"  alternative,  but
it had turned out to be longer and  harder  than  I  had  anticipated  (this
frequently seems to  be  the  case).   And  to  make  matters  worse  I  had
forgotten my water bottle (don\'t ask!) and  so  had  no  liquid  refreshment
along.  I had remembered I had forgotten it (is that an oxymoron?)  about  a
mile into the trip but I wasn\'t going back for it. How long could this  trip
take - 3 or 4 hours? I could last that long.  But how about  6  hours?  That
was pushing it. By the time I reached the car I was  mighty  thirsty  and  I
downed the contents of the bottle in one big  delicious  gulp.  Total:  11.4
miles, 2800 ft and 6 hrs.

Greenhorn Buttes (4825 ft - 385P - Greenhorn  Buttes  Quad)  -  January  22,
2008

The next week I was back with saw  in  hand.  By  cutting  through  3  small
downed trees I was able to drive Road 77 to 1840 ft to where  a  very  large
downed tree stopped me.  I hadn\'t gotten as far as I would  have  liked  but
it would have to do. I was able to ski right  from  the  car,  although  the
snow cover was very thin to start. It was again a few inches of powder  over
a crust - perfect for road skiing with  very  little  trailbreaking.   Which
was a good thing as the road was quite gentle, took forever to get  anywhere
and this turned out to be a very long trip indeed.

At 6 miles I passed the turnoff to Iron Cr  Butte.  At  8  miles  I  crossed
Greenhorn Cr. At 9.6 miles I left the main road  at  a  spur  where  I  went
cross-country through an old clear-cut to the base of the  Butte.  Here  the
slope steepened and the woods thickened to where it was  better  to  proceed
on foot for the last 500 ft and .2 mile. It was quite icy in the  woods  yet
knee deep snow in the open areas. I pulled onto the open rocky  summit  just
at dusk (10.7 miles, 3400 ft, 6:30 hrs).  I used my headlamp  in  the  trees
to get back to my skis, but this was the night of a full moon  and  the  sky
was clear so much of  the  rest  of  the  way  I  skied  out  under  magical
moonlight. I do admit, though, that by the time I reached my car  at  10:00,
some of the magic was beginning to wear off. Total: 21.4 miles, 3500 ft  and
10:45 hrs.

Iron Cr Butte (4280+ ft - 560P - Greenhorn Buttes Quad) - January 24, 2008

I had wanted to climb Iron Cr Butte when I did Greenhorn Buttes, but I  lost
so much time cutting the trees on the road I ran out of time. And, truth  be
told, I doubt I would have had the energy for another peak  even  with  more
time.  So 2 days later I was back.  I figured this would  be  a  short  easy
trip, relatively speaking, so to fill out the day I first  climbed  2  blobs
nearby (Greenhorn Buttes Quad 1 (2280+)  and  2  1800+  ft).   This  had  me
starting up Road 77 at 1:00. I figured as long as  I  made  the  top  before
dark I would be fine. As I have mentioned many times  I  really  don\'t  mind
skiing down a road by headlamp. In fact I rather like it.

There had been no melting since my last trip and I was able use my  previous
tracks and I skied the 6 miles to the Iron Cr Butte turnoff in 2:50 hrs,  15
minutes faster than before. I skied the spur to the base of a clear-cut  and
skinned up it to the open south  summit  then  followed  the  ridge  to  the
wooded north summit. The north summit was definitely higher. I had a  lovely
ski down the clear-cut before needing my headlamp for the rest  of  the  way
out. The night sky was clear  but  the  moon  had  not  yet  risen.  What  a
difference 2 days makes. Having been over the track 2  more  times  made  it
noticeably faster down the gentle road than before. Total: 14.5 miles,  2500
ft, 6:40 hrs.

Big Bottom Butte (2664 ft - 1544P - Vanson Pk Quad) and Glenoma BM (2411  ft
- 611P - Cowlitz Falls Quad) - February 7, 2008

The same big dump of snow down to low elevations that has made  it  hard  to
get to higher peaks, made it possible to ski up these two lower ones. I  was
able to ski right from the car up a gated spur road  after  parking  on  the
shoulder of Anderson Road, elev 1000 ft.  It was  above  freezing  with  the
snow wet, slushy and sticky enough I didn\'t need skins all day despite  some
areas being quite steep.  In an hour I reached the 1800 ft saddle  and  went
right to the towers on Big Bottom Butte  (2.7  miles,  1700  ft,  2hrs).  No
views as it was now snowing and blowing  and  I  couldn\'t  see  a  thing.  I
quickly retreated to the more protected saddle to clean  my  glasses.  While
wiping the left lens it came out in my hand.  The  frame  screw  had  worked
loose, fallen out and now, of course, was hopelessly lost. Darn. Due to  the
low light conditions I was wearing my regular glasses. I now switched to  my
sunglasses. I would deal with how to get my regular glasses  functional  for
the drive home in the dark later.

From the saddle I went in the opposite direction of Big Bottom, following  a
road that didn\'t show on my map and that I hoped would  get  me  to  Glenoma
BM. What it did was climb around an initial bump to a large  flat  clear-cut
where I was able to follow a series of roads to  where  I  could  enter  the
trees and take the broad west ridge to the summit (5.7  miles,  2500  ft,  4
hrs.). I had a pretty good run, for the most part, back to car where it  was
raining.  I still had to put the lens back in my glasses. My  first  thought
was to use a screw  from  my  sunglasses  but  it  needed  a  tiny  Phillips
screwdriver, which of course I didn\'t have (my regular glasses used  a  tiny
normal screwdriver which could be faked by a knife  blade  in  a  pinch).  I
ended up taping the lens in place. It wasn\'t pretty  but  it  got  me  home,
where I have proper tools and spare screws. Total: 9 miles, 2550  ft  and  6
hrs.

Randle Area Ski Tours

The vast area south of Randle has heretofore been completely  unexplored  by
me in the winter.  Many of the peaks have roads to or near  the  summit  and
thus are ideal for ski  ascents.  In  addition,  the  area  is  infrequently
travelled by others.  Unless starting from one of  the  few  Sno-Parks,  you
can almost count on being alone.  I met no one on any  of  these  trips  nor
saw any signs of other human passage;  on  foot,  snowshoes,  skis  or  even
snowmobiles, which really surprised me.

Lone Tree Mtn (4640+ ft - 920P - Tower Rock Quad) - January 17, 2008

I really wanted to ski up Greenhorn Buttes on this day  but  I  was  stopped
very near the start of Road 77 by a small downed tree and  for  some  reason
the saw I usually carry in my car was missing.   So  I  went  to  "Plan  B".
Again I was stopped by a downed tree at 2100 ft on Road 55 leading  to  Lone
Tree Mtn, but by this elevation the snow was deep enough to ski so I  didn\'t
mind.  There were a couple of inches of fresh powder over a crust that  made
for excellent road skiing and  I  quickly  covered  the  3.5  miles  to  the
junction with the Lone Tree Mtn Road.   Soon  after,  I  took  a  spur  left
thinking it would be more direct and faster than the circuitous  main  road.
Yeah, right! Not only did the spur dead-end far  from  my  objective  but  I
proceeded to get  completely  twisted  around  despite  using  my  GPS,  and
managed to take an almost equally circuitous route. The visibility was  such
that I couldn\'t see where I was going and ended up on a steep  narrow  ridge
I couldn\'t easily get off of.  A  GPS  will  tell  you  what  direction  you
should go but it won\'t tell you if it is possible to go in  that  direction.
I couldn\'t go the way it pointed because of the terrain.  And so I  wandered
around for an extra hour or so, eventually climbing a very steep  icy  slope
on foot to get back on route.

Once on the proper route I was able to follow the NE  ridge  easily  to  the
summit. But my troubles weren\'t over. I still had to get  down  and  I  sure
wasn\'t going down the way I had come up. I  probably  should  have  followed
the road down, but it was so long and so far out of  the  way  that  I  just
couldn\'t bring myself to do it.  Instead I skied straight  off  the  summit.
Despite tricky crust, steep sections and some mild brush, it wasn\'t a  total
disaster.  After all I did get to see Lone Tree Lake. And  once  I  hit  the
spur road and the main road it was a great run down.

This was supposed to be a relatively short easy "Plan  B"  alternative,  but
it had turned out to be longer and harder  than  I  had  anticipated  (which
frequently seems to  be  the  case).   And  to  make  matters  worse  I  had
forgotten my water bottle (don\'t ask!) and  so  had  no  liquid  refreshment
along.  I had remembered I had forgotten it about a mile into the  trip  but
I wasn\'t going back for it. How long could this trip take - 3 or 4 hours?  I
could last that long without drinking.  But how  about  6  hours?  That  was
pushing it. By the time I reached the car I was mighty thirsty and I  downed
the contents of the forgotten bottle in one big continuous  delicious  gulp.
Total: 11.4 miles, 2800 ft and 6 hrs.

Greenhorn Buttes (4825 ft - 385P - Greenhorn  Buttes  Quad)  -  January  22,
2008

The next week I was back with saw  in  hand.  By  cutting  through  3  small
downed trees I was able to drive Road 77 to 1840 ft to where  a  very  large
downed tree stopped me.  I hadn\'t gotten as far as I would  have  liked  but
it would have to do. I was able to ski right  from  the  car,  although  the
snow cover was very thin to start. It was again a few inches of powder  over
a crust - perfect for road skiing with  very  little  trailbreaking.   Which
was a good thing as the road was  quite  gentle  and  took  forever  to  get
anywhere. For long trips like this I enter a Zen state of mind  where  I  am
totally lost in the perpetual motion of gliding.

At 6 miles I passed the turnoff to Iron Cr  Butte.  At  8  miles  I  crossed
Greenhorn Cr. At 9.6 miles I left the main road  at  a  spur  where  I  went
cross-country through an old clear-cut to the base of the  Butte.  Here  the
slope steepened and the woods thickened to where it was  better  to  proceed
on foot for the last 500 ft and .2 mile. It was quite icy in the  woods  yet
knee deep snow in the open areas. I pulled onto the open rocky  summit  just
at dusk (10.7 miles, 3400 ft, 6:30 hrs) and so missed out on views.  I  used
my headlamp in the trees to get back to my skis, but this was the  night  of
a full moon and the sky was clear so much of the  rest  of  the  way  out  I
skied under magical moonlight. I do  admit,  though,  that  by  the  time  I
reached my car at 10:00, some of the  magic  was  beginning  to  wear  thin.
Total: 21.4 miles, 3500 ft and 10:45 hrs.

Iron Cr Butte (4280+ ft - 560P - Greenhorn Buttes Quad) - January 24, 2008

I had wanted to climb Iron Cr Butte when I did Greenhorn Buttes, but I  lost
so much time cutting the trees on the road I ran out of time. And, truth  be
told, I doubt I would have had the energy for another peak  even  with  more
time.  So 2 days later I was back.  I figured this would  be  a  short  easy
trip, relatively speaking, so to fill out the day I first  climbed  2  blobs
nearby (Greenhorn Buttes Quads 1 (2280+ ft) and 2 1800+ ft).   This  had  me
starting up Road 77 at 1:00. I figured as long as  I  made  the  top  before
dark I would be fine. As I have mentioned before many times I  really  don\'t
mind skiing down a road by headlamp. In fact I rather like it,  which  is  a
good thing as I seem to be doing a lot of it lately.

There had been  no  melting  since  my  last  trip  with  cold  temperatures
preserving the lovely powder and I was able use my previous tracks. I  skied
the 6 miles to the Iron Cr Butte turnoff in  2:50  hrs,  15  minutes  faster
than before. Here I skied the spur to the base of a  clear-cut  and  skinned
up it to the open south summit then followed the ridge to the  wooded  north
summit. The north summit was definitely higher.  I had  a  lovely  ski  down
the clear-cut before needing my headlamp for the rest of the  way  out.  The
night sky was clear but the moon had not yet  risen.  What  a  difference  2
days makes. Having been over the track  2  more  times  made  it  noticeably
faster down the gentle road than before. Total:  14.5  miles,  2500  ft  and
6:40 hrs.

Big Bottom Butte (2664 ft - 1544P - Vanson Pk Quad) and Glenoma BM (2411  ft
- 611P - Cowlitz Falls Quad) - February 7, 2008

The same big  dump  of  snow  down  to  low  elevations  that  now  made  it
impossible to get to my higher objectives made it possible to ski  up  these
two lower ones. I was able to ski right from the car up a  gated  spur  road
after parking on the shoulder of Anderson Road, elev 1000 ft.  It was  above
freezing with the snow wet, slushy and sticky enough  I  didn\'t  need  skins
all day despite some areas being quite  steep.  I  did  have  some  moderate
trailbreaking though. In an hour I reached the 1800 ft  saddle  between  the
two peaks and went right to the towers on Big Bottom Butte (2.7 miles,  1700
ft, 2 hrs). No views as it was now snowing and blowing and I couldn\'t see  a
thing. I quickly  retreated  to  the  more  protected  saddle  to  clean  my
glasses. While wiping the left lens it came out in my hand. The frame  screw
had worked loose, fallen out and now, of course, was hopelessly lost.  Darn!
Due to the low light conditions I was wearing  my  regular  glasses.  I  now
switched to my sunglasses. I would deal with how to get my  regular  glasses
functional for the drive home in the dark later.

From the saddle I went in the opposite direction of Big Bottom, following  a
road that didn\'t show on my map and that I hoped would  get  me  to  Glenoma
BM. What it did was climb around an initial bump to a large  flat  clear-cut
where I was able to pick up a series of roads to  where  I  could  take  the
broad west ridge through the trees to the summit  (5.7  miles,  2500  ft,  4
hrs.).  I had a pretty good run, for the most part, in  my  tracks  back  to
car where it was raining.  I still had to put the lens back in  my  glasses.
My first thought was to use a screw from my sunglasses but it needed a  tiny
Phillips screwdriver, which of course I  didn\'t  have  (my  regular  glasses
used a slotted screwdriver which could at least be faked by  a  knife  blade
in a pinch). I ended up taping the lens in place. It wasn\'t  pretty  but  it
got me home, where I had proper tools and  spare  screws.  Total:  9  miles,
2550 ft and 6 hrs.

Burley Mtn (5304 ft - 1184P) and Tower Rock (3335 ft -  95P)  -  Tower  Rock
Quad - February 14, 2008

I had to wait  for  the  snow  to  consolidate  from  recent  storms  before
attempting this peak and consolidate it did to  the  point  of  frozen  rain
crust. At least that meant I wouldn\'t have  any  trailbreaking,  although  I
did have to use skins right away. I started at the junction of Roads 76  and
7605, elev 1273. I could possibly have driven a mile farther  up  Road  7605
to 1900 ft (another vehicle had) but didn\'t think it worth the risk  on  the
steep icy road, especially considering I had passed  a  logging  truck  that
had slid on a slick patch and crashed into the snow  bank  on  Hwy  7  above
Morton on the drive over.

I have long wanted to stand  on  the  top  of  Tower  Rock,  which  is  very
impressive looking from the north but gentle on the  south,  and  thought  I
could work that into this trip. At about 4 miles where  a  switchback  comes
closest to the Rock, I  left  the  road  and  headed  into  the  woods.  The
contours indicated a fairly steep hillside, but other than the  crossing  of
2  ravines  that  required  brief  step  kicking,  the  terrain  was  easily
traversed on skis. I left my skis below the south side and kicked  steps  up
the final hundred feet to the open summit (5 miles, 2400 ft, 3 hrs). On  the
west end of the ridge were several memorial crosses. Care was  needed  along
this slightly corniced ridge, as one misstep would mean a plunge of  over  a
thousand feet down the sheer north face.

From the Rock I  continued  cross-country  south  up  the  wooded  ridge  to
intersect the road again higher up at 4000 ft. From this point on there  was
enough fresh snow over the crust (2-3 inches) for very nice skiing, that  is
until I left the road to strike out directly for  Burley\'s  summit.  The  NW
ridge was wind scoured down to a very hard  icy  crust  that  my  ski  edges
barely held on. I reached the protection of the historic Burley Mtn  Lookout
at 4:30 (8 miles, 4700 ft, 6 hrs) and was blown away (no pun intended as  it
wasn\'t that windy) by the superb 360 degree view.  This has  to  be  one  of
the best viewpoints in all of the South Cascades. NW was Mt Rainier,  SW  Mt
St Helens and SE Mt Adams, all bigger than life.  Several  plaques  sticking
out of the snow identified many of the peaks in-between.

I found friendlier slopes than the NW ridge to return to road and  even  got
in a few turns before a fun fast run down the road itself until  I  ran  out
of the fresh snow. I had actually been quite worried  about  descending  the
crusty road, but other than a short transition zone  that  never  got  above
freezing and required continuous snowplowing, I was happy  to  discover  the
lower road had thawed and softened to the point where  it  too  made  for  a
pleasant run down - the last bit, of course, by headlamp.  Total: 16  miles,
4700 ft and 9 hrs.

Greenhorn Buttes 1 (2280+ ft - 680P) and Greenhorn Buttes 2 (1800+ ft -
440P) - Greenhorn Buttes Quad - January 24, 2008

I have driven past these 2 blobs for years while on the way to bigger
things always hoping to add one or the other at the end of the day but
never having the time. This time my plan was to do them BEFORE my bigger
objective.

I started with Greenhorn2 driving Road 2303 off Road 23 around the north
and east sides to a high point at 1520 ft. I needed 4 wheel drive to get
this far in snow.  I then hiked a blocked overgrown spur a short ways
before heading crosscountry through reasonable forest to a northern high
point. I wandered south to another bump but it turned out to be lower.  1
mile, 425 ft and :55 hrs RT.

For Greenhorn 1 I the road shown on the map going to the top was not
drivable.  Instead I drove Road 2306 until directly under the summit at a
small clear-cut, then went straight uphill running into the old road twice.
 It essentially went over the summit. 1 mile, 720 ft and :52 hrs RT

It felt good to finally get these two bumps. I went on to ski up Coal Cr
Butte to fill out the rest of the day.

Kiona Pk 2 (1840+ ft - 480P - Kiona Pk Quad), Randle 4 (1648 ft - 608P -
Randle Quad) and Cowlitz Falls 2 (1520+ ft - 600P - Cowlitz Falls Quad) -
February 12. 2008

Stefan and I had scoped out the first 2 of these peaks after climbing  Kiona
3 (also 1840+ ft) and Randle 3 (1808 ft) in December but  ran  out  of  time
and incentive to crash wet brush. We were able to drive the quarry  road  to
the east side of Kiona 2 but I unexpectedly  found  this  road  gated  shut.
Instead I parked on Bowen Road on the west side a short  distance  from  Hwy
12 and went up pleasant woods at the edge  of  the  clear-cut  clearly  seen
from below. I hit a logging road on the ridge, coming from the south,  which
I followed to a cat track that went to the summit. Some  snow.   1.1  miles,
840 ft 1:14 hrs RT.

For Randle 4 I parked at the gate to the old dump on the west, went  through
lovely woods to soon intersect a rough new  looking  muddy  road  coming  up
from the north.  From here the peak appears quite steep with  mossy  cliffs.
I stuck with the road which, unlikely as it appeared from  below,  continued
switchbacking  up  the  west  side  then  circled  past  the  cliffs  as  it
deteriorated to an overgrown cat track and climbed the south side almost  to
the very top. What luck. Without this track the brush would have  been  very
unpleasant. As I was descending the road, I  heard  a  motor  coming  uphill
toward me. Oh no. Caught again.  But I had  encountered  no  no  trespassing
signs although I was clearly on private property. Soon  a  young  man  on  a
quad appeared followed by  his  father  on  foot.  They  were  the  property
owners, had seen me from below and wanted to know what I  was  up  to.  They
were actually very friendly and we  had  a  pleasant  conversation.  When  I
explained that I was just out  hiking  and  peakbagging,  they  even  seemed
pleased that I appreciated the beauty of their surroundings and  invited  me
to start from their home next time. I doubt  I  will  ever  be  back  but  I
appreciated the offer. 1.5 miles, 760 ft  and  1:18  hrs  including  the  15
minute conversation.

I drove Falls Road several miles to a  junction  with  a  sign  for  Cowlitz
Falls Dam and parked. Up to now the weather had been good, but as I  started
up Cowlitz 2, it began to  rain  lightly.  I  crossed  an  open  field  with
strange abandoned structures to a power line road and followed  it  a  short
distance until I found a reasonable spot to  head  uphill  through  moderate
brush. I crossed a snowy road 2 times but it seemed more expedient  to  just
continue uphill until I hit the nondistinct  summit  area.  By  the  time  I
returned it was raining harder and the brush was all wet. 1.1 miles, 630  ft
and 1:24 hrs RT.

I had hoped to give Vanson Pk 2 (1560+  ft)  a  try  but  I  could  find  no
drivable road to get me  close  enough  for  a  quick  sprint  in  the  ever
increasing rain ,so I called  it  a  day  despite  it  being  only  3:30.  I
actually drove all the way home before it got dark.

Randle Area Blobs

This is a companion TR to my recent Randle Area Ski Trips. Logically, Big
Bottom Butte and Glenoma BM should also be considered blobs, but since I
was able to ski all the way up them I included them with the ski trips.

Greenhorn Buttes 1 (2280+ ft - 680P) and Greenhorn Buttes 2 (1800+ ft -

coming from the south, which I followed to a cat  track  that  went  to  the
summit. Some snow.  1.1 miles, 840 ft 1:14 hrs RT.

For Randle 4 I parked just off Hwy 12 at the gate to the  old  dump  on  the
west, went through lovely woods to soon intersect a rough new looking  muddy
road coming up from a house on the north.  From here the peak appears  quite
steep with mossy cliffs.  I stuck  with  the  road  which,  unlikely  as  it
appeared from below, continued switchbacking up the west side  then  circled
past the cliffs as it  deteriorated  to  an  old  overgrown  cat  track  and
climbed the south side almost to the  very  top.  What  luck.  Without  this
track the brush would have been  very  unpleasant.  Some  views.  As  I  was
descending the road, I heard a motor coming uphill toward me. Oh no.  Caught
in the act.  But I had not encountered any No Trespassing signs  although  I
was clearly on private property.  Soon  a  young  man  on  an  ATV  appeared
followed by his father on foot. They were the property owners, had  seen  me
from below and wanted to know what I was up  to.  They  were  actually  very
friendly and we had a pleasant conversation. When I  explained  that  I  was
just  out  hiking  and  peakbagging,  they  even  seemed  pleased   that   I
appreciated the beauty of their surroundings and invited me  to  start  from
their home next time. I doubt I will ever be  back  but  I  appreciated  the
offer. 1.5 miles, 760 ft and 1:18 hrs including the 10 minute conversation.

I then drove Falls Road several miles to a junction with a sign for  Cowlitz
Falls Dam and parked. Up to now the weather had been good, but as I  started
up Cowlitz 2, it began to  rain  lightly.  I  crossed  an  open  field  with
strange abandoned structures to a power line track and followed it  a  short
distance until I found a reasonable spot to  head  uphill  through  moderate
brush. I crossed a snowy road 2 times but it seemed more expedient  to  just
continue uphill until I hit the nondistinct  summit  area.  By  the  time  I
returned it was raining harder and the brush was all wet. 1.1 miles, 630  ft
and 1:24 hrs RT.

I had hoped to give Vanson Pk 2 (1560+  ft)  a  try  but  I  could  find  no
drivable road to get me  close  enough  for  a  quick  sprint  in  the  ever
increasing rain ,so I called  it  a  day  despite  it  being  only  3:30.  I
actually drove all the way home before it got dark.

Vanson Pk 1 (2320+ ft - 560P) & Vanson Pk 2 (1560+ ft - 640P)  -  Vanson  Pk
Quad; and Rainy BM (2040+ ft - 760P - Kiona Pk Quad) - February 19, 2008

Sometimes these little blobs can be deceiving. They look so easy on the  map
but by the time I got done with these three  I  had  accumulated  some  14.5
miles, 4350 ft and 9:15 hrs (not counting transitions), a full  day\'s  work.
Since there had been a fair amount of lowland melting of snow, I  brought  a
bike along on this trip plus skis, just in case.

First up was Vanson 1.  I started from the gated logging road on a bike  and
got to a road junction at 1880 ft before  hitting  continuous  snow.  I  had
carried skis up on the bike and skied the rest  of  the  way  to  top.  Even
though it was quite warm,  it was still early enough that snow open  to  the
night sky that had frozen overnight due to radiation  cooling  had  not  yet
thawed. Protected areas were already getting  soft.  No  Views.  5.5  miles,
1610 ft and 2:30 hrs.

For Vanson 2  I had planned on biking a gated logging road I had noticed  on
my last visit that went to the base of the peak on the north side. But  when
I got to the road the gate was open and obviously in heavy  use.   A  loaded
logging truck was nearby and a fast moving dump truck almost took me out  as
it careened onto the main road without even stopping to see  if  anyone  was
coming. No way was I going to bike that road.  Instead I parked at a  gravel
pit along the main road directly opposite the summit  and  walked  across  a
vast wasteland clear-cut. Part way across I ran smack into a  curious  high-
fenced plot with some sort of protected planting. Even though it was in  the
way and I had to walk around it, it wasn\'t all bad as the  fence  line  made
for better walking than the clear-cut.

I could hear and see active logging to my left at the  base  of  Vanson  2\'s
east peak and logging trucks were moving to and fro along  the  road  I  had
originally intended to bike. I was afraid someone might spot me  and  object
to my being near their operation, but once I crossed  the  road,  I  entered
new growth forest of 15-20 ft high  trees  and  I  was  no  longer  visible.
Travel here was not too bad with many  pathways  between  the  young  trees.
Once on the ridge, I followed it to the  high  point.   Nice  views  if  you
ignored the wastelands. I ran into a road just before the summit  coming  up
from the south. If one could figure out where this road came from  it  would
be possible to bike all the way to the top. However, I could  also  hear  an
active logging operation on that side. Poor Vanson 2. Soon it would  be  one
continuous clear-cut.

From the summit, I peered to the east peak and I feared it might be  higher.
 According to the map it was not.  Still I felt I had to go over  to  it  to
make sure. It was father and more dangerous than it looked,  but  the  first
part was also quite fun as I followed a rough path along  the  narrow  rocky
crest that still had some trees. The problem was the closer  I  got  to  the
east peak the closer  I  got  to  the  upper  part  of  the  active  logging
operation. When I began running into freshly cut trees right on  the  ridge,
I began to get worried. When I practically stumbled  over  a  huge  chainsaw
and a gas can, I knew I should get out of there. All  I  needed  was  to  be
crushed by a newly felled tree because no one knew I was there. But  nothing
came crashing down and I saw no one. I believe I hit the  time  (3:00)  just
as the loggers were quitting for the day. Had I been a little earlier, I  am
sure I would have run into someone or something worse.  I  did  get  to  the
high point of the east peak but it was not higher than the west peak  so  it
was all for naught. I think it looked higher  because  it  still  had  large
trees on it.  2.2 miles, 1050 ft and 2:25 hrs.

Even though it was now after 4:00 I thought I had time  for  Rainy  BM.  The
weather was holding and it was  close  to  the  full  moon.  I  did  take  a
headlamp though. I started on bike from the gated  logging  road  off  Kiona
Road, elev 840 ft, but only got to 1440 ft before being stopped  by  a  long
snow patch. I hadn\'t expected snow so soon. This  time  I  didn\'t  bring  my
skis,  not  that  they  would  have  helped  that  much  as  the  snow   was
intermittent for the next mile and when the snow did get deeper  there  were
too many obstacles. Snowshoes would have been nice but I  didn\'t  have  them
along.  I continued on foot.   At  a  broad  saddle  at  1760  ft  the  road
descended slightly, then climbed a bit to end in  an  old  clear-cut.   Here
things deteriorated to horrendous postholing in knee deep and  deeper  slush
through logging slash. It took over an hour to go the  last  .3  mile.  Then
just below the summit I ran into a good road. I have no idea where  it  came
from. Maybe I missed a turn somewhere  or  it  came  in  from  the  east.  I
reached the summit at 6:40. This was probably the best viewpoint but  all  I
saw were the lights of civilization along Hwy 12.  The  full  moon  kept  me
company for the 2 hour trip out.  7 miles, 1680 ft and 4:20 hrs.

Grass Mtn (4382 ft - 902P) and Grass Mtn #2 (3980 ft - 380P) - Cyclone Cr
Quad - January 31, 2008

Record mountain snowfall, lowland snow with  resulting  traffic  woes,  pass
closures, avalanche warnings - what\'s a backcountry skier to do?  Ski  areas
close to home that are normally not skiable, that\'s  what,  like  this  tour
barely 10 miles east of Enumclaw that turned out to  be  a  real  gem  (well
mostly). Grass Mtn itself does  often  have  enough  snow  to  ski  but  you
normally can\'t get to it as the access roads on  private  timber  lands  are
gated at Hwy 410. To ski right from the highway requires unusually  low  and
heavy snow.

I began with a reconnaissance trip on January 29. I  had  a  choice  of  two
access roads, one from gate 1494 and one  from  gate  1460.  Gate  1494  was
open, the road plowed  and  an  active  logging  operation  in  progress  so
scratch that one. On to gate 1460. That road was also plowed  but  the  gate
was closed and there was enough fresh snow to  make  the  road  skiable.  In
fact the skiing was great. I followed the plowed road for 2 miles to a  spur
road left that climbed steeply toward Grass Mtn ridge. This road had  a  few
downed trees but they were no problem. The snow was fantastic  light  powder
and no great impediment to breaking trail, but it snowed all  day  long  and
the wind was ferocious. At times I was almost blown away. I called it a  day
at a highpoint of 4200 ft on a small bump and had a fantastic run back  down
the  road.  In  many  places  my  uphill  tracks  were  already   completely
obliterated by the fresh snow and wind. I did determine there was  a  cutoff
road, that did not show on my map, from my highpoint to the main  Grass  Mtn
ridge. 10.5 miles, 3000 ft and 6:45 hrs for this day.

Now that I had a route figured out, I returned two days later determined  to
get all the way to both Grass Mtns. I knew it would be a very long day so  I
got an early start. There was more snow at  the  gate  than  last  time  but
unfortunately it was very wet and heavy. This posed no problem until I  left
the plowed road where I soon determined trailbreaking  could  be  an  issue.
Fortunately as I climbed higher the snow got better and more windpacked  and
trailbreaking easier. There  was  little  sign  of  my  previous  tracks.  I
reached the cutoff road to the ridge at 12:00.

 It was again windy, though not quite as bad as  before,  and  again  snowed
heavily most of the day. I wasn\'t sure what it would be like on  the  ridge,
but it turned out to be absolutely delightful.  The  road  wandered  up  and
down along the ridge  through  a  corridor  of  mature  trees  that  offered
protection from the wind and was much more scenic than  expected.  The  snow
was wonderful also, fun to make fresh tracks through, and I greatly  enjoyed
this section of the trip. I reached the  tower  on  Grass  Mtn  at  1:45  (7
miles, 3300 ft, 5 hrs).

If I had ended the trip here  it  would  have  been  a  most  pleasant  trip
indeed. But it was still early, an untrod summit called and I  have  trouble
knowing when to quit, so on I went. I dropped directly off the  summit  down
the initially steep ridge on a supposed road but you could hardly  tell  one
was there. This section was open, windy, lightly corniced  and  fluted,  and
what with the heavy snowfall, wind and low visibility made  for  challenging
skiing. I could barely see where I was going. I made it down to the  gentler
ridge below and tried to stay on it, but in this section the ridge road  was
not all that obvious and at some point I got off onto a spur that  ended  up
going downhill to the left and then went the wrong direction. By the time  I
discovered my error I didn\'t want to reverse. I had to drop to a  low  point
of 3600 ft at some point anyway, so I just kept dropping XC until  I  hit  a
lower road which then traversed to the 3600 ft saddle. After a  short  climb
I came upon a good road coming in from the right that led the  rest  of  the
way to the fantastically rimed tower on Grass Mtn #2 (10.2  miles,  4000  ft
and 7:30 hrs).

It was now 4:30 and I had an awfully long ways to go to get  out.  I  had  a
good run off Grass #2 and nice track skiing along  the  ridge  and  traverse
side road until I came to the end of my tracks  at  which  point  I  had  to
break fresh trail until I hit Road 5200. Here I made  the  fateful  decision
to continue downhill rather than climb 500 ft back to the ridge  and  my  in
tracks. Bad mistake. But I was getting tired, the lure of  gravity  was  too
great and my map showed a series of roads that would get me back  to  my  up
route on a lower traverse.

I did have a good run down Road 5200 until I hit  the  junction  and  turned
onto Road 6200. Here is where it all fell apart. This  road  is  maddeningly
flat and took forever to get anywhere. Add to  that  trailbreaking  in  ever
increasingly wet heavy snow and I swear it felt like I was going uphill  the
entire 4.2 miles despite the fact that the road lost close to 1000  feet  in
elevation. At one  point  I  became  so  frustrated  that  I  cut  the  last
switchback, despite having to wallow through snowy brush on  foot,  just  to
break the monotony and use different muscles. I lost all sense of  time  yet
still felt the hours slip away. Then I discovered the last road  that  would
connect with my  up  route  no  longer  goes  through  but  is  blocked  and
impassible. Probably the bridge over Cyclone Cr is  out  and  has  been  for
while as the road remnant past the block was terribly overgrown.  I  had  no
choice but to reverse and follow Road 6200 out to Hwy 410. I  soon  came  to
the active logging operation and freshly plowed portion  of  the  road  that
made the last Â½ mile unskiable. I thought I was also going to have  to  walk
410 the 1.2 miles back to my car but there was enough snow on  the  shoulder
to ski. I wonder what the few cars that  drove  by  thought  of  that  crazy
person skiing along the highway at that late hour and I kept hoping a  State
Trooper would come along and offer me ride. No such luck. I reached  my  car
at 10:30. At least I had a short drive home.

20.5 miles, 4400 ft and 13:30 hrs.

Long Hill (1480+ ft - 500P - Enumclaw Quad) - February 25, 2008

Thanks to Stefan, Paul and I climbed Long Hill this afternoon. His  proposed
route avoiding the Big Bad Gate worked like a charm. We met along Ryan Rd  a
little after 4 pm, Paul found a place to park his  car  lower  down,  and  I
drove mine to park in a wide spot just past the switchback. We  ducked  into
the woods at a convenient spot and worked our way downhill until  hitting  a
very muddy old road. This led to the road  going  to  the  reservoirs  which
then led to the main road from the Big Bad Gate. From this  intersection  we
essentially went straight uphill to the top. Some minor  brush  but  overall
not bad travel. The summit high point was at the far end of the  ridge.   We
started hiking at 4:30 and reached the top at 5:30.  Since  it  was  getting
dark on the way down and we didn\'t want to lose out way on the direct  route
back  to  the  car,  we  elected  to  follow  the  reservoir  road  out.  We
encountered the worse brush with stickers descending from the  reservoir  to
Ryan Road. Thankfully it was very short. We came out  just  inside  the  Big
Bad Gate and  both  took  enormous  pleasure  in  ducking  under  it  -  the
highlight of the day. We finished the trip  with  a  1.5  miles  walk  along
roads back to the car.

Total: 3.5 miles, 950 ft and 2:10 hrs.

Mitchell Hill (1300+ ft - 380P - Fall City Quad) - February 26, 2008

Now I don\'t want any comments about how there  is  a  much  shorter  way  up
Mitchell Hill from Preston on the south where you can almost  drive  to  the
top (this means you Paul - besides, you do know I  like  to  do  things  the
hard way). I know the usual goal for blobs is to find the shortest,  fastest
way up, but this route turned out to be so pleasant  and  enjoyable  that  I
can\'t help but recommend it. It is all  on  quiet  semi-forested  DNR  lands
with good hiking (or possibly biking) roads and  trails  and  absolutely  no
trespass issues. It would make a great dog walk trip.

I began at a gated DNR logging road off SE Issaquah Fall City  Road  at  240
ft. The road climbed steadily to a minor  ridge,  dropped  100  ft  off  the
other side to cross a creek and climbed once again to end at 1000 feet at  a
large pile of charred logs where there were nice  views  of  the  Snoqualmie
River Valley and snow capped North Fork  peaks.  Here  I  met  a  fellow  on
horseback training an impatient filly. We chatted  while  the  filly  danced
around anxious to get back to the barn. From here  a  trail  connected  with
another road that I took  uphill  past  a  small  (cell?)  tower.  The  road
continued but I soon left it to follow a shortcut trail  through  the  woods
to yet another (or maybe the same) road higher up that went  to  just  below
the wooded high point. This entire route goes through  no  private  property
or past no houses, but I did set off two dogs barking at a home  just  below
the top on the south side.

This finally finishes off the Fall City Quad for me.

Total: 5.75 miles, 1380 ft and 2:30 hrs.

Rampart Ridge (4100 ft), Cougar Rock (3760+ ft) and Mildred Point (5935 ft)
- Mt Rainier West Quad - March 4, 2008

I have long wanted to ski the length of Rampart Ridge all  the  way  to  Van
Trump Park.  Conditions had to be just right to give it a go - enough  fresh
snow down low to make skiing possible but not  so  much  as  to  make  trail
breaking up high a chore.  With fresh snow  and  forecast  sunshine,  I  had
thought to ski at Paradise on this day, but when I arrived at  Longmire  the
road was closed and not scheduled to open until 11 am.  Since  it  was  only
9:30 and I really didn\'t want to waste an hour and a half waiting around,  I
decided this was my opportunity for Rampart Ridge. The snow conditions  were
reasonably good with 2-3 inches new at Longmire and nearly a foot  up  high,
but the promised clearing never materialized.  It  snowed  lightly  all  day
(and night) long.

I quickly located the start of  the  trail  to  Rampart  Ridge  and  had  no
trouble sticking to it all the way to the crest. From then on it was  pretty
much lost in the snow, but  the  going  was  for  the  most  part  easy  and
pleasant along the ridge. I reached the high  point  of  4100  ft  at  11:45
where I removed my skins for the next downhill section. I  had  a  nice  run
down to a low point of 3800 ft and then began a long contour to the  top  of
Cougar Rock. In retrospect, I really shouldn\'t have taken  this  side  trip.
It looked so close on the map, but in reality  was  much  farther  and  took
much more time than anticipated as I was forced around the head of  a  steep
ravine. Along the way I looked for the Wonderland Trail, which was to be  my
exit route. I had to cross it at some point but I  never  recognized  it.  I
reached Cougar Rock at 1:30.

From Cougar Rock, I reapplied skins and ascended directly back to the  ridge
following it north along once again easy terrain,  but  trail  breaking  was
becoming more of a problem. It wasn\'t that the snow was so deep as  that  it
had a strange compactness to it that occasionally caused  my  skis  to  dive
under it and become trapped which then took effort to extricate.  Powder  it
was not.  And although pleasant this ridge is  long.  It  seemed  to  go  on
forever. I reached Point 4952 at 3:45 and left my skins on for the 200  foot
descent to the saddle below. Past this saddle was a  steep  400  ft  section
before I finally broke out into the open meadows of  Van  Trump  Park.  Even
though visibility was limited, it was a  lovely  place.  I  reached  Mildred
Point at 6:00, a wee bit later than I had planned. Good  thing  I  had  just
recharged my headlamp. I was certainly going to need it - once again.

I had a good run off Mildred Point and down Van Trump Park and it  was  even
surprisingly good down the steep section of ridge during which I  still  had
light to see. And then I was confronted with the  climb  back  up  to  Point
4952. I stubbornly decided not to put skins on  again  thinking  that  would
save time and effort. It did not and I  needlessly  struggled  a  good  half
hour up the 200 feet exhausting myself in the process. Once on top,  though,
the ski down the ridge in my uphill  tracks  was  delightful,  even  in  the
dark. That is until my tracks diverged  toward  Cougar  Rock  and  I  headed
straight for my exit route down  the  Wonderland  Trail.  It  was  somewhere
around here that the good skiing ended.  A  combination  of  worsening  snow
conditions, fatigue, no tracks to follow anymore and less  friendly  terrain
all contributed.

At some point I did cross my contour tracks to Cougar Rock again.  At  least
I thought they were my tracks. Strange thing was  they  weren\'t  ski  tracks
anymore, they were snowshoe tracks.  My  first  thought  was  "great".  Some
snowshoers had come up the Wonderland Trail and would show me the way  down.
 Then I realized they had  come  up  the  Rampart  Ridge  Trail,  were  just
following my tracks and had returned the same way they had  come.  I  had  a
bit a chuckle wondering how long they followed my tracks  before  coming  to
the conclusion that this was one crazy skier!

Once I crossed the snowshoe tracks I continued downhill trying to  find  the
Wonderland Trail. I missed completely and ended up on  very  steep  terrain.
At one point I had to remove skis and boot down.  Somewhere around  3200  ft
I ran into the trail and followed it to the Paradise  Road.  Somehow  I  had
thought it would connect  directly  to  the  Rampart  Ridge  Trail,  but  it
doesn\'t. It crosses the road and continues on the other  side  to  Longmire.
At this point I had had enough and just walked the  now  gated  road  to  my
car, which I reached at 10:00. Longmire was pretty much deserted and  I  was
the last car in the parking lot.

Total: 14 miles, 4100 ft and 12 hrs.

Mazama Ridge (5680+ ft), McClure Rock (7360+ ft) and Panorama Point (6920+

I returned to Paradise two days after my foggy Mildred Point  trip  for  the
views I had missed. I wasn\'t going to bother sending out a  TR  but  then  I
couldn\'t resist sharing the photos.  Nothing new here but I  never  tire  of
the beauty of Mt Rainier (when you can actually see it) even if it is in  my
back yard. I combined these three points of interest to make  a  fun  mellow
loop and took my time enjoying  it.  The  fresh  snow  was  melting  in  the
morning sun and preserved in the shade making for generally good  skiing.  I
never used skins the entire trip but did need my ski  crampons  on  a  short
steep icy windblown section below McClure Rock. The ski off  Panorama  Point
was challenging for me in my light gear  as  the  snow  began  to  ice  over
quickly under afternoon clouds. The rest of the way down was delightful.

Due to construction on the new visitor center (Yes  Jim,  it  is  there  and
this time I did notice it), during the week that area is closed and  parking
is limited to the old visitor center.

8.5 miles, 2500 ft and 5:30 hrs.

Cottlers Rock (2760+ ft - 1440P - Morton Quad)  I really lucked out on this one. The road was plowed all the way to the ridge and first summit where there was a good 2-3 feet of snow. I passed 2 gates but both were open. They may possibly always be open. I am not sure. Part at least is in the Cowlitz Wildlife Area and I think open to the public. I even passed an official Peterman Hill Trailhead with a genuine trail. I must check it out some day but it was much too far from my objective to be useful for that.  Cottlers has multiple summits. After driving over the first, I parked and hiked over the other 4 through mushy snow and debris. My vote for the highest is the southern most but it is hard to tell. They are probably all within 20 ft of each other.
Moss BM (1600+ ft - 640P - Mossyrock Quad)  This was a fairly easy bike ride with no snow except some of the roads shown on my map no longer exist or barely exist. I am sure there is another route on good roads all the way starting from another point somewhere but it would be longer. I made the mistake of taking a dead-end spur to the summit ridge too soon and having to walk debris strewn woods to the top where I then found a road.  If I had stayed on the main road a little while longer I could have biked all the way to the top. 5.7 miles, 1000 ft and 2 hrs.
Mossyrock Quad 1 (2440+ ft - 680P) and Bellicum Pk (2280+ ft - 480P) - Mossyrock Quad.  These two gave me more trouble and took longer than anticipated, but only because I ran into more snow than thought and had neither snowshoes nor skis along on my bike (dumb, dumb!).  For Mossyrock 1 I was able to avoid some snow by sticking to the woods. The south side of the summit had fresh logging cuttings and debris strewn all over and was completely impenetrable. Fortunately the summit itself was clear although I had to do an end-run around to get to it. It was all snow all the way to Bellicum with no way to avoid it. I tried a spur road that looked shorter on the map but I don\'t think it was and probably should have stuck to the main road. I ended up eventually back on it anyway. It continued around the south side of Bellicum to switchback to the summit ridge but took too long to do so I went straight up through dense woods.  This peak is fairly steep near the top and has some rocky areas.  10 miles, 2600 ft and 5:15 hrs.
Fling Mtn (2880+ ft - 1720P - Morton Quad)  For completion I have included my route up this blob although I did it in January. I just never got around to writing it up. I was able to ski right from the car. Somehow I got off on a good looking spur road that then deadened below the radio tower. Rather than retreat, I forced a way to the tower road and continued on my way. I had to leave skis just below the summit and boot through thick woods to the top. It was a nice ski back down the road. 7 miles, 1300 ft and 3 hrs.

I really thought this day was going to be  a  disaster.  It  rained  heavily
most of the drive to Packwood. Then I had  to  change  plans  when  I  could
drive no farther than the Skate Cr Sno-Park at a miserably low elevation  of
1600 ft. That was too far away from the peaks along Road 47 I had  hoped  to
ski up. So it was on to Plan B. I got no higher  on  Road  46  before  being
stopped by snow at an elevation of 1520 ft, but at least here  my  objective
two peaks were closer and within  striking  range.  It  was  still  raining,
heavily, as I prepared to start and things were looking very dismal  indeed.
The snow level was supposed to be around 3500 feet and I so did not want  to
ski up 2000 feet in the pouring rain. I very nearly gave  up  on  the  whole
day, but after the long drive and with the cost of gas these days I  had  to
get something for my money. Miraculously, as soon as I stepped  outside  the
car and into my skis the rain let up. That is not to say it  was  completely
dry the rest of the day, but it never really rained hard again  and  was  so
much better than it could have been. I didn\'t even get very wet.

We have now entered that annoying time of year where there is too much  snow
low down on the approach roads for a vehicle to get through but  not  enough
consistently for good skiing.  So for the first 2 miles the snow was  patchy
with several long bare spots that required removal of skis.  Once  past  the
switchback at 2000  ft  elevation,  though,  the  snow  remained  consistent
though very slushy. At 5 miles and 2800 ft elevation (2:40 hrs) I  left  the
road, put on skins and headed up through pleasant open forest on  the  broad
ridge to the wooded summit of Ohanapecosh 3 (2800  ft,  4:20  hrs).   I  had
entered the fresh snow zone but the snow remained very  wet  and  heavy.  At
this point I decided to try to follow  the  ridge  line  to  Coal  Cr  Bluff
rather than descend back to the road, even though I knew the  route  finding
would be challenging, as that would save me 1000 feet of elevation loss  and
regain.

I had a reasonable descent to a low  point  of  3800  ft  elevation   before
entering rather confusing up and down terrain. Somehow I got  on  the  wrong
side of a deep ravine and had  to  climb  up  alongside  it  a  ways  before
finding a  way  across.  Then  began  a  very  steep  200  ft  section  that
culminated in having to kick steps past a rock wall.  Once  above  this  the
ridge gentled and made for very nice skiing all the way  to  the  summit  of
Coal Cr Bluff (4100 ft, 7:50 hrs).  There would have been  good  views  from
this peak but it was snowing lightly and I could see  nothing.  It  was  now
7:30 and would be dark soon. I seem to be making a habit lately of  reaching
my summits right at sunset, partly because of continually later  than  hoped
for starts and partly because I am always trying to fit  the  most  possible
into a day.

I didn\'t know what I would run into on a direct descent  back  to  the  road
but it turned out to be quite reasonable. The beginning even had  some  open
glades with snow good enough for a few turns -  at  least  until  it  turned
dark  enough  to  require  a  headlamp.  Lower  the  terrain  did   steepen,
particularly near Purcell Cr, at which point I  kicked  steps  down.  I  had
been worried about finding a way across this creek but luckily hit it  right
at a snow covered log bridge and had no problem. The rest of  the  ski  down
the road was less than fast considering the soggy snow, a very  gentle  road
and several ski removals for walking bare patches. Okay, so the  skiing  was
not all that great but the trip itself was. I just love it when  I  can  put
together an unknown route, especially a loop, and make it work.

Total: 15 miles, 4150 ft and 11:20 hrs.

Even though these peaks are in my back yard, I just never got around to climbing them. Part of the reason is that the access Road 7010 (elev 1870 ft) is gated at Road 70 (the Greenwater River Road) from December to May and closed to motorized vehicles to protect wildlife. This means snowmobiles are not allowed, which should make it very appealing for skiing. The problem is this area doesn\'t get that much lowland snow in a normal year and it is a very long way to the good stuff higher on the ridges. But this is anything but a normal year and for this trip snow started right at the gate. There were a few short bare patches to work through near the beginning but they were expected and not a real problem. Other than that the snow conditions were almost ideal for good road travel - consolidated enough so I didn\'t sink in but soft enough so my waxless skis worked well.
After 2.5 miles I took a right onto Road 7012. Although my main goal was to climb Divide Ridge and Huckleberry Mtn, Nagrom 1 was more or less on the way and so I took a 3 mile, 400 ft and 1:30 hr RT detour to ski up that forested peak before returning to Road 7012.  At 9.5 miles and 5 hrs I reached the 4200 ft saddle between Huckleberry Mtn and Divide Ridge and gazed into the forbidden Green River Watershed. Inviting clearcuts were all around that would provide many possibilities for very nice skiing indeed if that was all one had in mind. But I had summits to climb, first of which was Divide Ridge. I followed a spur road to its end under an interesting pinnacle, and then went up a fairly steep slope to the summit ridge. Here I was met with a surprise. What had appeared from a distance as an easy wooded ridge, turned out to be narrow and rocky with very steep slopes on either side. I had to leave skis, get out the ice axe and kick steps on the north slope. It took the better part of an hour to slowly work my way along and below the crest to the 4878 ft survey point at the east end marked on the map. This turned out to be a small open knoll in the trees but I am convinced it is not the highest point. Several of the rocky pinnacles before it appeared higher and I climbed the two most likely contenders just to make sure.
Back at the saddle I picked up another spur road that curved around Point 4758 to dead end on the south side. From here I climbed XC up to the ridge and followed it some 1.5 miles through pleasant forest to the open summit of Huckleberry Mtn (13 miles, 4800 ft and 8:40 hrs. I had an absolutely wonderful ski off this peak through open trees where several inches of powder snow were still preserved. I soon picked up Road 7010 below. This road went for miles and miles in long switchbacks but ended up also being a delightful run down. It was getting late enough in the day that sun softened snow was beginning to set up, however it was so solid and so smooth and the grade so gentle that the skiing was just fast enough to be fun but not so fast as to be treacherous. It took less than an hour to zip down the 5 miles to close my loop as I continued to hit conditions just right all day long. I even almost made it to car before dark, but things slowed the last 2.5 miles as the snow softened and became slower and the road flattened with those annoying bare spots to deal with. Still, I only needed my headlamp for 30 minutes, a big improvement over many recent trips.

As I have mentioned many times before, I am always forgetting things. It  is
getting so bad that when I start each trip I now ask myself,  "What  have  I
forgotten this time?" It doesn\'t seem to do any good,  though,  as  I  still
forget something. On this occasion I left my map in the  car.  You  think  I
would have noticed right away as I always have my map in a  case  around  my
neck and I refer to it often. But I didn\'t, and by the time I  did,  it  was
too late to go back for it. Under normal circumstances, this  wouldn\'t  have
been a total disaster as I also have my GPS along  with  maps  of  the  area
loaded onto a data card. But I had just returned from a trip to  Albuquerque
and had forgotten to change out the New Mexico card for the Washington  one.
 So two errors conspired together to leave me  with  no  reference  maps  at
all. The only thing I had to guide  me  was  my  memory  which  this  entire
discourse has just shown is not that reliable.

I have been checking on this trip for the last month or so each time  hoping
I could drive farther up the road and each time  being  stopped  at  exactly
the same place - the end of the plowed road near Teeley Cr. The  way  things
are going this spring I figured it would take till summer for  the  road  to
melt out enough to do me any good. So  this  time  I  decided  to  bite  the
bullet and just do it even though that meant starting  lower  than  I  would
have liked. Several snowmobiles were ahead of me,  which  might  be  helpful
with the recent new snow. After .7 mile on Road 52 I turned right onto  Road
84 and after another 1.5 miles onto Road 8410. The good  news  was  that  no
snowmobiles had been on this road and I would have peace and quiet. The  bad
news was that no snowmobiles had been on this  road  and  I  would  have  to
break trail after all.

After cutting a couple a switchbacks, I followed the road  into  the  Teeley
Cr basin where there were several inviting clearcuts and views  of  imposing
Sawtooth Ridge and Mt Rainier. I soon lost the road  and  couldn\'t  remember
enough of where it went to find it again so just went up  a  large  clearcut
toward the saddle in the ridge south of  Osborne  Mtn.  The  clearcut  ended
before the ridge and in the trees I misjudged where the saddle  was,  got  a
bit confused and ended up on the east ridge higher  than  I  wanted  to  be.
Once I crossed the south ridge I entered another clearcut and could see  the
road below me. Rather than descend to it I continued to follow the  corniced
east ridge to the wooded summit (6.5 miles, 3200 ft, 5:20 hrs).

I skied directly off the summit to  the  road  below  following  it  to  the
saddle and beyond until it began to veer away  from  my  intended  route  to
Sawtooth Ridge. There was good skiing in this section. I knew I had  to  get
to the south side of Sawtooth Ridge as the north side is very  cliffy.  This
entailed traversing steep slopes below the cliffs to  Bertha  May  Lake  and
then climbing the rib between that  lake  and  Granite  Lake  to  the  ridge
crest. This went well although slowly as I wandered around  finding  my  way
and breaking trail. Up here there was a good foot of new  snow  that  varied
from wet and slushy in sunny  areas  to  almost  powder  in  more  protected
places. Once on the ridge it  took  another  hour  to  traverse  below  some
wicked looking pinnacles. I was glad I didn\'t have  to  climb  any  of  them
when the summit turned out to be a gentle open point  and  I  easily  kicked
steps the last little bit to the top (10 miles, 4800 ft, 9 hrs).  It  helped
to have the summit waypoint marked on my GPS.

The trip out started well then steadily deteriorated.  The  snow  was  still
reasonable on the open traverse to where I crossed the  ridge  but  I  could
feel it was already beginning to ice over as the sun lowered in the sky.  It
remained soft in the trees down to the lake and I even got in a  few  turns.
From this point on things went from bad to  worse.  Rather  than  follow  my
tracks uphill all the way back to the road near the saddle, I  opted  for  a
more "direct" route downhill. I figured I couldn\'t miss the road and I  also
had the "breadcrumb" track on my GPS to head for, but it was just a line  on
a blank screen with no map features and every time I headed directly  toward
it, it seemed I had to go uphill. Without a map  I  got  very  confused  and
ended up wandering around quite a bit as it was now dark.  At  one  point  I
came to a large open area that at the time I thought was a  clearcut  but  I
later realized was Pothole Lake. I also had two ravines to get  across  that
I didn\'t know were there. By the time I reached  the  road  my  worst  fears
were realized when the soft snow had turned to that which  I  dread  most  -
breakable crust. I endured this hideous condition until I got lower to  more
protected and softer snow. But actually the best skiing  of  the  night  was
once I hit Road 84 and the snowmobile tracks. All things are relative.

When I reached my car the map was on the front seat right where I  had  left
it. I doubt I will be forgetting my map again anytime soon but I  will  most
likely be forgetting something else.

Total: 16 miles, 5000 ft and 14 hrs.

This turned out to be a very pleasant ski trip  despite  having  to  ski  an
unexpected additional 5 miles RT. Because  of  the  unusual  heavy  snowfall
this year, the Orr Cr  Sno-Park has been relocated to the junction of  Roads
 56 and 5601 some 2.5 miles before the normal site.

Quartz Mtn, West Peak (4487 ft - 487P - Lake  Philippa  Quad)  -  April  26,

When I climbed Quartz Mtn, many years ago, I could drive Road 120  .6  miles
to its end at the creek crossing. This time I had trouble even  finding  its
start, which has been totally obliterated. Once I did locate it,  though,  I
could easily hike the old road about half a mile to  its  intersection  with
the recent extension of the CCC Trail. I followed this good  trail  a  short
distance over two massive (expensive?) bridges and a ford of the main  creek
until I could enter open mossy forest  and  head  uphill.  Travel  here  was
pleasant for a while but it didn\'t take long to start running into snow  and
by the time I came to the first gully at 2000 ft  it  was  continuous,  deep
and very slushy.

I have very little recollection of my previous route up Quartz  even  though
I climbed that peak twice, once solo and once  with  my  son.  I  am  pretty
sure, though not positive, that I stayed low at this  point  and  worked  my
way into the main creek drainage. This time I found myself higher above  the
creek, lured ever upward and away from it by the appealing open  highway  of
this first gully. I followed it several hundred feet  until  I  got  nervous
that I might  be  trapped  and  unable  to  get  out  by  cliffs  that  were
developing along the sides, so I soon exited steeply onto  the  rib  to  the
left. Here the going was even better until I began  an  upward  traverse  at
3000 ft to get back to the main drainage. This traverse was quite  steep  in
spots, crossed 4 annoying gullies that required working  up  and  down  past
small cliffs and in general was a lot of effort and very slow going.  I  was
most relieved when I reached the more friendly terrain of  the  basin  below
Quartz Pass.

Now I had to contend with ever softening, wet slushy snow. I  had  made  the
deliberate decision not to bring snowshoes, partly because I didn\'t want  to
carry the weight and party because I really didn\'t think they  would  be  of
that much help. Despite now postholing calf deep, and  occasionally  deeper,
I didn\'t regret my decision. Most of  the  way  was  really  too  steep  for
snowshoes especially the traverses where  I  actually  find  them  to  be  a
hazard. For me breaking trail in snowshoes is as much or  more  effort  than
postholing. The only  time  they  are  really  useful  to  me  is  when  the
postholing is so deep I just can\'t make any progress at all or if I am  with
a group where someone else has already broken trail. But  remember  I  am  a
prejudiced skier.

And so I slowly postholed my way upward. Before Quartz Pass  I  veered  left
up a steep gully to the south ridge and corniced summit  of  the  West  Peak
(2.5 miles, 3700 ft, 5:30 hrs). The top was surrounded  by  trees  -  it  is
after all not  that  high  -  and  unobstructed  views  were  limited.  Most
impressive was nearby Bessemer and I managed  to  find  a  reasonably  clear
shot from the ridge. I was  most  disappointed  not  to  have  any  view  of
Garfield. It was completely hidden behind the main peak of Quartz.

I did an improved job of route finding on the way out staying lower  on  the
traverse and finding better ways across all the gullies to cut  my  up  time
in half. The ascent of this peak finishes off the  Lake  Philippa  Quad  for
me.

Total: 5 miles, 3700 ft and 8:20 hrs

Grisdale Hill (1511 ft - 151P) and Vance Cr 2 (1600+ ft - 680P) - Vance Cr

I parked at the gate on the road off Road 2340 just past Lake West. This  is
a good road that is bikeable all the way to the top of  Grisdale  Hill.  The
summit is logged but grassy and pleasant with nice views, the best  of  this
bunch. From here I could see the road continued south  along  the  ridge  to
the saddle with Vance 2 although this wasn\'t  shown  on  my  map.  The  road
ended in a clearcut where I left my bike and climbed easy slash  to  another
(old) road higher up coming from I know not where.  A  spur  off  this  road
ended a couple hundred feet from the top below  the  wooded  ridge.  It  was
fairly easy XC to the top where I found another road coming from the  south.
 Although old, it did look bikeable if you could figure out  where  it  came
from.  (6.5 miles, 1400 ft, 2:20 hrs.)

Lightning Pk 4 (1400+ ft - 400P - Lightning Pk Quad)

A short easy hike  up  steep  fairly  open  forest  starting  directly  from
parking on the shoulder of Road 23. I did find a 3 rock cairn on a stump  on
the top.  (.6 miles, 450 ft, :40 hr)



Vance Cr 1 (1930 ft - 610P - Vance Cr Quad)

I drove spur 2351 off Road 2350 to the junction with the road shown   on  my
map going up Vance 1. This road has been abandoned  and  is  not  driveable,
not bikeable and barely walkable.  Still it may  be  better  to  stick  with
this road than go the way I did. I went straight uphill through awful  brush
covering downed thinnings.  Very  slow  going.  After  much  cursing  I  did
eventually intersect a continuation of the summit  road.  It  was  not  very
good but better than what I had come up.  This led to below the  wooded  top
where a short XC section finished it off. No views. Since the  road  was  so
bad I returned the same way reasoning  shorter  greater  misery  was  better
than longer lesser misery and misery is easier going downhill.  (1.6  miles,
640 ft, 1:25 hrs.)

Vance Cr 4 (1360+ ft - 480P - Vance Cr Quad)

There must be a road up this thing as the top is logged but  I  didn\'t  have
the time or inclination to  look  for  it.  It  seemed  faster  to  just  go
straight up from Road 2350 through very steep woods. I ran into slash  right
at the summit but came across no road. It must be farther  south  along  the
ridge. (.6 miles, 540 ft, :55 hr.)

Garfield Mtn (5519 ft - 839P - Snoqualmie Lake Quad) - May 18, 2008

I had long thought to give Garfield Mtn a try via the north  side  from  the
Taylor River since I considered the notorious south side  route  beyond  me.
However, the only route on the north described in  Beckey  involves  fording
the Taylor River during high spring melt, decidedly  not  appealing  if  not
downright deadly. Then I discovered you could  get  to  the  north  side  by
traversing from Lower Garfield Mtn Lake. And this is what I did on  May  25,
2007 during a 3-day solo trip up Green Ridge to  climb  the  East  Peak  and
Treen. Unfortunately I was thwarted by an impassible moat about  halfway  up
the summit gully. Then Don Goodman informed me that the north side could  be
accessed from the Taylor River  TH  without  fording  the  Taylor  River  by
travelling XC on the south side  of  the  river  to  the  creek  draining  N
directly from the summit.  So this was to be my next plan of attack.

The main problem with the north route is that it has  only  a  small  window
during which it can be climbed. It must be done late enough  that  the  snow
is stable but early enough that the summit gully is completely snow  filled.
 Once the snow melts the gully is very difficult. This usually means  before
the middle of May. Don had good conditions on May 13, 2006. Last year I  was
already too late by May 25.  This  year  I  began  trying  to  get  a  party
together in April and joined forces with Jim Brisbine and Mike  Torok.   But
our unusual spring weather of unseasonably cold temperatures  with  constant
new snow followed by brief unseasonably high temperatures produced  a  cycle
of dangerous avalanche conditions that kept putting off the  trip.  I  could
feel the window slowly closing. Finally things  came  together  on  May  18,
though only after a last minute reconsideration after  initially  cancelling
once again due to high avalanche conditions. It  was  getting  late  to  try
this route but surely the window would stay open longer  this  year  due  to
the higher than normal snowpack. Little did we  know  that  the  window  had
already closed. It was only because Mike pried it open again with  guts  and
a shovel that we made the summit.

Following Don\'s route description, we started from the Taylor  River  TH  at
6:30 paralleling the river on the south side.  The  previous  two  days  had
been unseasonably hot and the Taylor River was a raging  torrent.  There  is
no  way  anyone  could  get  across  that  river  without  a  bridge.   This
observation and the fact that Don\'s first "dry" stream now had a  good  flow
in it warned that we might encounter some unusual conditions  on  this  day.
Sure enough, the objective second  stream  was  roaring  and  could  not  be
crossed without a log. There was a possibility very near the  junction  with
the Taylor River, but we scouted upstream looking for something  better.  We
soon  encountered  a  gorge  with  several  waterfalls  and  retreated  back
downstream to the first log. We all scooted across  and  followed  the  east
side of the creek through  pleasant  woods.  We  came  to  Don\'s  two  talus
fields, the predicted brush  and  the  diagonal  descent  down  the  top  of
treacherous dripping wet slabs into the north gully proper  at  2200  ft  (3
hrs). Here was continuous snow and extensive avalanche debris littered  with
tree parts. We could see the summit of Garfield but the summit  gully  would
not be visible until right beneath it.

The next section  of  the  route  was  delightful.  The  snow  was  in  good
condition, not at all slushy as we had feared it might  be.  Good  thing  we
hadn\'t lugged snowshoes along. They were not needed at all.  We  worked  our
way up to the 4400 ft basin directly below Garfield (5 hrs). When we  turned
a corner and the summit gully came into  view,  my  heart  sank.  It  looked
almost identical to last year with  two  major  breaks  already  across  the
gully. We were too late. Where had all this year\'s snow gone? At that  point
I all but gave up. Sure we were this far and would go  take  a  look  but  I
knew  what  we  were  going  to  find.  I  didn\'t,  however,  consider   the
determination of one of my companions.

Donning harness and crampons, we climbed to the first break,  the  same  one
that had stopped  me  last  year,  and  roped  up.  A  deep  moat  stretched
completely across the gully. There were two thin snow bridges,  one  in  the
center and one to the left perched precariously over slabs.  Jim  was  first
to inspect. He backed off both declaring neither one to his  liking.  I  was
no help either not really wanting to go any farther. I think both Jim and  I
were ready to turn around at this point and try again  another  year.  Mike,
though, did not give up so easily. He first looked  at  the  center  bridge,
didn\'t like it, looked at the left bridge, liked it even less and went  back
to the center bridge. Though narrow, it really did go down  a  ways  and  he
declared it solid enough to cross, and cross it he did while Jim and I  held
our breath fully expecting the whole fragile thing to collapse.  Guts.  That
is all I can say. Mike has guts. Even with a top rope I was totally  freaked
crossing this bridge. It was very thin, only a foot wide at  its  narrowest,
maybe 3 feet long and spanned a deep wet evil looking moat.

We still had the second break to  contend  with.  This  one  looked  totally
impassible to me with no possible way across. It wasn\'t  really  a  moat  in
the true sense as the snow went right up the rock but the rock was  vertical
with a vertical snow wall on the left  accessed  by  a  sloping  rock  slab.
Again Jim and I were ready to turn around. Again Mike  didn\'t  give  up.  He
merely pulled out his shovel and  went  to  work.  Jim  and  I  stood  there
incredulously with our mouths  open  as  Mike  spent  the  next  30  minutes
excavating a route up the vertical snow wall. This guy  is  unreal.  Such  a
technique would never in a million years have occurred to me. He did such  a
good job that I had no trouble getting up that wall.

We now thought we had it made and Jim led the rest of the way to  the  Notch
(8  hrs).   But  when  we  got  to  the  notch  it   looked   anything   but
straightforward. Where was this continuous snow Don described? What we  were
faced with was  a  series  of  wet  dripping  slabs  and  intermittent  snow
patches. It took another 1:30 to work our way, Jim leading again,  the  last
350 ft to the summit (4600 ft, 9:30 hrs).  Given what had  gone  before,  it
took a while to soak in that I was really on the summit. And yet I  couldn\'t
get too elated - yet. We still had to get down and across that snow bridge.

The summit register was soaking wet, which really  annoyed  Mike.  While  he
partially dried it out, Jim and I made 3 rappels back to the notch. Mike  is
so comfortable downclimbing that is what he did,  removing  our  anchors  on
the way down. We belayed from the notch down, Mike  coming  last.  The  only
place Mike really wanted a belay was across the snowbridge. Miraculously  we
all made it across and everyone breathed a sigh of  relief.  We  made  short
work of descending the snow to where we had to  climb  out  the  main  gully
past the wet slabs. Things slowed in the  brush  and  talus  and  forest  as
fatigue began to take its toll. We crossed the log over  the  big  creek  at
last light and did the final bit along the  river  by  headlamp,  thankfully
reaching the car at 10:20. Now we could really celebrate our  success  -  up
and down the mountain. I gave both Jim  and  Mike  a  big  grateful  hug.  I
couldn\'t have climbed Garfield without them.

North Craggy (8205 ft - 445P) and Eightmile Pk (7840+ ft  -  480P)  -  Billy
Goat Mtn Quad - June 8, 2008

Stefan, Don B, Tom S, Martin S and I started from  a  previous  night\'s  car
camp at the Billy Goat Horse TH at 7:20. Actually Stefan drove a further  .5
mile to the switchback at 4560 ft where  a  large  avalanche  pile  of  snow
blocked the road. I had checked this out the day  before  and  after  barely
being able to turn around, I elected to walk  this  section.  I  watched  in
disbelief as Stefan drove past my turnaround point, one wheel  on  the  snow
the other on the  very  edge  of  the  shoulder  to  a  wider  spot  at  the
switchback proper. I never would have had the guts to try that on my own.

From the switchback we headed up along Eightmile  Cr.  We  soon  came  to  a
curious hump in the drainage not  shown  on  the  map  and  had  to  descent
slightly on the other side.  Since water cannot flow uphill, the  creek  had
to go under this hump somehow. We continued up  the  creek  until  we  could
begin an upward traverse through talus and moderate brush toward  the  creek
draining No Dice Lake. Somewhere in here Tom went left up an  inviting  snow
couloir toward the N Ridge  while  the  rest  of  us  stayed  right  on  the
traverse. Tom reported he got quite high on the ridge in class  3-4  terrain
before being stopped by a potential rappel off a  pinnacle.  Had  he  had  a
rope, he might have continued all the way to the summit, but having none  he
descended somewhat and traversed to meet up with us above No Dice Lake.

Once we hit the drainage at about 6000 ft the terrain opened up  with  solid
snow and easy travel the rest of the way to No Dice Lake (2500 ft,  3  hrs).
This alpine basin is lovely, surrounded as it is with the three Craggys  and
Eightmile Pk. We were, however, stunned to see how little snow there was  on
the west slope of North Craggy. We  were  expecting  a  snow  climb  and  it
turned out to be mostly scree and class  2-3  rock  up  a  series  of  loose
gullies. We had to be very careful with rockfall. None of us had thought  to
bring a hardhat. About halfway up Tom intersected  our  route  and  we  were
together once again. We hit the easy S Ridge just  shy  of  the  summit  and
pulled onto the top at 12:00 (4000 ft, 4:30 hrs). What snow  there  was  was
mostly of the fresh variety from recent storms. The N  face  of  Big  Craggy
looked especially wintry with its new coat of white.

There was a film can register but I  decided  this  Top  200  peak  deserved
something better and added a large one of my own.  We spent  a  pleasant  20
minutes or so on top.  Views were quite expansive with Tom ticking  off  the
names of all the surrounding Pasayten peaks. The wind was  minimal  and  the
sun even came out briefly.  But clouds were thick to the west where I  doubt
the weather was very good. This area was certainly a good  choice  for  this
weekend.

We quickly descended, making use of a few ribbons of snow, to No  Dice  Lake
and worked our way up the other side to the S Ridge of  Eightmile  Pk.  From
this point, and from the map, the S Ridge looked  as  if  it  could  present
some problems but in fact it turned out  to  be  quite  delightful  and  fun
scrambling, mostly on the very crest, with nothing harder than class 3.   We
reached the summit at 3:00 (5500 ft, 7:30 hrs).  There was  no  register  so
again I left one of mine. More expansive  views,  including  down  into  the
remote Lost River Gorge, and more enjoyable summit time before starting  our
descent by continuing north along the ridge.

The first part of the North Ridge to  the  surveyed  7756  point  was  quite
mellow, after which it divided and took a decidedly steep  downward  plunge.
Fortunately, Stefan noticed a snowfilled gully to the left that  provided  a
fast and easy way down via a long  glissade.  Unfortunately,  what  followed
after that was unpleasant  brush  and  talus  and  forested  cliffs  through
rather confusing topography  as  Stefan,  Martin  and  I  made  our  way  to
Eightmile Pass and the trail. It took  longer  to  navigate  than  expected.
Somewhere in this brush we parted company with Don and Tom. They  never  did
find the trail, but still found a reasonable route and beat us back  to  the
car. We hit the good trail at 5:20, which was snow and obstacle free  and  a
pleasure to walk after what had gone before. We reached  the  switchback  at
6:20, where believe it or not another car  was  parked  alongside  Stefan\'s.
That made turning around for him a bit more difficult. Thanking  all  for  a
great day, I took my leave of the guys and walked the last half mile  to  my
car and a planned second car camp. They all  waved  as  they  drove  past  a
short time later.

Total: 9 miles, 5800 ft and 11 hrs.

Continued from North Craggy TR.

I had a second pleasant car camp at the Billy Goat  Horse  TH  with  a  good
night\'s sleep having the place all to myself. The lone  car  that  had  been
parked there the previous day was undisturbed and  no  other  cars  made  an
appearance. The forecast for this day was not encouraging - 60 %  chance  of
precipitation. But nothing came in during the night and I  awoke  to  partly
sunny skies. My plan was to climb Billy Goat Mtn, Billy  Goat  3  and  Burch
Mtn, although I wasn\'t quite sure how I was going to link them together.

This time I did drive to the switchback since I now knew it could  be  done,
although I turned around right away before parking next  to  the  other  car
which was still there. I started up the trail at  6:30,  reaching  Eightmile
Pass an hour later, then just headed up the S slopes toward Billy  Goat.  No
real problems other than the fact that I  felt  really  tired  and  slow.  I
guess the guys had pretty much worn me out the day before. The  terrain  was
open and snow free, except for the hidden high basin below the peak at  7100
ft, the final ridge a walkup and I reached the  top  at  9:30  (3200  ft,  3
hrs).  Despite having a huge summit cairn, I could find  no  register  so  I
left one of mine. It was warm and sunny and I spent 25 minutes relaxing  and
taking in views of the Craggys and where I had been just the day before.

Too soon, it was time to determine how I would get to Billy  Goat  Pass  and
my next two peaks. Going down the same S slopes I had ascended was not  very
appealing. Numerous pinnacles  and  cliffs  to  the  SE  would  mean  either
descending almost all the way  back  to  Eightmile  Pass  or  trying  for  a
tedious and doubtful higher traverse to the Billy Goat  Pass  trail.  Either
would involve substantial elevation loss. On the  other  hand,  if  I  could
find a way down the N slopes it would be ever so much shorter  and  I  could
essentially traverse to the  Pass  with  minimal  unneeded  elevation  loss.
Problem was the N slope looked frightfully steep on the map  and  even  more
frightful at first glance in person from the ridge. But the  more  I  looked
the more I thought I could pick out a route down. The first part was  a  bit
tricky on a loose rocky rib between steep snow gullies. I did have my 60  ft
panic rope along and two short rappels off trees got me into the  left  snow
gully at a point  where  the  steepness  lessened  and  it  appeared  to  be
continuous all the way to the valley below. Thankfully  the  snow  was  soft
and I could kick steps and glissade to 6400 ft after which an easy  traverse
led to 6600 ft Billy Goat Pass (3500 ft, 5 hrs).

At the Pass I was unable to find the Burch Mtn Trail in  the  snow  so  just
headed uphill. I did stumble onto a trail; although it was much higher  than
where the GT Map indicated it should be (this trail  is  not  shown  on  the
USGS Billy Goat Mtn Quad). At this point  I  could  see  the  predicted  bad
weather making its way toward me.  I followed  the  snow  covered  trail  to
just below Billy 3, climbed easy terrain to that summit  (4600  ft,  6  hrs)
and  left  another  register.   It  was  now  snowing  and  visibility   was
diminishing so I didn\'t tarry but hurried off to Burch reaching that  summit
at 2:00 (5400 ft, 7:30 hrs). There was no register but since  a  trail  lead
to this top I didn\'t bother to leave one.

I quickly returned to Billy Goat Pass  where  I  had  a  bit  of  difficulty
finding the trail in the snow. At one point I thought  I  saw  tracks  going
down a gully, but when I got closer they were too fat and  round  for  human
tracks. Besides they had big claws.  Definitely  bear  tracks.   Fortunately
they were not fresh so  hopefully  Mr.  Bear  was  now  far  away  from  me.
Eventually I did find the trail, although it remained snow covered to  about
5800 ft. Easy travel on real trail led to  reaching  my  car  at  5:00.  The
other car was still there.

Driving home it was sunny once again from Winthrop to Wenatchee.  I  stopped
for dinner at the Big Y CafÃ© at the Junction of Hwys 2 and 97. I hit  really
bad weather coming over Snoqualmie Pass with winds  that  buffeted  my  poor
Subaru all over the road and heavy rain  and  snow.  Yes  it  was  seriously
snowing at Snoqualmie Pass. Is this really June?

Total: 10 miles, 5600 ft and 10:30 hrs.

Ever since snowshoeing to Welcome Pass on Matt\'s trip in  February,  I  have
been dying to return to this lovely area. The view of Damfino  Pk  from  the
pass  especially  piqued  my  interest  and  I  made  this  summit  my  main
objective. I wasn\'t sure it  was  within  my  capabilities,  though,  as  it
certainly looked like a challenging  rock  climb  from  a  distance.  Beckey
describes it as only class 2-3 but I have been fooled by Beckey before so  I
wasn\'t sure what to expect. In any event there were also a couple  of  other
easier climbs along scenic Excelsior Ridge to serve  as  consolation  prizes
should I not succeed

Day 1: I started up the Welcome Pass Trail at 12:00.  There  was  one  other
car at the TH. About halfway up I met  the  couple  belonging  to  this  car
coming down. I was in shorts; they were bundled up head to  toe.  The  woman
looked at me rather incredulously and commented, "There is a lot of snow  up
there!"  "Well duh," I thought to myself, but  I  politely  answered  "I  am
expecting snow," and left it at that. Shortly after leaving them,  somewhere
around 4200 ft, I hit consistent snow. At 2:40 I  reached  5200  ft  Welcome
Pass (2.5 miles, 2800 ft, 2:40 hrs). The views were as good  as  remembered.
Well, almost. The higher mountains, including Baker,  Shuksan  and  Tomyhoi,
were still hidden under marine clouds only gradually making  their  presence
known.

The snow in the forest was rock hard, but  here  on  the  open  sun  exposed
ridge was soft and slushy. My plan was  to  wander  along  Excelsior  Ridge,
climbing Larrabee3 on the way, and find a camp near  its  intersection  with
the ridge to Damfino Pk.  Crossing the S ridge of Larrabee  3  I  dumped  my
pack and strolled up the mostly bare ridge to that summit (360  ft,  :45  hr
RT). I had a great view of Damfino Pk from the  top.  It  didn\'t  look  that
easy nor did just getting to it for that matter.

I stayed mostly on the ridge crest because  that  seemed  easier  than  side
hilling, but then had to descend a bit to the saddle with the  ridge  coming
from Pt 6087 where I wanted to make camp. Here I found a small bare  heather
patch flat enough for my tent (5 miles, 4050 ft, 5:30 total). Though it  was
a bit cramped and uncomfortable it  beat  sleeping  on  slushy  snow.  After
setting up camp I headed further west along  the  Excelsior  crest  climbing
over Bearpaw 1 to Excelsior Pk just  above  Excelsior  Pass.  Although  very
easy going the distance was farther than it looked and took more  time  than
expected (5 miles, 1700 ft, 3 hrs RT). By the time I  returned  to  camp  it
was 9:20.

Total for the day: 10 miles, 5750 ft and 9:20 hrs

Day 2: Marine air moved in again during the night and when I awoke  at  5:00
it was foggy with no visibility. So I turned over and went  back  to  sleep.
At 7:00 things were looking better with patches of blue beginning to  appear
and by the time I was underway at 8:30 I had good visibility  and  sunshine.
I had brought crampons along thinking that if the night were clear  I  might
need them, but with the cloud cover it hadn\'t even come  close  to  freezing
overnight and the snow remained soft. I easily made my way north  along  the
ridge, then on the west side to the saddle south of Pt 6087. Now  I  had  to
get past the east rocky rib of Pt  6087.   There  were  several  choices  of
moderately steep snow gullies. I chose the least intimidating  looking  even
though this meant climbing higher than necessary. Once across  I  dropped  a
couple hundred feet to traverse below the West  Ridge  of  Damfino  until  I
could climb to the saddle just west of the summit block. On this traverse  I
set off many surface slides of the top several inches of  recent  new  snow.
None were serious enough to worry me but the constant sound of snow  sliding
on snow is not a sound I like to hear.

The actual climb of the summit rock was much  easier  than  I  expected.  It
really was only class 2-3, with maybe one or two class 4 moves for  a  short
person such as myself. I had a rope along but never used it, up or  down.  I
basically just worked my way up the West Ridge,  staying  left  at  a  small
tower half way up - 400 feet of enjoyable scrambling. You  just  never  know
how difficult or easy a climb will  be  until  you  rub  noses  with  it.  I
reached the summit at 10:40 (1.5 miles, 1300 ft 2:10 hrs). I  found  a  film
can register on top but  the  contents  were  dripping  wet  and  completely
illegible. I have said this many times before and  I will say it  again.  If
you are going to go to the trouble  of  placing  a  register  on  a  summit,
please, please, please use waterproof paper! All registers can leak,  either
from faulty design or improper closing.  Once  wet,  if  the  paper  is  not
waterproof it quickly becomes a soggy mess. A register that cannot  be  read
is useless. It goes without saying that I left a  register  with  waterproof
paper.

On the summit the higher peaks were not yet visible, not even  Tomyhoi  just
across Damfino Cr. But the views continued to improve on the  trip  back  to
camp (3 miles, 1850 ft,  4  hrs  RT)  until  even  Baker  and  Shuksan  were
completely out. I had time for a nap in the sun at camp before taking  leave
of this gorgeous area at 2:30. I took a lower route  back  to  Welcome  Pass
reaching it at 4:00. There were no footprints in the snow indicating  anyone
else had been up to the pass. The descent in the forest was still rock  hard
snow and rather treacherous until I hit bare trail. Then easy going  to  the
car at 5:40.

Total for the day: 8 miles, 2200 ft and 7:10 hrs

Grand Total: 18 miles and 7950 ft in 2 days

P.S.  As a minor detail,  Beckey  and  the  GT  Mt  Shuksan  map  gives  the
elevation of Damfino Pk as  6157  ft  but  the  USGS  Mt  Larrabee  map  and
Howbert\'s Master List gives it as 6145 ft.

Packwood Quad - June 20, 2008

Had I know what I was getting myself into on  this  traverse  trip  I  would
have brought more real climbing gear. As it was, all I had with me  was  100
ft of 6mm rope, not really enough to do the job with confidence.  I  suppose
I should have guessed from looking at the  map  that  South  Point  is  very
cliffy and could be a problem,  but  I  was  deceived  by  reading  a  brief
mention of an old trail that continues south along the ridge to  and  beyond
Packwood 1. How difficult could it be if there is a trail?

The trip started well enough up the 3.5 miles trail to the old lookout  site
on South Point. This little used trail begins from an obscure,  but  marked,
TH about 5 miles up Road 20 just west of Packwood. The trail was  in  better
shape than expected and easily followed until I began running into  snow  at
about 4200 ft. I was able to stay with the trail  off  and  on  for  another
1000 ft before losing it completely and just heading  uphill  along  the  NE
Ridge on snow for the final 800 ft to the summit  (3200  ft,  3:40  hrs).  I
spent a pleasant 45 minutes on top in the sun eating  lunch  and  taking  in
the views before trying to  figure  out  how  to  continue  my  traverse  to
Packwood 1.

The trail ascent route up the NE Ridge is easy going but all  other  aspects
of South Point are quite cliffy and most especially the south face which  is
where I wanted to descend. So where the heck did this supposed  continuation
of a trail go? I hadn\'t a clue and I still  don\'t.  I  wandered  around  the
summit area looking for clues and found  none.  Maybe  I  could  have  found
something had there been less snow. The only  thing  I  found  was  a  trail
leading to an outhouse (which surely belongs  on  a  list  of  the  10  most
scenic in the state). A sort of trail continued  down  from  there  but  got
worse and worse until it could no longer really be called a trail.

At this point I seriously considered calling it a day, forgoing  Packwood  1
and just returning the way I had come. I knew I could get myself  into  real
trouble descending unknown technical terrain with only a thin 100  ft  rope.
But the terrain continued down in interesting  scrambleable  rock  and  just
sort of lured me on. I took it  slow,  careful  not  to  make  any  moves  I
couldn\'t reverse. Then I came to some short class 4 moves and made a  couple
easy rappels from trees. I still felt I could climb back  up  if  necessary.
This brought me to the top a narrow  gully  where  I  saw  a  mountain  goat
below. Was this an omen? More importantly was this a  good  omen  or  a  bad
omen? The gully itself looked easy but  I  couldn\'t  see  what  was  at  the
bottom of it without climbing down farther. Sure enough the gully  ended  in
a cliff. This was the point of no return. Once I  rappelled  this  I  didn\'t
think I could get back up. But below the terrain looked much  easier.  So  I
down I went.

Beware of making judgments as to the ease of a descent by  looking  down  on
it. It is frequently harder than it looks. That was the  case  here.  I  was
still a long ways from being down to easy terrain  and  had  to  wander  all
over the face from ledge to ledge to find a scramble  route  down.  I  think
Mr. Billy Goat was laughing at me the whole time although  I  did  find  the
climbing fun and exciting. Even so I breathed a sigh of relief  when  I  hit
continuous snow and could traverse to the ridge connecting  to  Packwood  1.
It had taken me over an hour and a half to find my way down 450 ft of  rock.
The rest of the way to Packwood 1 was easy (4100  ft,  7:20  hrs).   I  even
came across sections of old trail along the partially melted out ridge.

I now had to figure out how to get down to my car. I sure wasn\'t going  back
over South Point. Looking at the  map,  the  most  direct  of  the  feasible
routes appeared to be to descend the slope just north of  the  false  summit
to get into the main drainage west between South Point and Packwood 1.  This
worked reasonably well. After an initial very steep forested cliffy  section
just off the ridgeline, the slope eased. Open forest lasted  to  about  4000
ft where I was funneled into the creek bottom. Brush was  not  bad  but  the
creek had  multiple  waterfalls,  obstacles  and  large  fallen  trees  that
required many detours climbing up and down on the south sidehill.  When  the
creek leveled out I crossed to the north side and followed  pleasant  forest
to hit the road about Â¼ mile from my car.

Total: 7 miles, 4300 ft and 10 hrs.

I had more or less resigned myself to the fact that I would  never  make  it
up this peak. It is much too difficult for me to try on  my  own.  I  needed
the help of climbers stronger and better than I. I did  get  a  shot  at  it
last year when Paul K, Tom S and Mike C invited me to  join  their  attempt.
But conditions were less than ideal and we turned around at the top  of  the
first gully. I figured that was my  one  chance.  I  probably  wouldn\'t  get
another and after that climb I wasn\'t even sure I wanted another  chance.  I
was seriously spooked by that scary monster.  So be it. Life  would  go  on.
Then I got a call out of the blue from Paul to join him and Tom  once  again
on this year\'s attempt. It took me all of two seconds to decide  to  accept.
I got the call on Wednesday evening for  a  Friday-Sunday  climb.  Not  much
time to prepare. But I  had  been  planning  my  own  3-day  trip  Thursday-
Saturday (I almost went Wednesday-Friday in which case I wouldn\'t have  been
home to take the call. Some things are just meant to  be.)  So  I  had  most
things ready to go. I only had  to  add  the  technical  gear.  And  it  was
probably a good thing I had short notice as that allowed for  less  time  to
stress out. As it was, I didn\'t get much sleep that night.

Day 1: Rounding out the party was Sean, a friend of Tom\'s whom I  had  never
met before. We drove up the Middle Fork Nooksack River Road 38 to Road  023.
With the guys cutting out the most  offending  protruding  branches,  I  was
able to coax my Jeep to the end of drivable road at 3700 ft but the last  .5
miles is very overgrown and it is probably best to  park  at  the  preceding
switchback. We started hiking the now abandoned  road  at  11:30,  taking  a
straight line from its end to a  small  lake  at  5100  ft  and  a  pleasant
campsite on the ridge above at 6000 ft (2 miles, 2300 ft, 3 hrs).  This  has
to be one of the easiest approaches to a major peak in all of the  Cascades.
We had a good view of the route  and  could  see  several  possible  problem
areas. The first bergshrund looked challenging and a second  bergshrund  had
opened up at the base of the first gully. We all turned in around 7 pm  with
a planned wakeup call at  2:30  am.  I  tossed  and  turned  at  first  with
disturbing visions  of  ugly  gullies,  horrid  steep  slopes  and  crushing
falling debris dancing in my head. I think  I  finally  dozed  off  sometime
after it got dark around 10:00. It was a warm night and nothing froze.

Day 2: We were climbing by 3:00 am, dropping off the ridge  into  the  basin
below the SW Face. In the basin we stopped to rope up and put  on  crampons,
mine brand new steel ones. The snow was still soft but we figured  we  would
need them at some point.  We climbed 1500 ft up ever steeping  snow  to  the
base of the first bergshrund at which point it was beginning to  get  light.
From here on we protected with running belays. Because of the soft snow  all
pickets were placed as deadmen. The shrund  went  all  the  way  across  the
slope, the only possibility a thin snowbridge on the  right  wall.  Tom  led
across this and up left to where it was necessary to traverse  to  the  base
of the first gully. Here Sean took over  the  lead.  The  second  bergshrund
prevented direct access to the gully forcing Sean onto  dicey  rock  on  the
left to bypass it. My experience climbing rock in  crampons  is  limited.  I
have decided I really don\'t like it but I was glad my crampons  were  steel.
A flat spot on top of the rock provided  a  rare  opportunity  to  rest  and
regroup.

Tom took over the lead again to the top of the first  gully.  Near  the  top
was a short section of water ice where crampons  were  essential  but  above
that was very rotten unstable snow. I was last up the gully and between  the
60 m length of the rope and the curvature of the gully  I  couldn\'t  see  or
hear anything of what was happening above me except that I was in  the  line
of fire of snow debris being kicked down by the lead climbers.  Fortunately,
nothing serious came down but I couldn\'t get out of  there  fast  enough  to
suit me.  When I emerged at the top of the gully, I saw Paul was  leading  a
second traverse to the base of the second gully near  a  leaning  tower.  We
were now above the high point of our  trip  last  year.   The  traverse  led
across to another short rock section then entered the gully by  the  leaning
tower. Paul did his best to hug the right wall and stay out  of  harm\'s  way
in the shade but soon there was no way to avoid the sun and  ever  softening
snow of the upper part. My altimeter was reading 250 feet low so  I  thought
we still had a ways to go when I heard Paul unexpectedly give out a  gleeful
victory yell. The gully led straight to the top and he was  on  the  summit.
After setting up a belay, Paul brought me  up  about  30  minutes  later  at
12:40 (3000 ft, 9:40 hrs), with Tom and Sean joining shortly thereafter.

The summit turned out to be an extremely aerie  perch  of  jumbled  boulders
whose stability was questionable. One false move and you would end  up  over
a thousand feet below on the Thunder Glacier to  the  north  or  the  Deming
Glacier to the east. But  there  was  room  for  all  four  of  us  and  the
panoramic view was out of this world. We had been informed  that  there  was
no register on top so I had brought one of mine in which  Paul  had  entered
the names of all known previous parties. We now joyfully added ours.

We spent over a glorious hour  on  top  before  reality  sank  in  with  the
realization that now we had to get down this monster. What  followed  was  a
blur of 11 rappels. They all kind of ran together so I can\'t vouch  for  the
accuracy of my memory. Rap 1 was off a summit horn into  the  gully.  Rap  2
was another horn. Rap 3 was from a deadman in the middle of gully to a  horn
near the leaning tower. Number 4 was a very awkward  horizontal  semi-rappel
across the traverse to the top  of  the  first  gully.  This  one  seriously
freaked me out. It was in full sun, the snow gave no sense of  security  and
in fact I almost lost it when one of my steps broke  out.  In  addition  Tom
fell into a hidden  hole  many  of  which  were  beginning  to  appear  with
alarming frequency and Sean just missed getting  creamed  by  a  significant
sluff that came from high above. We  all  watched  with  fascination  as  it
bounced and careened down the fall line to disappear into the funnel at  the
bottom.

Raps 5 and 6 were from deadmen down the first gully. This  was  now  in  the
shade but it is a narrow gully and we were all exposed to falling debris  as
we waited for our turns to rappel. Many small sluffs and rocks  were  kicked
off by each of us as we descended but they all stayed in the deep runnel  in
the center and no one was hit. About this time I began having  trouble  with
the weight of the now saturated ropes. I generally like to  rappel  and  get
pleasure in descending down fluidly, but the long ropes were  so  heavy  now
that I had to manually feed them through my belay device which  made  for  a
jerky and awkward movement. I am just too light.

Rap 7 was from a horn on the rock at the base of the first  gully.  Here  we
deviated from our up route and went straight  downhill  to  avoid  the  long
first traverse and the first bergshrund. We had  gone  this  way  last  year
with the final rap being vertical to free over  an  ice  cliff.  Somehow  it
escaped us that on this warn sunny day with the mountain melting before  our
very eyes it would no longer be ice. 3 more deadmen raps brought us  to  the
edge of the cliff. Sure enough we could hear  water  roaring  below  us  but
none of us knew what was really down there. It turned out  much  worse  than
any of us expected. Sean volunteered to be first down as he had for much  of
the descent. Oh to be young and fearless.   Over  he  went.  20  minutes  of
uncertainty went by during which we heard nothing  above  the  roar  of  the
water. Did he drown? Did he fall in  a  hole?  Actually  the  poor  guy  was
untangling the rope while being drenched with water but we didn\'t know  that
at the time. When he finally did yell "off rappel", we all breathed  a  sigh
of relief. At least it was possible to get down. Tom went next. Then it  was
my turn.  I stepped over the edge.  The  first  thing  I  saw  was  an  ugly
bottomless black hole below me into  which  a  rather  large  waterfall  was
pouring. Then I saw the waterfall which could not be  avoided.  Then  I  saw
Tom yelling at me frantically but I couldn\'t hear above the  roar.  What  he
was yelling was to go fast. Problem was I couldn\'t. The rope  was  right  in
the waterfall and even heavier now than before. If I completely  let  go  of
the rope, I would just hang in space. I  had  to  painfully  feed  the  rope
through and inch down with water washing  over  me  from  chest  down.  Then
there was the challenge of not  ending  up  in  the  black  hole.  One  more
obstacle of a gaping moat below that and I was home free. I felt like I  had
been delivered from the jaws of a whale. That was one scary  evil  waterfall
gully.

It was now about 9:30 and almost dark. Sean was already out of sight  making
a beeline back to camp and dry clothes. It was a matter of survival.  I  was
also drenched and freezing cold, my feet blocks of ice, and Tom told  me  to
do the same. I felt bad about leaving the ropes to him and  Paul  but  again
it was a matter of survival. Tom with his extra weight had been almost  able
to free fall through the waterfall and didn\'t get soaked. I reached camp  at
10:40 warmed slightly by the movement (3100  ft,  19:40  hrs).   I  had  dry
socks and upper clothes but nothing except rain pants for  the  lower  half.
It would have to do. Fortunately, the night was warm, though windy.

Day 3: I slept like a rock until being awakened by a horrible  squawking  at
first light. I thought it was a crow until I looked out the  tent  door  and
saw a very vocal ptarmigan perched on a rock not 5 feet away. I  don\'t  know
what her problem was. I went back to sleep until awakened again  by  sun  on
the tent at 8:00. We had a leisurely breakfast, all of us  gazing  at  where
we had been the day before  and  each  of  us  thankful  that  we  had  been
delivered safely from evil and never had to return again.  Between  the  sun
and the warm wind most of my clothes dried by the time we left at 10:30.  We
were back to the car an hour and a half later.

I still can\'t believe I climbed Lincoln. Of course I couldn\'t  have  without
the help of three great guys. I will be eternally grateful to them  all  for
making such a special experience possible, especially Paul.  And  after  all
my stressing and worrying, I was  actually  surprised  that  I  enjoyed  the
climbing as much as I did. The only things that really freaked me  out  were
the horizontal rappel from the second to the first gully and  the  waterfall
rappel. But the climbing on Lincoln is not so much a physical  challenge  as
it is a mental one. It is just so relentless,  constantly  steep  with  very
few resting places and continually exposed to  falling  debris.  It  is  one
scary mountain.

Total: 6 miles and 5500 ft in 3 days

Liberty Cap (14,112 ft - 472P - Mt Rainier West Quad) - July 8-10, 2008

I didn\'t want to have to climb Mt Rainier again,  I  really  didn\'t.   Don\'t
get me wrong. I love Mt Rainier and  think  it  a  beautiful  mountain,  but
after 3 times up it (and two other  failed  attempts  fairly  high)  I  just
thought I was done with it and would ever after appreciate its  beauty  from
afar. It is a lot of work to climb Mt Rainier and on each previous  climb  I
got a mild but still unpleasant case of altitude  sickness  which  wasn\'t  a
whole lot of fun. Of course, strictly  speaking,  Liberty  Cap  is  not  the
actual summit of Mt Rainier, Columbia Crest is. But they are so close  there
is essentially no difference in the effort required. So I repeat,  I  really
didn\'t want to climb Mt Rainier again. Then, after  I  finished  the  Bulger
100 Highest list, John Roper put the idea in my head  to  do  the  REAL  100
Highest Peaks in Washington - that is only those that have a clean 400  feet
of prominence, no other criteria or  finagling.  Never  one  to  pass  up  a
challenge, I looked at the difference between the two lists  to  see  if  it
were possible for me to do.  Only two seemed a  problem.  Lincoln  I  didn\'t
think I was capable of doing and Liberty Cap I didn\'t  want  to  do.   So  I
left those for last. When I actually ended up climbing  Lincoln,  that  then
meant I simply HAD to climb Liberty Cap.

Day 1: I enlisted the aid of my friend Linda and we decided to approach  via
Glacier Basin, Camp Schurman and the Emmons Glacier. Linda has a cabin  near
Crystal Mtn, worked on the Ski Patrol there and knows  just  about  everyone
in that area, including the climbing ranger Sam at Camp Schurman. The  first
part of the trail to Glacier Basin was obliterated in the  2006  floods  and
is still very rough, but once past that it was easy going the  rest  of  the
way. The Inter Glacier was mostly crevasse free and smooth but we  made  the
mistake of staying unroped when  dropping  off  Steamboat  Prow  on  to  the
Emmons. Not a good idea as several potentially large and deep crevasses  had
to be crossed. We reached Camp Schurman at 4:00 (5350 ft,  7  hrs).  It  was
quite windy that night.

Day 2: We started next morning at 3:30, joined by Dan  who  is  the  Sunrise
Ranger. This was his first year in the park and he had not yet  climbed  the
mountain. He had hoped to climb with Sam, but Sam had already  been  up  the
day before and was going the next day with his girlfriend. So Dan  asked  if
he could join Linda and me. We pointed out we were going to Liberty Cap  and
not Columbia Crest but he felt he could safely solo from where   the  routes
diverge at the saddle between the two. So we readily agreed thinking   three
on a rope was safer than  two.  He  turned  out  to  be  a  very  compatible
ropemate.

The climb was every bit as much work as I had remembered but at  least  this
time I didn\'t get altitude sickness, a real plus. However, I  had  forgotten
how huge and  beautiful  the  Emmons  Glacier  is.  And  the  crevasses  are
massive. The route itself is rather intricate,  though  easily  followed  as
hordes of climbers have been on it, and wanders here and there as it  weaves
around countless crevasses and seracs. One particularly interesting  section
was dubbed the Maze by Dan. At around 13,500  ft  the  route  makes  a  long
traverse to the Liberty Cap saddle  to  avoid  the  bergshrund  that  always
forms on the upper Emmons. Here we left Dan to his own devises at  8:30  and
continued on to Liberty Cap, reaching that important summit  at  9:30  (4750
ft, 6 hrs). The upper part of the mountain was  very  windy.  Several  gusts
blew me off balance, so we didn\'t tarry long. For those who may soon  follow
I left a register in a hole in the snow but I have no idea how long it  will
remain there.

We were back to the saddle at 10:30 and picked up Dan again  who  timed  the
meeting just right as he could see our progress  from  far  off.   The  snow
began to soften on the way down making the last bit to Camp Schurman a  real
chore. An earlier start  probably  would  have  been  better.   Although  we
reached camp at 1:30 (10 hrs RT) and had the time, both  Linda  and  I  were
too tired to continue out.  After a rest, I took a short hike to the top  of
Steamboat Prow via the class 3 trail right behind the Ranger cabin. Then  it
was dinner and to bed at 7:00.  It was  even  windier  this  night.  Several
times I thought our tent was going to take flight.

Day 3: We awoke at 6:00, after 11 hours of sleep,  only  slightly  disturbed
by the new batch of climbers getting ready for their climbs.  It  was  still
very windy and several parties had  already  turned  around  because  of  it
before we left at 7:30. To avoid roping up for the glacier we went out  over
the trail up Steamboat Prow. We then followed the ridge to  its  low  point.
Linda found a sheltered spot to wait while I made a 30 minute sprint  up  Mt
Ruth. This involved one class 4  move  and  almost  getting  blown  off  the
ridge. We had a great glissade down the Inter Glacier before the final  trek
through welcome green, after the stark world of snow and ice above,  Glacier
Basin to the car (1000 ft, 5 hrs).

Total: 11,100 ft in 3 days.

Chimney Rock (7727 ft - 2727P or 7680+ ft according to Beckey) - July 23-
25, 2008

Beth and I had been hoping to do this peak for some  time  but  neither  our
schedules nor the weather  ever  seemed  to  co-operate.   With  her  recent
retirement and resulting greater flexibility things finally came together.

Day 1:  We  started  from  the  Pete  Lake  TH  at  Cooper  Lake  and  hiked
approximately 7 miles to the  first  switchback  on  the  PCT  opposite  the
waterfalls draining the Chimney Glacier (1000 ft, 3:45 hr). We  had  trouble
locating any discernable climber\'s trail  and  ended  up  just  bushwhacking
down to Chimney Cr and then wasting a good hour finding  a  way  across.  We
really wanted to get into the woods to the  right  of  the  broad  avalanche
slope below the waterfalls but the only good log jam crossed below  and  led
to more brush. We eventually worked our way  into  the  woods  and  stumbled
across the climber\'s trail but this trail appears little used  and  is  hard
to follow. We wasted another hour after losing the trail in  a  cliffy  area
and getting too high. At this critical point the trail dropped a  bit  below
the cliffs and crossed a minor gully into woods where the trail became  more
obvious. It then climbed very steeply at the  base  of  the  cliffs  through
ferns and vegetated talus,  crossed  a  small  creek  and  turned  right  up
extremely steep forest until it could traverse left  above  a  deep  ravine.
Sparse flagging helped out now and then to stay on route. We soon came to  a
creek and small level bench at 4750 ft that made for an  ideal  campsite  (8
miles, 2700 ft, 7:45 hr).

Day 2: Starting at 6:30, we quickly gained the  barren  moraine  above  camp
and had our first look at the mountain. We had  several  choices  of  route.
The glacier itself looked in good shape but the snow finger leading to  both
the East Face routes looked broken up and it  was  questionable  whether  we
could easily get up it. The snow gully to  the  U-Gap  looked  passable.  We
both wanted as little roped climbing as  possible  and  since  the  traverse
from the U-Gap was supposed to be the easiest way to the base of the  summit
rock, we decided on that route.

We descended 100 feet off the moraine onto the  lower  glacier  heading  for
the rock cliff left of the icefall. A gully dissecting this cliff up and  to
the right is supposed to give the  easiest  access  to  the  upper  glacier.
Well, it isn\'t all that easy. Just getting into the gully involved  climbing
some of the worse loose rock covered steep hard dirt crude I have ever  been
on. It was truly horrid and took much longer  than  anticipated.  The  gully
itself wasn\'t much better. More loose rock and wet class 3-4 junk. Beth  and
I found separate ways up so we wouldn\'t kill each  other  with  rockfall.  I
stayed in the gully while she worked onto the left wall. We  met  higher  up
for a last easier bit to the upper glacier.

Once on the upper glacier easy terrain led into the wide gully below the  U-
Gap. But even here we ran into unexpected  difficulties.  What  appeared  as
smooth continuous snow from below actually contained a series  of  crevasses
many of which almost completely crossed the slope. The  snow  also  suddenly
turned icy. We had to don crampons and   zigzag  our  way  through  or  step
across the smaller ones. Fortunately the  snow  edges  were  solid  and  the
cracks themselves not that deep  or  scary.  Near  the  top  though  was  an
impasse that forced us off the snow onto rock  on  the  right  a  couple  of
hundred feet below the gap.

We were following the route description in Beckey that states you leave  the
snow gully just below the U-Gap on a large bench to  begin  the  traverse  N
below the S Peak. Only problem was there was no bench visible, only a  sheer
cliff, and we ended up going all the way to the U-Gap. We had  assumed  that
Beckey meant you leave the gully just before getting to the U-Gap.  What  he
really meant was you go all the way to the U-Gap, cross over  to  the  other
side and just below, on the OTHER side, you find the bench.  We  had  a  few
anxious moments of thinking we were way off  route  until  we  figured  this
out.

There was indeed a broad bench, but with a short tricky  slabby  section  to
access it, that went up and around to the east side of the South  Peak.  But
once again there was a little confusion of  where  to  go  from  there.  The
bench itself slanted down to end at a  precipice  and  went  nowhere.  There
were two other possibilities.  Beth explored  a  likely  looking  ramp  that
went up left while I checked out a  more  unlikely  looking  narrow  exposed
ledge that went straight ahead into what looked  like  space.  Beth\'s  route
led to 5th class climbing but mine miraculously went around the  corner  and
opened up into a wide continuous heather ledge that traversed  all  the  way
across the face  to connect with the East Face  route  300  feet  below  the
South Peak-Main Peak notch. I had always thought that this traverse  was  on
a series of disjointed loose rock wildly exposed ledges, but in  reality  it
turned out to be a very  enjoyable  single  continuous  heather  ledge  wide
enough, for the most part, that the feeling of exposure was  minimized.  One
of  the  most  pleasant  surprises  I  have  encountered  in   my   climbing
experience.

The ledge soon turned a corner to a spectacular view of  the  summit  tower.
It looked positively frightful and completely unclimbable. However  were  we
going to get up that thing? We could see the notorious "Key  Ledge"  though.
It must lead to the route out of sight  on  the  other  side.  We  descended
slightly off our heather ledge to a series of lovely solid white rock  steps
which connected to the East Face route and worked our way up  this  pleasant
class 3-4 section to just below the notch. Here we traversed  right  passing
beneath a tower to the so called "Blind Chimney," descended to the top of  a
loose gully, crossed and went up an easy ramp on the other side to  the  Key
Ledge.

We had scrambled the entire route to this point. It was now time to get  out
the rope. Pitch 1 started directly from the Key Ledge.  It  was  a  60  foot
vegetated steep chimney that turned out to be much  harder  than  it  looked
with awkward off balance moves and sparse holds. I  thrashed  and  contorted
my way  desperately  upward  using  all  of  my  limited  arm  strength  and
collapsed with a sigh of relief at the top totally done in.  After  a  short
easy heathery section right, I gratefully turned over the lead to  Beth  for
pitch 2 up a slabby face to a wide bench with multiple  rappel  anchors.  By
the end of that pitch I had  recovered  sufficiently  to  take  on  pitch  3
around the corner to the right,  a  deep  chimney  which  was  a  full  rope
length. The first part was easy then it increased in difficulty as I  exited
left out of the chimney proper onto the face. The pitch ended at  the  ridge
only a few feet from the summit (3370 ft, 10:30 hrs).

It was now almost 5:00, but despite the lateness of the hour, worries  about
getting down and thoughts of an impending bivy, we took  a  few  moments  to
enjoy the spectacular views and our long coveted aerie perch.  We  did  find
a register but it was irretrievable at the bottom of a 10 foot crack,  so  I
placed a new one of mine. I was disappointed we couldn\'t see when  the  last
ascent was.

Two rappels got us down the chimney, and two more back  to  the  key  ledge,
then it was all downclimbing, slowly and carefully retracing our  up  route.
We reached the U-Gap at 8:45, put on crampons and had just enough  light  to
thread our way down the crevasse maze. At the top of the gully to the  lower
glacier we finally had to get out headlamps.  On  the  steepest  section  we
came upon a rappel anchor that Beth had noticed on the way up.  This  was  a
most interesting anchor consisting of two tricams and  a  nut  in  the  same
crack all equalized with a long sling and attached to a full  climbing  rope
with a locking biner. One wonders what the story was  behind  this  and  how
desperate  the  party  was  to  have  abandoned  all  this  expensive  gear.
Unfortunately, the rope had been there long enough to show serious signs  of
wear and we could not trust it. The anchor looked okay, though, and  we  did
use it with our rope for one last slightly wet rappel into the  gully.  Then
it was down the awful loose crud to the snow  below.  This  seemed  to  take
forever. But once on the lower glacier we knew we  could  make  it  back  to
camp and would not have to bivy, although it took until 1:30 am and  we  did
need the GPS to help us find it. Yes, indeed, unlike on Forbidden this  time
I did remember to mark camp (3 miles, 3700 ft, 19 hrs).

Day 3: We slept in until 9:00 when the heat of the sun on  the  tent  forced
us to get up and left at 11:00 after a leisurely breakfast.  We  had  to  be
careful to stay on route descending the climber\'s trail. It is not all  that
well used or obvious in many spots. Once again my GPS helped in this  regard
as I had the upward track for guidance. We reached  the  creek  crossing  at
1:00 and Pete Lake at 2:45 where we had a long lunch and Beth took a dip  to
cool off.  A cool breeze here made the rest pleasant but  the  rest  of  the
way back to car we were plagued  by  hordes  of  maddening  mosquitoes.  The
welcome sight of the car came at 5:40, not a moment too soon for this  tired
body (8 miles, 600 ft, 6:40 hrs).

Total: 19 miles and 7000 ft in 3 days.

Additional Notes:

Gear: 50 m 8.2mm rope, full set of Alien cams, set of small  nuts,  a  dozen
or so carabineers and slings, hard hat, crampons  and  ice  axe.  Beth  took
rock shoes. I did not.

From the look of the climber\'s trail and the  old  tattered  rappel  slings,
this peak doesn\'t appear to be climbed all that often, which  surprised  me.
I thought it saw more traffic. But we found no new slings and no signs of  a
recent ascent other  than  a  few  possible  footprints  lower  down.  Maybe
everyone just uses the old slings.

Our times surely do not set any speed records. You might even say  they  are
downright slow, but we took our time to be careful and did make  it  up  and
down safely. And I don\'t think that is too bad for two 60+ older ladies.

Day 1 (Thursday) - Swamp Cr Camp: Stefan, Mike Torok,  Erin  Reading  and  I
left from my house at 5:30  to  catch  the  9:20  Lady  Express  at  Field\'s
Landing to Stehekin. They now have a fuel and excess  baggage  surcharge.  I
think you are allowed 75# total with each individual  item  less  than  55#,
but it was somewhat confusing and not well posted. In any event  they  tried
to rip off Stefan for some $12 more since his pack weighed 70#  but  somehow
he talked them out of it. It seems that with the high  cost  of  fuel  these
days all modes of transportation are looking  for  more  revenue.  This  did
not, however, apply to the bus shuttle to High  Bridge  which  is  still  $5
each way for the 11 mile trip, a real bargain. It was 12:30 by the  time  we
started up the Agnes Cr trail in stifling heat. I  do  not  normally  go  on
this long a trip and the unusually heavy weight of my pack  took  its  toll.
Fortunately the trail was  good  and  the  distance  not  that  far  to  our
comfortable camp at Swamp Cr (8.6 miles,  1700  ft,  4:30  hrs).  There  was
thunder and lightning with light rain during the night.

Day 2 (Friday) - Lyall Ridge: The original plan was  to  climb  Agnes  first
with bonus peaks added later as time  allowed,  but  unsettled  weather  and
thundershowers were predicted through Saturday, so  we  decided  to  reverse
things and climb Lyall Ridge  first.  This  turned  out  to  be  a  straight
forward trek up mostly pleasant terrain to the north  ridge  with  class  3+
scrambling the rest of the way to the summit (4900 ft, 4:45 hrs).  We  could
see a few spot fires (one on Needle Pk) started by last  night\'s  lightening
and a helicopter circling the area checking them out. The  day  had  started
mostly sunny but by the time we reached  the  top  at  1:20,  we  could  see
thunderclouds forming and when we left  an  hour  later  they  were  looking
downright ominous. We made it off the rock and about half  way  down  before
the storm hit. And I do mean hard. The first  wave  of  rain  came  down  in
buckets, so hard we sought shelter under a tree to wait  out  the  worst  of
it. We thought we had and started down again. Then a second wave hit and  it
rained even harder and added marble sized hail to the mix. Again  we  sought
shelter under a tree but it was hopeless. We were all soaked  and  cold  and
getting colder. It let up slightly only to have a third wave hit just as  we
dragged into camp looking and feeling like drowned  rats  (4.8  miles,  5300
ft, 8:45 hrs). Much of the ground was white with hail or flooded  with  deep
puddles. Swamp Creek was already running muddy brown.

Stefan, bless him, had thought to bring a large tarp which  he  had  erected
the night before over a fire pit. Now Mike, bless him also,  got  a  roaring
fire going. Once under the tarp in front of a warm fire things  didn\'t  look
quite so bleak and we spent the rest of the evening warming  up  and  drying
out.

Day 3 (Saturday) - Swamp Cr Camp: After our experience the  day  before  and
with the threat of more thundershowers, no one was  anxious  to  move  to  a
high camp. We did not want to be up high in such conditions. We even  passed
on a day climb of Needle Pk, putting all our hopes on improving weather  the
next day. But we were running out of time to climb Agnes. Actually  the  day
turned out to not be that bad, and we wondered if  we  had  made  the  right
decision to stay put. However, it was clear the weather was  still  unstable
and in fact it did rain again lightly in the  evening  and  the  high  peaks
stayed in fog. We kept a fire going all day enjoying  each  other\'s  company
and almost drying out our boots.

Day 4 (Sunday) - Mt Asa and High Camp:  This day dawned  cloudy  and  foggy.
With much trepidation and uncertainty, we decided to try for Agnes.  It  was
now or never.  Mostly  we  were  banking  on  the  long  range  forecast  of
improving weather that we had gotten before the start of  the  trip  but  we
had no idea if it was still valid. We left my tent and the tarp  up,  sorted
out any unneeded gear and hung extra food to lighten our  load  as  much  as
possible and started at 8:40. We followed the trail about a mile farther  to
near the confluence of Agnes and Spruce Creeks, crossed Agnes Cr on  a  log,
went upstream along Spruce Cr a short ways then headed uphill on a  timbered
rib. The going was actually quite good with very little brush. We  had  some
sun and some sprinkles on the way up and it was never certain which way  the
weather would go. About 1000 feet below the ridge we began traversing  right
to hit the 6800 ft saddle just SW of Asa, dumped our packs and followed  the
easy ridge to that summit (4300 ft, 5:30 hrs).

Mt Asa has little prominence but is a very historic summit. It was the  site
of a 1908 survey by Asa  Post  and  party  and  still  boasts  the  original
register. I have never before climbed any peak  with  a  register  over  100
years old. Adding even more interest was the second  ascent  by  Asa\'s  well
known son Austin Post  39  years  later.  After  reaching  this  summit  and
reading the historic register we all felt our trip was already a success.

The next hour was a race to beat the weather that we could  see  approaching
to our campsite. This we found in a delightful 7000 foot  meadow  saddle  SE
of Pt 7458 (4 miles, 4750 ft, 6:30 hr). We even had  running  water  from  a
snow patch a short ways downhill. I just managed to get my bivy tent up  and
all my gear stowed when it began to  rain.  But  it  wasn\'t  very  hard  and
didn\'t last long. We were able to have a  pleasant  dinner  outside  in  the
open.

Day 5 (Monday) - Agnes Mtn: It froze during the night and by morning  I  was
cold in my light sleeping bag, but that meant the  sky  was  clear  and  the
weather had finally turned for the better. We had a perfect summit  day.  We
were on our way by 6:00. Or rather I was on my way at 6:00. Stefan had  left
maybe 15 minutes earlier. He is the only person I know who can literally  be
ready 5 minutes after rolling out of his sleeping bag. This morning he  took
a little longer while he fired up the stove as a concession to those  of  us
who wanted something hot for breakfast. Anyone who  has  ever  climbed  with
Stefan also knows that normal people cannot keep  up  with  him.  Well  Erin
qualifies as not normal. This energetic woman is unreal. Not  only  can  she
keep up with Stefan, I think she could pass him. But then  she  is  only  25
years old. She left after me, blew past me and quickly  caught  up  to  him.
Between Stefan and Erin, poor Mike and I were  constantly  driven  close  to
exhaustion working at maximum capacity just to keep up. And I  must  mention
that Erin\'s choice of footwear is light low-cut tennies.  That  is  all  she
ever wears. She even straps on crampons when needed. No amount of  reasoning
can get her to acknowledge the advantage of  boots.  Of  course  you  cannot
argue with success. She does just  fine  and  certainly  can  climb  circles
around me. She did take rock shoes for the rock pitches though.

From camp we headed for Pt 7458 but got too high.  It  is  best  to  contour
this point via ledges on the left to the 7200 ft  (first)  notch  before  Pt
7760. We made another mistake  by  staying  on  the  ridge  here  and  doing
several roped pitches thinking we were climbing Pt 7760 only to discover  we
were on a sub point and had to do  a  short  rappel  to  get  off  it.  This
consumed a couple of hours and we weren\'t even past  Pt  7760  and  its  5.4
pitch yet. Fortunately Mike spied the slab bypass, which he  led,  mentioned
by Tom and Dan Sjolseth in their TR of last year that avoided that pitch.

On the ridge again easy terrain led to the final  notch  before  the  summit
tower of Agnes. We donned crampons to cross the snow patch and then  entered
a very loose gully up and to the  left.  After  several  hundred  feet,  the
gully came to a headwall just below the ridge and  we  scrambled  right.  We
passed a deep chimney with a chockstone and just beyond  that  was  the  5.6
crux pitch. Stefan led this difficult pitch then brought the rest of us  up.
At the top were rappel slings so we knew we were on route. Above  this  Mike
led another short slabby pitch to the last easy but loose  scramble  to  the
summit at 1:00 (1800 ft, 7 hrs). A large mountaineer register  indicated  we
were the 25th party to summit.

We did not tarry long as we had to get all the way  back  to  our  Swamp  Cr
camp before day\'s end. Two rappels  got  us  to  the  gully  which  we  then
downclimbed slowly  and  carefully  staying  close  together.  Rockfall  was
abundant. At the (final) notch Stefan came up with the idea to descend  1200
ft into the Yew Cr valley, traverse well below Pt 7760 and climb back up  to
the first notch and thus avoid the entire rocky ridge.  The  first  part  of
the descent gully was horrible loose rock and slick dirt and we all  thought
maybe this idea was  a  mistake.  Lower  we  were  able  to  get  onto  snow
(crampons needed) and with Mike making steps down things  got  easier.  Then
it was easy traversing on talus and softer snow to the  first  notch.  Notch
to notch took 2 hours which we all agreed  was  faster  than  reversing  the
ridge route. We were back to high  camp  by  5:15,  quickly  packed  up  and
dropped directly down on a left traverse until we intersected our up  route.
 We reached the log crossing in growing darkness and made our Swamp Cr  camp
at 9:30 (6 miles, 3100 ft, 11:15 hrs). We took time for a hot dinner  before
turning in, tired but happy climbers.

Day 6 (Tuesday) - Heading Home: We were up at  6:00  and  left  at  7:30  in
order to make the 12:15 shuttle at High Bridge.  We  all  went  at  our  own
pace. Erin made it first, followed by Stefan, then Mike. I  brought  up  the
rear but still got to High Bridge in plenty  of  time  to  wash  up  in  the
Stehekin River and put on the clean clothes I had stashed there (8.6  miles,
650 ft, 3:40 hrs). We had a little time to kill in Stehekin before the  2:15
boat so we checked out the visitor center and listened to a  short  talk  on
the disadvantages of constant fire  suppression  given  by  an  enthusiastic
young Park Ranger. I slept almost the  entire  boat  ride  back  to  Field\'s
Point. We reached my home, after a stop for dinner, at 9:30. Yes indeed,  it
takes a long time to travel to the Stehekin area.

Grand Total: 32 miles and 15,500 ft in 6 days.

I was somewhat worried about doing this  group  of  peaks  so  late  in  the
season, afraid I would run into horrible brush on the approach and  lack  of
water for camping on the  ridge.  I  also  wanted  longer  daylight.  I  had
actually planned on doing this trip back in June when  such  concerns  would
not be an issue, but the night before I was all set to go I got a call  from
Paul Klenke inviting me on Lincoln. Guess which peak took precedence!

Day 1(Friday): Mebee and Tarheel - I essentially  followed  the  route  that
Mike T and Matt B did in early June  of  last  year,  except  that  they  of
course had much more snow  which  would  have  made  much  of  the  approach
easier. I parked at the turnout just past County Line Cr (elev 2700 ft)  and
followed the ridge just to the left. It began well enough  in  an  old  burn
and open forest but soon deteriorated to moderate brush.  It  wasn\'t  really
horrible, just enough to be annoying, slow  me  down  and  prevent  me  from
wearing shorts. Somewhere around 5000 ft I broke out into open  meadows  and
the going became much more pleasant with views expanding at  every  step.  I
reached the summit of Mebee BM at  3:45  (3  miles,  3750  ft,  4  hrs)  and
reveled in my spectacular surroundings.

From Mebee I dropped down the left side past cliffs to 6200 ft and  followed
the lovely meadowed ridge over Pt 6740 to a  gorgeous  campsite,  elev  6680
ft, at 5:00 (4.25 miles, 4300 ft, 5:15 hr).  I had a view  of  Ragged  Ridge
out my front door and a view of Crater and Jack out my back door. What  more
could I ask for? Well, water somewhere nearby  would  have  been  nice.   My
fears of the ridge being dry materialized. I could see  small  snow  patches
on the ridge and in the  basin  below  Tarheel,  but  on  closer  inspection
neither produced running water. As a last resort there was a  5919  ft  lake
far below but I so didn\'t want to descend 800 ft. Melting snow was  my  only
other option. Such are the hazards of ridge camping late in the season.

After setting up camp, I wandered  the  short  distance  up  Tarheel.  After
climbing the main summit, I also went up the NE peak which turned out to  be
a fun little class 3-4 scramble. On the way back  to  camp  I  filled  up  a
large bag with snow to melt for dinner (1.25 miles, 800 ft. 2 hrs).

Day 2(Saturday): Joseph Pk, Elija Ridge and  Gabriel  -  I  began  the  next
morning at 7:15, not as early as I  would  have  liked,  but  the  days  are
already getting noticeably shorter and it doesn\'t  get  light  until  around
6:00 now. After being out recently  on  Agnes  with  super  guy  and  wonder
woman, it was a real pleasure to go at my own pace. It was also a  necessity
as I was still recovering from a virus I most likely picked up on  the  boat
ride back from Stehekin  and  I  was  feeling  a  bit  slow  and  lethargic.
However, the lovely terrain invigorated me and gave me  energy  as  I  began
the long traverse toward Elija Ridge. This entailed dropping to the 6320  ft
saddle between Elija and  Tarheel,  traversing  seemingly  endless  somewhat
unpleasant scree and talus to Joseph, dropping again to the 7120 ft  Joseph-
Elija saddle before the final climb to the high  point  of  Elija  Ridge  (3
miles, 1900 ft, 3 hrs).  I had been warned there  was  no  register  so  had
brought one of mine.

Although I had already  climbed  Joseph  on  the  way  to  Elija,  I  wasn\'t
positive where the actual summit was and since  it  appeared  easier  to  go
back over the top rather than traverse  some  very  unpleasant  sidehill,  I
reclimbed to that summit (2300 ft, 5 hrs). This is when I  came  across  the
register placed by Stefan on 5/19/02. (I am not sure how  I  missed  it  the
first time around.)  Stefan  had  named  this  peak  Joseph  at  that  time,
although I believe JR calls it Ezekiel. The register  was  soaking  wet  and
partially illegible. I spent the better part of 20  minutes  drying  it  out
and transcribing the entries onto WATERPROOF paper.  Included were:

    7/4/04 - Don and Natala Goodman  on  a  traverse  of  Elija  Ridge  from
Panther to Cabinet Creeks

    8/6/05 - Paul Klenke and Mike Collins

    6/2/07 - Mike Torok, Matt Burton, Eric Johnson, Billie  Butterfield  and
Erin Reading

    6/2/08??? -my best guess, hard to read - Dave Creeden

I was surprised there was a register on this minor peak and  none  on  Elija
Ridge. I realize Elija could  have  originally  fallen  victim  to  "He  Who
Removes All Registers From The North Cascades National Park",  but  come  on
guys, one of you could have replaced it since. I  always  feel  disappointed
when I am denied the chance to read  the  previous  climbing  history  of  a
major peak.

Gabriel was next on the agenda. I had a good view earlier of  the  basin  to
the NE and the three possible gullies leading to the SE ridge  mentioned  by
Mike in his TR. None contained any significant snow. I had  brought  ice  ax
and crampons along but seeing no snow had left them both in camp. To get  to
the basin I first had to descend some  1800  ft  to  the  5700  ft  Gabriel-
Cabinet Cr saddle. I was afraid I would run into brush in the  creek  bottom
but was pleasantly surprised to find it very easy travel through open  woods
and marshy meadows. Here I ran into my first running water of the  trip  and
stopped to soak my poor aching  feet  and  augment  my  water  supply.  Good
travel continued up alongside a gushing creek into the beautiful  NE  basin.
Then it all went to heck. With no snow all the gullies looked unpleasant  so
I took the most direct first one on the right. Bad choice.  The  upper  part
was gosh awful hard dirt and slabby rock that I barely managed  to  claw  my
way up. No way was I coming down that.

At the top of the gully I was confronted with  more  unpleasant  terrain,  a
series of ribs and gullies to cross over class  2-3+  terrain.  I  took  the
traverse quite high. At times it looked as if I would  be  cliffed  out  but
when needed a ledge always appeared that went.   After  taking  much  longer
(or was I just  getting  tired  and  footsore?)  than  anticipated  for  the
distance, I topped out on Gabriel\'s summit at 5:00 (7 miles, 4700  ft,  9:45
hrs). Again I left a register as there was none. I retraced my route,  which
was intricate in spots, to my up notch but continued traversing to the  next
notch to the SE along the ridge. After a short step off the ridge  this  led
to an easy gully (I believe this is the one Mike and Matt  took)  with  fast
scree plunge stepping. In no time at all I was down to the  5700  ft  saddle
and creek. I again soaked my even more aching feet  and  filled  up  with  Â½
gallon of water for dinner. It was then a slow tired grind  uphill  to  camp
where I arrived at 8:15 in dimming light (10 miles, 5700 ft, 13 hrs).

Day 3(Sunday): Beebe Mtn - The weather  forecast  was  for  rain  coming  in
sometime during the day. Exactly when was  uncertain.  My  plan  was  if  it
looked bad in the morning I would just head out,  otherwise  I  would  climb
Beebe. A strong wind came in during the night  signaling  a  change  in  the
weather but rain held off, so at 7:00 I headed for Beebe.  First  I  had  to
get past the annoying rocky bump of Pt 7026. This I did by  going  over  the
top. At times it looked like I would get cliffed out on the descent  to  the
Beebe saddle, but by going to the left there was a way down.  From  then  on
it was a most enjoyable ridge ramble to the  summit  of  Beebe  (2.5  miles,
1300 ft, 2 hrs).  On the way back I contoured around the  left  side  of  Pt
7026 on an interesting ledge into the basin N of Tarheel  and  regained  the
ridge up easy scree. This was easier than going over the top again.

I was back in camp at 11:00 (5 miles, 2000 ft, 4 hrs)  and  after  taking  a
short rest, packed up and left  at  12:30.  I  could  see  the  weather  was
deteriorating. In fact it was beginning to sprinkle lightly. I did not  want
to return over Mebee. Instead I went down a spur arm ridge off Pt 6740  that
led to County Line Creek. I was afraid this route might  be  brushy  but  it
wasn\'t too bad, certainly better than Meebe\'s ridge. When I came  to  County
Line Creek at 4000 ft, I crossed it and then traversed to my up route  below
all the brush. I reached the car at  3:30  just  as  it  began  to  rain  in
earnest (3 miles, 100 ft, 3 hrs).

Total: 23.5 miles and 12,900 ft in 3 days

Mt Arriva (8215 ft - 1215P) and Fisher Pk (8040+ ft  -  720P)  -  Mt  Arriva
Quad - August 29-31, 2008

I joined Jim, Eileen, Kevin, Beth and Don  for  this  trip  into  the  North
Cascades National Park. Given the steadily  deteriorating  weather  forecast
before we left, I put our chance of success  during  the  3-day  time  frame
allotted at close to zero. So convinced was I of this  that  I  allowed  for
another day to increase my chances or perhaps do other peaks  in  the  area.
What I didn\'t take into consideration  was  the  lucky  "honeymoon  effect".
Jim and Eileen had just been married the week before.

Day 1 (Friday) - We all met at the Easy Pass TH at  10:30,  hiked  the  easy
3.5 miles to the pass and descended 2 miles down the other side into  Fisher
Cr. We were all delighted that the weather  was  holding  and  we  even  had
passable views. At the stake pointing to Fisher Cr camp  we  came  across  a
volunteer Park Ranger.  Good  thing  I  had  stopped  to  get  a  permit  in
Marblemount. I had a feeling this popular trail  would  be  patrolled  on  a
holiday weekend.

From the stake we followed a way trail into  beautiful  Fisher  Creek  Basin
until it was obliterated by a  massive  avalanche  that  had  come  off  the
cliffs of Arches and swept up the opposite side of the valley.   We  crossed
the creek and continued up the open valley to the base  of  the  gully  that
leads to Silent Lakes. Jim calls this Silent Gully but it  is  a  bit  of  a
misnomer as it was anything but silent as the six of us made our way up  the
horrid almost fluid loose mixture of mud and dirt and rocks.  Just  when  we
thought the gully couldn\'t get any worse we found it capped by 200  foot  of
hard snow. With the day being reasonably warm we  were  just  able  to  kick
steps up it (none of us had crampons)  but  with  temperatures  forecast  to
soon plummet we all knew it would be a problem on  the  way  down.  To  make
matters even worse just as we topped the crest to Silent Lakes  the  weather
took a nosedive with driving wind and rain. We found a  partially  protected
heather bowl above the upper lake and set up camp (7.5 miles, 4800 ft,  7:15
hrs). My only thought was to crawl into my tent and sleeping bag out of  the
weather and  hole  up  for  the  rest  of  the  night.   But  soon  I  heard
conversation and laughter as everyone else gathered outside for dinner.  How
could I not join them? It took a lot to dampen  the  high  spirits  of  this
group, although I suspect much of it was fueled  by  gourmet  chocolate  and
brandy. Even so, as we heard rain much of the night no  one  had  much  hope
for a decent summit day on the morrow.

Day 2 (Saturday) - We were all stunned to awaken to a  reasonable  day.  The
fog came and went as did the views, but it  was  dry  and  stayed  that  way
until the very end of the day. It  was,  however,  downright  cold  and  had
frozen overnight.  So off we went to try for Arriva first. We were aided  by
Mike Torok\'s report from his and Matt\'s Labor Day trip of  last  year.  From
Upper Silent Lake we made our way to a first notch at 7200  ft  to  cross  a
rocky rib, then made a long up and down rising traverse to  a  second  notch
at 7400 ft leading to a large talus basin below a third  7760  ft  notch  in
Arriva\'s S ridge. A fun class 2-3 scramble along this ridge on ledges and  a
short gully led to the summit block where we had  several  choices.  I  went
all the way to another notch in the E ridge where a class 4  crack  appealed
to me but Beth found an easier all class 3 route by following a  ledge  back
to the S ridge. We were all on the summit by 12:30 (1800 ft, 3:15 hr).

For the way back, the gals followed a low route that went below the  rib  of
the second notch while the guys retraced the high route. We had  to  descend
a few hundred feet but the terrain was mostly heather slopes and easier  and
faster to traverse. We were back in camp by 4:00 where five of us  took  off
immediately for Fisher. Don decided to try his hand  at  fishing  the  lakes
but reported them barren.

Fisher turned out to be a delightful mostly class 3 scramble  along  the  NW
ridge with only one short class 4 section where some might like a rope,  and
we were on the summit by 5:20 (1250 ft, 1:20 hr). Unfortunately the  weather
was deteriorating again and we had no views. We made it back  to  camp  just
as it began to snow lightly. Despite the  snow,  we  had  another  laughter,
chocolate and brandy filled social dinner until the  increasing  cold  drove
even the highest of spirit into warm sleeping bags.

Day 3 (Sunday) - We did not wake to reasonable weather on this day.  It  was
cold and foggy and windy and had snowed maybe an inch. All  thoughts  of  my
staying another day and climbing other  peaks  quickly  evaporated.   A  hot
shower and warm bed sounded mighty appealing. But first we had to  get  down
the dreaded snow slope. If anything it was worse than anticipated  -  frozen
rock solid and impossible to kick any kind of a decent step  into.  Our  one
rope was only 120 ft long but we managed to get down the steepest part  with
one double rope rappel from a boulder anchor at the top and  a  single  rope
rappel from a chopped ledge and bollard anchor in the middle. This left  Jim
to downclimb belayed by Kevin from another bollard. There was  just  no  way
to get an ice axe all the way into the snow. After all of us made it  safely
down the snow the rest of the gully seemed a piece of cake.  We  ambled  the
rest of the way  to  the  TH  accompanied  by  intermittent  snow  and  rain
showers.  None of us minded. We were all grateful to have  squeaked  in  our
two peaks during the only possible weather window. (7.5 miles,  1700  ft,  7
hrs).

Total: 20 miles and 10,200 ft in 3 days

South Twin Sister (7000+ ft - 3520P) - Twin Sisters Mtn Quad - September
10, 2008

Okay, so I feel really stupid, although I like to think my error is  due  to
the fact that I am a perennial optimist. When I came to the bridge over  the
Middle Fork Nooksack River on the approach road to Twin Sisters I  found  no
warning signs and saw no gate. I suppose  I  should  have  known  better  as
there was a gate somewhere hereabouts when I climbed North Twin a few  years
ago and all recent descriptions start the climb by biking up the  road  from
the gate. I did have a bike with me and I did expect to use it.  But  things
could have changed as there were signs of new repair work  near  the  bridge
and I optimistically thought maybe they had removed the gate and opened  the
road to the public. So I just kept driving feeling very lucky. I  felt  even
luckier when I discovered the side road toward  the  Twins  was  also  newly
bulldozed and I could drive the spur road all the way to  its  end  at  3300
ft. However, I didn\'t feel so lucky on the return.

By saving some 5 miles (one way) and a couple of hours of  biking  by  being
able to drive so high, I felt much less time pressure so was  able  to  take
my time to thoroughly enjoy the  climb.  I  followed  the  remnants  of  the
abandoned road beyond where I parked about 0.75 mile, where I  then  picked  up
the rough climber\'s trail that leads to the  large  basin  between  the  two
Twin Sisters.  I stayed too high, ignoring a cairned trail into  brush,  and
lost time traversing cliffy and scrubby terrain to reach  the  upper  basin.
It is best to get into the basin lower. I corrected this mistake on the  way
out. From the basin I worked my way up the north side onto  the  west  ridge
to a notch just before Pt 6405. From there  I  followed  the  ridge  to  the
summit. If you stay on route and follow the easiest path the whole climb  is
class 2-3. Much of the way is cairned. Several  pinnacles  are  bypassed  on
ledges first on the south then on the north. The final climb to  the  summit
plateau is on the south side.  The  rock  is  that  wonderful  reddish-brown
periodotite that makes  for  delightful  scrambling  (and  makes  N  Twin  a
classic) and in several places I couldn\'t resist foregoing sandy ledges  for
better climbing.  Be aware though that it is farther along  the  west  ridge
to the summit than it looks and takes longer  than  one  might  think  (2.75
miles, 3900 ft, 5 hrs).

Although according to the map the high point of 7000+ ft  is  the  NW  bump,
the register is on the SE  bump  which  actually  also  read  higher  on  my
altimeter. The register was placed in 1997 and filled with the usual  scraps
of paper which although dry were still mostly illegible. The only entries  I
recognized, that I was able to read, were by Jim  Brisbine  on  8/10/03  and
Paul Klenke/Jeff Rodgers on 7/15/06. The most recent ascent was  5/25/08.  I
added my name and a few sheets of waterproof paper. I stayed 40  minutes  on
top before taking almost 4 hours to descend, not being terribly faster  than
on the way up.

I was feeling pretty pleased with myself at finally bagging this peak  until
driving out and being shocked to  see  a  closed  and  locked  gate  on  the
bridge. I swear I hadn\'t seen it in  the  morning.  It  was  on  the  bridge
itself and I guess in the open position had looked like part of  the  bridge
guard rail. But I am certain there were no warning signs. I am usually  very
careful about not driving through open gates for fear  of  this  very  thing
happening but this one took me completely by surprise. What to  do?  Well  I
had seen an open gate on the Blue Mtn Road off Mosquito  Lake  Road  on  the
drive in. The map indicated that road connected with  the  road  I  was  on.
Maybe I would get lucky and that gate would still be open. I was not  lucky.
By the time I got there, after driving some 10  winding  dusty  miles,  that
gate was closed and locked also. There was no help for it. I would  have  to
wait it out till morning (I sure am glad this wasn\'t a Friday). I decided  I
would stay at this gate as it was closer to my route home and I  thought  it
might be opened earlier than the other gate.  I  found  a  partially  hidden
spot off the road a short ways away  for  my  second  unplanned  peak  bivy,
although I am not sure if a car bivy counts.

I was a little cramped as I had a bike in the car and  I  did  not  want  to
remove it so I could make a fast getaway. I did have  a  change  of  clothes
and a blanket and enough to drink. My main problem was I was very hungry.  I
didn\'t have enough food with me.  Precisely at 3:50 am I was awakened  by  a
large dump truck driving by. These guys sure start work  early!  30  seconds
later I pulled out of my bivy hoping I didn\'t meet a logging or  dump  truck
caravan and that the gate was now open. I didn\'t and it was. I  was  out  of
there without being seen. Such an early start allowed me to get  home  by  6
am and miss all the morning rush hour. Even so I was surprised by  how  much
traffic there is at 5 am during a weekday. Being a night person I am  rarely
up at that hour.

Such was the ignominious end to a very nice climb.

Day 1 (Saturday) - Mike and I had been trying to get this peak for a  couple
of years but things never quite  worked  out.  It  all  came  together  when
Stefan invited us to join  him  and  Greg  on  this  beautiful  weekend.  We
couldn\'t have had nicer weather. Due to family commitments, Stefan  couldn\'t
leave town until fairly late, so  Mike  and  I  decided  to  go  up  earlier
together so we could take our time. Mike drove his truck up  the  rough  but
reasonably passable road to Twin Lakes and the High Pass TH  (5200  ft).  We
were both shocked at the  number  of  vehicles  parked  at  these  otherwise
beautiful lakes. There must have been close to 50 with  another  50  at  the
Yellow Aster Butte TH  farther  down.  Good  weather  sure  brings  out  the
hordes.

We started for High Pass at 12:45 taking a tad over an hour to get there  (2
miles, 1100 ft). From there we dropped down a couple of hundred feet on  the
Gargett Mine trail to where it crossed the creek, descended  a  few  hundred
more feet and then traversed across this first basin to cross a  wooded  rib
at about 5400 ft. We were following Paul Klenke\'s excellent TR and  pictures
from September 9, 2007 which saved us a lot of time and possible  confusion.
Much to our surprise we ran into a couple coming  out  while  crossing  this
first rib. They had not made the summit, being put off by a distant view  of
"hanging snow" in the snow gully but they had not  investigated  closer.  We
thought this a bit odd and not at all typical  of  hard  core  climbers  and
concluded one or  the  other  was  psyched  out  and  just  didn\'t  want  to
continue.

We crossed the second basin and rib high through a  6240  ft  notch.  Up  to
this point the approach was fairly pleasant but the climb to this notch  was
anything but. The last bit was very steep loose scree and dirt. The  descent
down the other side into the third basin and to  our  intended  campsite  at
5600 ft was no better. The rocks were bigger but still  just  as  loose.  At
the base of a dwindling snowpatch we found a semi-level  vegetated  spot  to
camp with an old stone wall. Although one would be hard-pressed  to  find  a
spot big enough for a full sized tent  it  was  reasonably  comfortable  for
bivys. Just downhill of  the  snowpatch  we  found  running  water  when  we
arrived at 5:00  (3.5  miles,  2000  ft,  4:15  hr).  It  is  noteworthy  to
emphasize though, just as Klenke observed, that when we  returned  the  next
day at 1:30 there was no running water. In anticipation of this Mike  filled
a large bag.

Even though they left well after us, Stefan and  Greg  showed  up  at  6:30.
They must have really been moving. We had all agreed to bring no  stove  and
have cold dinners. After all it was only  one  night  and  the  weather  was
warm. I do like  my  cup  of  tea  with  dinner  though,  so  I  decided  to
experiment with a tiny Esbit stove that used  solid  fuel  cubes.  With  one
fuel cube the whole thing only weighed 1.5 oz. Paired with  a  titanium  cup
it seemed like the perfect setup for a light bivy. Well, it  turned  out  to
be a total bust. What they don\'t tell you is that those fuel cubes stink  to
high heaven while burning. I ended up almost poisoning poor  Mike  and  Greg
with the fumes and ruining their appetites to boot (they  were  downwind  of
me). Then the cubes are terribly  inefficient.  It  took  about  15  minutes
using a whole cube to heat one cup of water and it  never  even  boiled.  It
did get hot enough to brew my tea but it was not worth the wait and smell.

Day 2 (Sunday) - We started at 6:30 taking a  high  route  at  the  base  of
slabs to climb to the 6840 ft saddle in the American  Border-Larrabee  ridge
(1250 ft, 1 hr). From the saddle we picked up a faint trail along the  crest
until coming to nasty looking grey slabs on the right  side.  A  nice  ledge
crossed below these slabs to a gully left of "de Gaulle\'s Nose". This  gully
had a steep step and lots of loose rock. From the top of the gully we  could
see the snow gully that had turned back the  couple.  Goodness  gracious  it
didn\'t look bad at all and other than more horribly  loose  rock  above  and
below the snow it wasn\'t. We easily crawled the right  hand  moat.  No  snow
gear needed at all. From the notch at the top a narrow  ledge,  exposed  but
easily scrambled, led to the base of the chimney.

Here we roped up. Stefan led directly up the  5.4  route  into  the  Chimney
with Greg following. Mike opted for the Klenke  class  4  bypass  which  was
fine by me. Easier is better as far as I am concerned. Mike set up  a  belay
to the side and we waited until Stefan and Greg were  all  the  way  up  the
chimney before I led through.  The  first  part  of  the  chimney  was  easy
scrambling until reaching two chockstones. The last one gave me trouble.  At
the top of the chimney was the keyhole which even I  had  a  little  trouble
squeezing through even after taking off my pack. It is not very big.

We scrambled another steep loose gully above the chimney to get to the  easy
summit ridge, bypassed a pinnacle on the  left  and  climbed  to  the  final
summit tower arriving on top at 10:00  (2300  ft,  3:30  hr).  There  was  a
register with the usual scraps of paper so I added a waterproof notebook.  I
really don\'t understand why so many registers have just scraps of  paper  in
them. If someone goes to the trouble of bringing up a register container  in
the first place why not include  a  (preferably  waterproof)  notebook?  Why
just scraps  of  paper,  which  are  often  just  the  back  side  of  route
descriptions as if no other paper was available? Oh well, I  guess  it  just
serves to give me a mission in life.

A handline was used down the first gully above the chimney. We  set  up  two
single rope rappels down the chimney to make the ropes easier  to  pull  and
each person rappelled all the way to the bottom to be out  of  the  line  of
rockfall. The rest of the route we downclimbed. We  were  back  in  camp  at
1:30. Stefan and Greg left 15 minutes later, Mike and  I  15  minutes  after
that. By the time we reached the High Pass trail 2.5  hours  later  we  had
both had enough of scree  and  talus  and  sidehilling  and  our  feet  were
complaining loudly. In comparison the last hour to the TH was heaven  to  be
on level trail. (3.5 miles, 1600 ft, 3:40 hrs from camp).

Total: 10 miles and 6000 ft in 2 days

(5327 ft - 687P) - Glacier Quad - September 17-18, 2008

Canyon Ridge is a beautiful lonesome ridge  about  8  miles  long  a  couple
miles south of the Canadian Border and north of Bearpaw Mtn. Counting  Cowap
Pk at the east edge, there are 4 peaks of prominence  along  its  length.  A
trail follows most of the ridge but it is little used and hard to follow  in
spots especially in meadowy areas at the west end. My plan was to  car  camp
at the Damfino Lakes TH at the east end  to  also  allow  time  to  hike  to
Excelsior Pass and the superb High Divide Trail which is gorgeous this  time
of year.

Day 1: Cowap and East & Middle Canyon Ridge  -  I  began  from  the  Damfino
Lakes TH which is some 15 miles up Road 31  (Canyon  Cr  Road)  off  the  Mt
Baker Highway. I followed the Damfino Lakes Trail .7  miles  to  the  Canyon
Ridge Trail junction and this trail .4 miles farther  to  the  Boundary  Way
Trail. This trail can be followed to the NE ridge  for  a  walkup  route  on
Cowap but I chose a shorter faster route directly up   a  steep  gully  that
hit the ridge just SW of the summit and involved a short scramble. From  the
summit I had a splendid though somewhat hazy view of  American  Border  Peak
where I had just been a few days before (1450 ft, 1:30 hr).

From Cowap I followed  the  ridge  SW  and  then  W  (some  brush)  until  I
intersected the Canyon Ridge Trail which then led all the way to the  summit
of East Canyon Ridge (3 hrs). The trail was fairly good to this point.  From
there on it was unmaintained and deteriorated as it went up and  down  along
the ridge until I lost it completely in extensive wet  (and  buggy)  meadows
in the broad saddle between Middle Canyon  and  Liumchen  Mtn.  This  latter
peak is in B.C., very close at this point and  rather  attractive.  I  would
have liked to have climbed it also but it was  another  1000  ft  or  so  of
elevation and I just didn\'t have the time.  As  it  was,  I  reached  Middle
Canyon summit at the late hour of 5:00 and I even had to forego West  Canyon
Ridge which was about another 2.5 rugged miles distant. The whole ridge  had
taken longer to traverse than I had anticipated. I barely made  it  back  to
the TH before dark even taking a shortcut directly  down  to  the  road  (11
miles, 3400 ft, 7:45 hrs). The days are definitely getting shorter.

Day 2: Excelsior Pass  and  High  Divide  Trail  -  This  is  an  absolutely
gorgeous trail and highly recommended as a mellow trip.  But  just  in  case
some of you might think I have slipped a cog hiking a trail that had no  new
peaks for me along it (I had previously done them all from Welcome Pass),  I
did have an ulterior motive. When camping on the ridge to  do  Damfino  Peak
back in June I had lost my spoon and I wanted to see if  I  could  find  it.
You might think that was a lot of trouble to go to just for a spoon  but  it
was my favorite (expensive) titanium spoon. I also  discovered  it  was  not
available anymore and could not be replaced. All  I  could  find  were  much
larger ones or sporks, which I don\'t care for. Besides,  that  spoon  and  I
had shared many a mountain  meal  together  and  I  just  couldn\'t  bear  to
abandon it without at least trying to find it. I did find it and had a  most
enjoyable trail hike in the process of doing so  (12  miles,  2600  ft  5:20
hr).

West Canyon Ridge - I still wanted to pick up this peak.  The  Canyon  Ridge
trail can also be accessed from the west end off Road 3140  so  on  the  way
out I drove up this road which is in good shape to the  ridge  saddle  (4400
ft). The trail doesn\'t start here but starts from the end of  a  very  rough
road that switchbacks downhill to 4000 ft. I drove this road for  1.2  miles
as far I dared then started hiking. The trail climbs over a spur  saddle  at
4400 ft and descends to a meadow at 4200.  I  could  see  it  was  going  to
descend even farther to get around the cliffs on  the  north  side  of  West
Canyon Ridge before climbing back  to  the  ridge  on  the  east.  I  hadn\'t
counted on such a roundabout route. From the 4200  ft  meadow  I  spotted  a
steep vegetated slope that looked like it would go all the way to  the  west
ridge through the cliffs. This worked well but then I ran into cliffs  at  a
200 ft step along the ridge and, although I forced a way up, I did a lot  of
zigging and zagging and using bush belays to pull myself up.   Once  on  the
summit (1:45 hr) I didn\'t think I could safely go back down the  way  I  had
come up. So I continued east along the ridge, dropping  to  the  north  once
past cliffs to pick up the trail and follow it back to  the  car  (3  miles,
2000 ft and 3:20 hrs). My assessment  is  that  West  Canyon  Ridge  is  for
demented peakbaggers only. It is fairly brushy, has no real  views  and  the
trail (and road) to get near it is steep, rough and wanders all over out  of
the way. For enjoyment stick to the east portion of Canyon Ridge.

Day 1: Cowap and East & Middle Canyon Ridge - I used the last  of  the  good
weather spell to hike this mellow pleasant ridge ramble. I  began  from  the

Mt Baker Highway. I followed the Damfino Lake Trail .7 miles to  the  Canyon

I spent 4 glorious days wandering open high country  from  a  base  camp  at
Fool Hen Lake. This area is truly a ridge rambler\'s delight and  appears  to
be little visited. I found no registers on any of the summits  but  expected
this and took enough of my own for all of them except Diamond  Pt.  Many  of
the minor trails are hard to follow or  non-existent,  but  the  terrain  is
mellow and crosscountry travel easy  most  everywhere,  although  there  are
many ups and downs. The only downside is much of the scenery  is  marred  by
the aftereffects of the extensive fires of recent years.

Day 1 (Friday): Billy Goat Mtn 1 and Billy Goat Mtn 2 - I started  from  the
Billy Goat TH at 12:15. My goal was to reach Fool Hen  Lake  but  I  knew  I
would be hard pressed to do that before dark. I reached Billy Goat  Pass  at
1:45 where I met two hunters coming out. The High Hunt had  just  ended  the
previous day. These were the only people I saw the entire trip. At the  pass
I picked up the marked Burch Mtn Trail which climbs high  on  the  flank  of
Billy Goat 3 before dropping to the saddle  with  Burch  Mtn.  Larches  were
lovely here, just beginning to turn golden. I had previously  climbed  Billy
Goat 3 and Burch so  could  bypass  them  both,  but  I  actually  ended  up
following the trail almost all the way to the summit of Burch once again  as
this was easier than trying to go around on the cliffy north side.  Once  on
the ridge it was easy travel over Billy Goat 2 and on to Billy Goat 1  (4900
ft, 6:30 hrs).

It was now 6:45 and rapidly getting dark. I traversed most of the  way  past
Pt 7987 before needing a headlamp. My main worry was finding a way  off  the
ridge. My hope was to find Trail 532 that The Billy Goat  Mtn  Green  Trails
map shows crossing the ridge at "Fool Hen Pass", but it was also  marked  as
" hard to follow" so I wasn\'t surprised when I found no sign of  it  when  I
reached the broad pass in the  dark.  I  briefly  considered  camping  right
there but there was no water and I had very little left to get  through  the
night. So I decided to try to just head to  Fool  Hen  Lake  by  my  GPS.  I
continued along the ridge over Pt 7836 and up toward Pt  8062  to  get  past
cliffs to where I could descend more easily and by  golly  I  stumbled  onto
the large cairn that marked the spot where the trail  exited  the  ridge  at
about 7900 ft. It was really quite good as it switchbacked down but  I  lost
it again in a basin at 7400 ft. I continued  blindly  on  following  my  GPS
wandering up and down on a steep traverse above cliffs  until  I  reached  a
gentle basin and could descend toward the  lake.  A  little  after  10:00  I
joyfully found running water (the first all day) and set up my tent  on  the
first flat spot I found. It turned out to be a primo spot. Not too  bad  for
a choice made in the dark (10 miles, 5700 ft, 10 hrs).

Day 2 (Saturday): Fool Hen Pk, Billy Goat Mtn 4, Diamond Pt, Ashnola Pass  1
(aka Diamond Ridge) and Ashnola Pass 2 -  Another advantage of my choice  of
campsite that I wasn\'t aware of the night before was that  it  captured  the
morning sun very early, a real bonus as it froze during the  night.  But  by
the time I began the day at 8:30 I was nicely warmed up.  Fool Hen Pk was  a
simple and leisurely 50 minutes above camp. Then it was  on  to  Billy  Goat
Mtn 4. I had first to descend to tarn  7119.  I  had  thought  that  in  the
daylight I would be able to find Trail 532  in  the  basin  above  Hen  Fool
Lake. I didn\'t. In fact I never saw any sign of the trail until I  descended
onto the open flat spur below Pt 7615. Here  the  trail  magically  appeared
and was fairly good all the way to "Diamond Pass".

Billy Goat Mtn 4 was a short pleasant hike  off  the  trail  after  which  I
continued to Diamond Pass where the main trail led all the  way  to  Diamond
Point, a former lookout site. From Diamond Point I followed the  easy  ridge
to Ashnola Pass 1. More easy terrain led down to  the  saddle  with  Ashnola
Pass 2, where I crossed Trail 532 and noted its location for  my  return.  I
had thought that I would have trouble fitting all five objective peaks  into
one day, but the terrain was so easy that I reached Ashnola Pass 2 at  3:20.
That did not mean, though, that I had much time to spare before  dark  as  I
still had a long way to get back to camp. But the whole day went faster  and
easier than anticipated.

I returned to the saddle where I picked up Trail 532. It started quite  good
and I  thought  I  would  have  no  trouble  following  it  but  it  quickly
deteriorated and became quite faint. It was well cairned, however, and  with
care I was able to stay with it back to Diamond Pass  and  on  to  the  spur
about tarn 7119 where I again lost the trail. I pulled into camp at 6:50  in
fading light, very pleased with my pleasant day of high ridge  rambling  (13
miles, 5700 ft, 10:20 hrs).

Day 3(Sunday): Billy Goat Mtn 5 and Ashnola Pass 3  (aka  Flintstone  Pk)  -
Again I was on my way at 8:30. I wasn\'t all  that  thrilled  with  my  first
objective of Billy Goat Mtn 5. It really didn\'t  look  very  interesting  on
the map but it turned out to be  delightful.  Despite  traversing  a  recent
burn the terrain was rather attractive with open meadows and the odd  golden
larch contrasting picturesquely with blackened trees. I reached  the  summit
at 10:50 where I had a good  view  of  Ashnola  Pass  3,  my  next  possible
objective. This peak looked to be a bit  more  difficult  than  any  of  the
others, was a long ways away and involved an elevation loss of  2000  ft.  I
considered passing on it and just going back to camp early but the  day  was
too nice not to continue even though I knew I  would  be  returning  in  the
dark.

I returned to the ridge saddle before  dropping  to  Fox  Cr  Trail  514.  I
followed this trail to Lake Cr Trail 500 at the distressingly low  elevation
of 5300 ft and then climbed along Lake Cr toward Ashnola Pass.  I  left  the
trail at 6100 ft and worked my way  up  a  series  of  gullies  that  snaked
through broken cliffs arriving at the summit plateau at  3:30  (3400  ft,  7
hr). I descended the same way and followed Trail 514 until I  could  take  a
short cut to Fox Lakes, rather than continue all the way to Diamond Pass.  I
reached the lower lake with just enough light to find a trail. There were  a
number of confusing way trails in this area, none of which were  marked,  so
I was very relieved when I finally came  to  the  junction  with  Trail  532
(also unmarked) and was once again on familiar territory. I reached camp  at
8:30, another long but rewarding day (15 miles, 5900 ft, 12 hrs).

Day 4 (Monday) - I slept in until awakened by sun on my tent.  I  soaked  my
tired feet in the lake before packing up and heading out at 10:00.  I  found
no trace of Trail 532 on the traverse above Fool  Hen  Lake  until  reaching
the basin where I had lost it on the way in. I have no idea  where  it  goes
or if it even exists in this area. But I was thankful for the  section  that
climbed up to the large cairn on the ridge above Fool  Hen  Pass.  I  stayed
with the trail over Pt 7836 but lost it in the broad pass  itself.  The  map
shows the trail dropping on a long traverse to Drake Cr but I couldn\'t  find
it so just headed downhill. I came upon it a couple of hundred  feet  below,
much lower than I would have expected. I  soon  lost  it  again  and  headed
straight downhill to Drake Cr. On the other side of the creek I came upon  a
fairly good trail that led to the well used Billy  Goat  Pass  trail  at  an
unmarked junction. Then it was just a short jaunt up to Billy Goat Pass  and
down the other side to the TH which I reached at 3:00 and the end to a  most
pleasant trip. (8 miles, 1700 ft, 5 hrs)

Total: 46 miles and 19,000 ft in 4 days

I spent Wednesday and Thursday climbing these 9 peaks near Packwood.

Strawberry Mtn (5739 ft -  1859P)  and  Strawberry  LO  (5440+  ft  -  560P)
-Taking a cue from John, the first  day  I  climbed  these  two  peaks.  The
weather was sunny and bright but my enjoyment  of  the  lovely  terrain  was
tempered by gale force winds. I had trouble keeping my balance on  the  open
sections of the ridge which translates to about  50  mph  gusts.  I  made  a
direct assault from the south on The Strawberry, no more than class 3,  then
made the mistake of taking off my gloves on top and having one  blown  away.
I spent the next 20 minutes searching for it on a steep  snowy  hillside  to
the northwest. I did find it which was a good thing as it was the only  pair
I had with me (6.7 miles, 2100 ft, 3:50 hrs RT). Then I had trouble  finding
the trail to Strawberry LO as it does not start right from the saddle  so  I
went straight up from the road to the east.  I  came  down  the  trail  (1.2
miles, 575 ft, :50 hrs).

Spirit Lake East 3 (4581 ft - 461P) - I had hoped to drive on to the  Norway
Pass TH and climb a few peaks there but I discovered Road 99 gated  shut  at
the Bear Meadow Viewpoint. So Instead  I  climbed  this  peak  by  following
Boundary Trail 1 until as close as possible and then  going  uphill  to  the
top (1.4 miles, 660 ft, 1:20 hrs). I spent the  night  at  the  Bear  Meadow
Viewpoint.

The next day I gave my poor Jeep a real workout.

French Butte 3 (4520+ ft - 400P) - This peak was an  easy  stroll  from  the
nearest point on the road to the east that left Road  25  at  Elk  Pass  (.3
miles, 180 ft, :20 hrs).

French Butte 2 (4560+ t - 440P) - I accessed this peak from a  road  several
miles south of Elk Pass. The road started well but the spur  that  heads  up
the peak required high clearance and low range 4X4. I was able to  drive  to
the last switchback where a fallen tree blocked the way (.6 miles,  120  ft,
:25 hrs).

French Butte 4 (4120+ ft - 400P)  -  The  road  for  this  peak  is  on  the
opposite side of Road 25 from the above one. It is  rather  obscure  but  do
not despair. It is actually better than it looks at the start and  is  quite
drivable by any 4 wheel drive. I was stopped  but  a  large  tree  past  the
switchback and very near the end of the road.  There  is  a  nice  viewpoint
just west of the summit (.5 miles, 90 ft, :18 Hrs).

The Loaf (4520+ ft - 360P) - I drove back to Elk Pass and  took  a  road  to
the east hoping to get close enough to climb The Loaf. I  was  shocked  when
about 3 miles in I came to a gate proclaiming the road closed  to  motorized
vehicles. I am not sure why. But I could see vehicle tracks in the  snow  on
the other side of the gate and on closer examination I discovered  the  gate
was not locked and could not be locked due to being  deformed.  Knowing  the
gate could not be locked behind me  gave me the  courage  to  drive  through
though I still worried about getting caught. But it would not be as  bad  as
getting caught in the Cedar River Watershed. So I was able  to  drive  to  a
point very close to my objective and climb to the top  (.5  miles,  420  ft,
:45 hrs).

French Butte 1 (5360 ft - 400P) - As long as  I  was  already  in  forbidden
territory I decided to go for this peak also. I drove a 4X4 spur to its  end
and parked. I  felt  fairly  comfortable  parking  here  as  there  were  no
previous tracks in the snow and the road  was  rough  enough  I  thought  it
unlikely anyone would drive up it. This peak turned out to take  longer  and
to be more of a  challenge  than  I  thought.  In  keeping  with  its  named
neighbors (most of which I had climbed years ago) it  too  was  quite  rocky
and cliffy.

I worked my way through old  clearcut  and  open  forest  to  intersect  the
Boundary Trail on the ridge above Badger Lake  and followed  this  trail  to
the saddle north of the peak. I tried a direct approach up the  north  ridge
but ran into a cliff about 100 ft below the summit. It probably  could  have
been climbed (class 4) but it was wet and had snow  on  it  and  I  couldn\'t
tell if there were more cliffs beyond the initial  one.  I  decided  not  to
risk it and descended several hundred feet back to trail to follow it  until
past all the cliffs and gain the south ridge. That worked well.  The  summit
was rocky and open, the nicest summit of the day (3  miles,  1700  ft,  2:50
hrs). A view of The Loaf from the top clearly showed why it was so named.

French Butte (5306 ft - 1346P) - I still had a little time left in  the  day
and thought it appropriate to climb the peak for which the quad is named.  A
road goes all the way to the top. How hard could it be? Well, something  has
happened to this road since I drove it years ago to  climb  Pinto  Rock.  It
has deteriorated to a genuine 4X4 road. Do not even  try  this  road  unless
you have a high clearance 4X4 with low range gears. It is  awful  with  huge
tire swallowing ruts. It is steep too boot. After crawling  and  bumping  my
way at an average speed of maybe 6 mph up the 3.5 mile road when I  came  to
the final spur to the top I had had enough and walked the rest of  the  way.
Actually I probably could have driven it as it was no worse than what I  had
already done but I need to quit  rattling  and  shaking  for  a  while.  (.6
miles, 190 ft, :15 hrs).

Then I had to drive back down the road!

Mt Hardy is most often climbed, I think, directly from  Hwy  20  near  Swamp
Cr. If that is all you are doing that certainly makes the most sense. But  I
had other plans and other peaks I hoped  to  climb  along  the  way  and  so
planned to climb it from Methow Pass with a camp at Cutthroat  Pass.  Beside
I wanted to return to the spectacular area near Tower Mtn and Goldenhorn.

Day 1 (Saturday): WashingtonPass2 - When I arrived at the PCT  North  TH  at
Rainy Pass I was greeted with several inches of new snow in the parking  lot
and could see more snow higher up. This did not bode well for making it  all
the way to Mt Hardy. Despite it being after noon  and  now  a  lovely  sunny
day, no one had been up the trail before me. Where the sun hit  open  slopes
there was actually very little snow, but in protected shady areas I  had  to
break trail in 8-12 inches. This all slowed  me  down  and  I  didn\'t  reach
Cutthroat Pass until 3:45 (5 miles, 2000 ft, 3:20 hrs).

I quickly set up camp on a bare patch of ground in full sun and set off  for
WashingtonPass2. This was a short pleasant stroll  up  gentle  south  facing
and hence little snow covered slopes. From the summit  views  were  gorgeous
and I could see my entire route along the PCT  to  Methow  Pass.  The  north
facing slopes on the descent to Granite  Pass  looked  very  snowy  but  the
trail was clearly visible and the long south  facing  traverse  below  Tower
Mtn was almost completely snow free. I breathed a sigh of  relief.  Snow  on
this traverse would have made my objective almost  impossible  to  reach  in
one day. As it was I would be pushing it but I thought it was still doable.

On the way down I made a small detour to find running water for  the  night.
I reached camp at 6:15 (1.5 miles, 750 ft, 1:50 hr RT) and settled in for  a
very long cold night.

Day 2 (Sunday): Mt Hardy and WashingtonPass3 - It was indeed a  cold  night.
My second water bottle inside my tent froze such that  I  couldn\'t  get  the
water out without heating it up first. I did have the bottle  I  put  in  my
sleeping bag to help with this. Fortunately I  had  deliberately  chosen  my
campsite to catch the early morning sun, if you  consider  8:00  early,  and
things quickly warmed up. The traverse to the high point above Granite  Pass
had a fair amount of snow, much of it now annoying breakable crust that  had
partially frozen during night, and was slow going. The  600  ft  descent  to
Granite Pass had drifts to knee  deep  but  it  was  powdery  and  no  great
problem.

At the pass I left the trail and ambled up easy south slopes to  the  summit
of WashingtonPass3. On the way I  was  startled  to  come  across  an  alien
rocket ship communications tower of some sort. You just can\'t get away  from
these things no matter where you go. At least this one was not on  the  high
point, was next to a tall tree and was camouflaged  so  it  was  not  really
very visible from afar. I descended  snowy  north  slopes,  winding  my  way
through a few unexpected cliffs, to intersect the trail once again  a  short
ways below the saddle with Tower Mtn.

The next 2 miles of traverse to Methow Pass was mostly snow  free  and  went
quickly. I had never paid much attention to  Mt  Hardy  during  my  previous
trip to area, but Hardy is really a very good  looking  peak,  even  holding
its own with nearby higher Tower Mtn and  Golden  Horn.   From  the  pass  I
followed the ridge W  through  booby  trapped  powder  covered  talus  until
reaching the steep sunny SE slope. I worked past a couple ridge bumps and  a
final notch until I could climb the final  easy  ramp  to  the  airy  summit
blocks (7 miles, 2900 ft, 7 hrs).

It was now 3:30. Actually for a while I thought it  was  only  2:30.  I  was
going by the time on my GPS and it was  set  to  automatically  change  from
Daylight Time at the old date (which was today) and not the new date  (which
is next Sunday). Then I looked at my watch and instantly lost  an  hour.  Oh
these electronic gadgets that think for you! My VCR did the  same  thing  at
home and taped a program  at  the  wrong  time.  When  Congress  willy-nilly
changed the date for ending (and starting) Daylight  Time  saying  it  would
save energy  or  some  such  nonsense  they  gave  no  thought  to  all  the
preprogrammed electronics out there. But I digress.

The bottom line was I would be returning by headlight, not that that  was  a
great problem. In fact I welcomed it. I would rather spend  a  couple  extra
hours on the trail than in the  tent.  However,  by  the  time  I  made  the
seemingly endless pull up out of Granite Pass and  then  the  long  traverse
from the top across snow that had once again frozen to breakable  crust,  my
tent was looking pretty good to me (13.5  miles,  4000  ft,  11  hrs).  This
night was noticeably warmer than the previous one and my  water  bottle  did
not freeze.

Day 3 (Monday): Porcupine Pk - What a glorious day this turned  out  to  be.
It was so beautiful I was reluctant to leave. I  had  Porcupine  Pk  in  the
back of my mind to climb on the way out, but I wasn\'t sure I was up  to  it.
About a month ago I seriously injured my right shoulder in a short fall  and
have had limited use of that arm ever since.  Although  it  hasn\'t  kept  me
from going out, I have stayed with mellow  trips,  mostly  on  trails,  that
involved no serious scrambling, and it has gradually been getting better.  I
had very little information on how difficult Porcupine  was.  Beckey  wasn\'t
very helpful either, but when I got an actual look at the peak I  could  see
it might be a problem. Still, the day was so nice I just had to  give  it  a
try.

I descended the trail to about  5900  ft,  stashed  my  overnight  gear  and
headed up at 10:40 through open woods to the basin  SE  of  Porcupine.  Part
way up I had to shed long underwear as it gradually turned to a  summer-like
almost hot day.  Porcupine Basin was beautiful and generally  snow  free.  I
worked my way through a short cliff band  onto  upper  slopes  and  to  just
below the saddle in the  south  ridge.  Yes  it  did  look  like  a  serious
scramble from here, but a nice ramp led  diagonally  upward  and  it  didn\'t
look too hard so on I went. I crossed two ribs  and  gullies  to  reach  the
blocky ridge crest and thought I had it  made.   But  remember  one  of  the
basic laws of climbing - "there is always a false  summit".  I  topped  out,
descended slightly to a small  notch  and  a  final  wicked  looking  narrow
vertical exposed 20 ft pitch. My heart fell. This was more than I  bargained
for in my condition. Then I looked at it more closely. It  was  more  broken
than at first appearance. I would call it class 4 but the  holds  were  good
and really didn\'t give me any trouble even with my gimpy  arm.  I  guess  it
really is getting better. I reached the summit at 1:20 absolutely  delighted
with both the peak and my performance. I hung around on top for a good  half
hour enjoying the views and sun. I highly recommend  this  peak  as  a  very
pleasant scramble.

I was back to a my pack at 3:30 (2 miles, 1900 ft, 4:50 hrs RT) and the  car
at 4:45 to end 3 days of gorgeous weather in late October.  Who  would  have
thought?

Total: 27 miles and 7900 ft in 3 days

had the most trouble finding a way up Sam Henry as the  TOPO!  map  and  the

road I could drive to very near the summit. The other two  had  gated  roads
to towers on the top that I walked. I tried Mt Pleasant but it is  too  much
on private property. However, I did also do Ceres Hill (800+  ft  -  240P  -

I had vaguely heard of Silver Star Mtn and the Yacolt Burn  in  the  Gifford
Pinchot National Forest just north of the Columbia  River,  but  because  of
the drive distance and perceived better  things  to  climb  just  never  got
around to going there before now. I didn\'t know what I was missing.  What  a
gem this trip turned out to be!  Although of fairly low  elevation  most  of
the terrain on the mountain is wide  open  meadows  with  expansive  vistas.
This is due to the devastating (at the time) 1902 Yacolt  Fire  that  burned
238,000 acres in 3 days. The lower elevations have since reforested but  the
higher ridges have yet to recover and remain sparsely treed.

I approached from Battleground and Forest Roads 41 and 4109.  Road  4109  is
rough with many deep waterbars (I scrapped bottom with my Subaru on  one  of
them) but is passable to the roomy TH at 3080 ft.  Shortly  before  reaching
it I came face to face with a dead van stopped in the middle of the road.  A
crusty old guy was trying to hand  winch  it  out  of  the  way.  He  seemed
surprised but very happy to see me, explaining he had  a  dead  battery  and
just needed a jump. How he ended up with  a  dead  battery  on  his  vehicle
facing downhill in the middle of the road I never really understood.  But  I
obliged his request and saw him on his way. He was darn lucky I  came  along
as it was a long walk to anywhere and I met no one else the  entire  time  I
was on the forest roads.

A long abandoned Jeep road climbs all the way to the summit of  Silver  Star
on the west side of the ridge, but a  newer  trail  (Ed\'s  Trail)  has  been
constructed on the east side. I took this trail and found it delightful  and
very scenic as it worked its way past the cliffs of Pt 4200.  At  one  point
it went through a natural "doorway" arch.  It  then  descended  slightly  to
the Silver Star-Pt 4200 saddle and a  4-way  intersection  with  the  Silver
Star Trail, the Sturgeon Rock Trail and the Bluff Mtn Trail.  At this  point
I took a side trip  up  The  Sturgeon  Fin,  a  fascinating  outcropping  of
columnar basalt. It is imposing from all but the SW sides, which is an  easy
scramble. I went to the summit  then  followed  the  fin  downhill  a  short
distance to the small cairn marking the highpoint of Clark County. I am  not
really into county high points yet but  in  this  case  I  was  so  close  I
couldn\'t pass it by.

I next followed the old road to the top of Silver Star Mtn  for  lunch  with
great views and shelter from  the  wind  in  the  remains  of  a  demolished
lookout (3.5 miles, 2000 ft, 2:30 hrs). I could see the trail leading  along
the ridge to Bluff Mtn in the distance. Rather  than  return  to  the  4-way
junction, I dropped straight down the east and north side to intersect  this
trail. I was now in heaven. I love ridges and this  was  a  ridge  to  love.
Simply gorgeous.  I passed the junction with the  Starway  Trail  which  the
map showed going over the top of Gumboot 1. I would pick  up  this  peak  on
the way out. The trail contoured around Little Baldy to  the  wooded  saddle
beyond where I left it to follow the ridge to the  grassy  summit  of  Bluff
Mtn (6.5 miles, 2600 ft, 4:30 hrs).

Back at the saddle I climbed open talus to the bare summit of  Little  Baldy
(7.5 miles, 3100 ft, 5:30 hrs)  where  a  welcome  rock  windbreak  provided
relief from the wind scouring the exposed slopes. I continued  down  the  NE
ridge to once again intersect the trail.  In  fading  light  I  reached  the
junction with the Starway Trail (9 miles, 3500 ft,  6:30  hrs).  It  was  my
plan to do Gumboot 1 in the dark thinking it would be  easy  to  follow  the
"trail" to the top by headlamp. Well, this would have been a  good  plan  if
the trail had been a good one. The problem was,  it  was  not.  It  is  very
little  used,  almost  non-existent  in  spots  and  very  hard  to  follow,
particularly in the dark. I lost  it  several  times  in  the  steep  wooded
section down to the saddle at which point I gave up on the  trail  and  just
went up the mostly open grassy ridge to  the  summit.  It  was  fairly  easy
returning to the saddle but I had to take great care in  finding  the  Bluff
Mtn Trail junction again as that ridge is quite cliffy.  Fortunately  I  had
set several key waypoints on my GPS to help with this. But stumbling  around
in the dark looking for the trail, the RT from the  junction  took  3  hours
for a distance of 2 miles and 1000 ft gain. Not too swift.

Once on the good Bluff Mtn trail the rest was a piece of cake. At the  4-way
junction I stayed with the easier to follow old jeep road (rather than  Ed\'s
Trail) and was dazzled by the lights of the Portland-Vancouver  area  on  my
left and a rising partial moon on my right the rest of the way  to  the  TH.
It was always my intention to spend the night  in  the  car  so  I  was  not
unhappy with my arrival time of 10:30. That just  meant  I  didn\'t  have  to
spend excessive time in the sleeping bag.

Total: 14 miles, 5000 ft and 11 hours.

December 3, 2008

It is a long drive to this area and in addition stuff happened. I  went  out
the door without my maps and had to go back for them. I stopped to  get  gas
in Stevenson and then got lost looking for  Willard  and  ended  up  on  the
Underwood Road. I knew I was  going  the  wrong  way  when  I  found  myself
paralleling the Columbia River instead of heading in toward  the  mountains.
To make a long story short it was 1:00 before  I  hit  the  trail  to  Monte
Cristo. Although sunny on the drive down it was now foggy and my  hoped  for
views  did  not  materialize  except  for  a  small  window  when  Mt  Adams
spectacularly made a brief  appearance.  That  almost  made  up  for  seeing
nothing else the rest of the day.

I made short work of the good trail up Monte Cristo and continued along  the
crest a total of about 3 miles to  intersect  an  old  road,  which  I  then
followed to the unnamed high point of Monte Cristo  Range  2.  Another  road
led to near Guler Mtn, a short but brushy off road ascent. I  wandered  more
old roads to Dry Creek Ridge,  an  interesting  small  cinder  hill,  before
completing my loop by headlamp to intersect the trail once again near  Monte
Cristo. I reached the car at 7:30 for  a  comfortable  and  not  excessively
long night, by the time I had dinner, at the Monte  Carlo  TH  a  half  mile
away.

Total: 10.5 miles, 3200 ft and 6:30 hrs.

Monte Carlo (4040+ ft - 880P) - Northwestern Lake Quad - December 4, 2008

I started for Monte Carlo at first light (7:30). The trail  climbed  steeply
for 800 ft then leveled off for a pleasant mile to the  high  point  at  the
south end of the ridge. The weather was clear but  downright  frigid  and  I
had to walk fast to stay warm.

Total: 3 miles, 1000 ft and 1:40 hrs

Gifford Pk (5368 ft - 568P), Gifford Pk Quad 1 (4498 ft -  418P)  and  Berry
Mtn (5000+ ft - 200P) - Gifford Pk Quad - December 4, 2008

Although not that far away as crows fly, it took almost  2  hours  to  drive
the circuitous roads to the TH for these peaks. So once again I got a  later
than hoped for start at 11:00. This TH is part of the  PCT  and  enters  the
south end of the Indian Heaven Wilderness so  I  knew  the  trail  would  be
good. The trail was very good but evidently there had been a lot of rain  in
the area recently, or the ground just doesn\'t  drain  very  well,  as  large
sections of the first part of the trail had puddles  that  had  subsequently
frozen overnight. At one point I thought I had come to a small  lake  except
that the trail led right through the middle of the  ice.  And  at  the  real
lakes many were so high the trail was  under  water  where  it  skirted  the
edge. This made for many detours.

About 1.5 miles in at Sheep Lakes I took  a  side  trip  to  wander  through
leafless berry bushes up Gifford 1. Indian Heaven  is  well  known  for  its
plentiful huckleberries in season and in fact is how it got its name. I  can
see why.  At 3 miles I passed the junction to  the  Indian  Race  Track  and
began a gentle climb in long switchbacks up Berry Mtn.  This peak  has  some
interesting rock outcroppings but the summit itself is  a  trivial  distance
from the trail through forest. From here the way followed the  ridge,  where
an icy wind turned me into a Popsicle, before descending to the saddle  with
Gifford Pk. Shortly thereafter I left the  trail  to  climb  through  gentle
open woods and meadows to the only real snow patch of  the  entire  trip  on
the summit of Gifford. I arrived just as the sun was  setting  but  made  it
back to the trail before needing my headlamp. I reached the car at 8:00  and
spent the night at the TH. There is an official campground here but  it  was
closed for the season and the restroom locked.

Total: 15 miles, 3600 ft and 9 hrs

Little Huckleberry Mtn (4781 ft - 1641P) and Monte Cristo Range 1 (3960+  ft
- 560P) - Little Huckleberry Mtn Quad - December 5, 2008

Little Huckleberry was a very pleasant  well  maintained  trail  to  an  old
lookout site and a great viewpoint. I had fun sitting in the sun and  seeing
where I had been the two previous  days.  I  could  see  the  whole  of  the
horseshoe shaped Monte Cristo Range which  starts  with  Little  Huckleberry
Mtn at the SW end and goes through Monte Cristo 1, Monte Cristo 2 and  Monte
Cristo to end at Monte Carlo on the SE end. I was  also  fascinated  by  the
Big Lava Bed to the west - a huge no man\'s land of rugged lava that  is  now
lightly treed. No road or trail penetrates but Crater  sticking  up  in  the
middle is calling to me and I will have to climb it someday.

I was able to get in one more peak before misfortune struck. I drove  up  an
old rough overgrown road farther than  I  should  have  before  starting  to
walk. I did make it up Monte Cristo Range 1 and  back  to  my  car.  I  even
checked the tires before starting the drive down. In a  previous  outing  to
this general area on  November  15  while  driving  another  rough  road  up
Gifford 3 (3000+ ft) I got a rear flat that destroyed a tire.  I  had  great
difficulty changing that tire (they are  very  big  and  heavy  on  a  Grand
Cherokee) and loosening lug nuts tightened by supermen, having to resort  to
pounding the lug wrench with a hammer to  get  the  job  done.  I  ended  up
buying two new rear tires so they would match.  So I was  slightly  paranoid
(but not so paranoid as to stay off rough roads completely). Well  within  5
minutes of starting down I knew I had another flat, this time in  the  front
as I couldn\'t steer the car. But this second time around I did a better  job
as I had had practice. I had also added a 2 foot steel pipe to my  tool  kit
that fit over the end of the lug wrench for added leverage.  Worked  like  a
charm and I changed the tire in half the  time  as  before.  But  really!  I
hadn\'t had a flat in several years and now all of sudden I have two in  less
than a month. My trips are getting expensive and I may have to rethink  this
whole rough 4X4 driving thing. My vehicle may make it up  the  road  but  my
tires don\'t seem to.

Total: 1.2 miles, 500 ft and :50 hrs

Zekes Pk (4865 ft - 945P) - Index Quad - January 23, 2009

The hardest part of this trip was finding a way to Lake Isabel. I had  heard
there was a trail to the lake but finding it was not easy.   I  first  tried
following directions in the back of the book Hiking Snohomish County by  Ken
Wilcox. He had you going up ORV roads to an old RR grade which then  led  to
the trail. I got no farther than the bridgeless  crossing  of  May  Cr.  His
comment "scamper across on rocks" had me laughing incredulously as I  stared
at the rushing torrent of the creek. He must be talking about  fall  levels.
I could find no way across that did not risk life and limb. To  salvage  the
rest of that day I took a pleasant hike to nearby Wallace  Falls  which  was
also raging.

Back to square one, I reasoned that if I wanted to get  to  Lake  Isabel  my
route could not involve a crossing of May Cr low down. I vaguely  remembered
a route described up Zekes in  Dallas  Kloke\'s  Winter  Climbs  book  but  I
couldn\'t find it. That is because it is not listed under  Z  for  Zekes  but
under N for Nina - Pinta - Zekes traverse. I came  across  it  while  having
nothing better to do than go through the book  page  by  page,  looking  for
future ideas, while passing boring hours  on  jury  duty  (no  I  was  never
selected to be on a jury). Even with this description I had problems.  Kloke
gives very minimal directions and is a  master  at  understatement.  But  at
least I had an approach and a plan.

From Gold Bar I drove Reiter Road past May Cr Road and an old  quarry  to  a
DNR road on the left. This road starts out bad right away with deep  puddles
and whoop de doo\'s. Just past the power line (.4 miles) I took a right  onto
a rough and rocky 4X4 road 1.3 further miles to  a  switchback  and  parked.
The road could probably be driven farther by someone more aggressive  but  I
try to ere on the side of caution when out alone (although  I  don\'t  always
succeed and sometimes still get myself into trouble).  Not  knowing  exactly
where it was, I missed the TH for Lake Isabel and ended up walking past  old
mines to the very end of the road where I forced a route through forest  and
brush up a drainage and over a spur ridge. On the other side I ran into  the
trail which was in good shape but obviously little used. After about Â½  mile
I came to a gully where a massive landslide/avalanche  had  obliterated  the
trail. On the other side I picked up an old road bed. I left this road at  a
switchback, again missing the trail. I was led astray by flagging luring  me
into the woods. The flagging went on for  a  ways  but  seemed  to  have  no
relation to any tread on the ground so eventually I just  ignored  it.  This
area had many large downed trees and progress was slow. Increasing depth  of
often rotten snow and a steepening slope  next  to  a  waterfall  as  I  got
closer to the lake exacerbated the problem.

With all my route errors it took me more than 3 hours to reach the  lake  (3
miles, 2200 ft).  But I was pleasantly surprised to find a pole bridge  over
the slot outlet creek that fed the waterfall and a nice log jam crossing  of
the second outlet creek. I had been concerned about getting across  both  of
these creeks. I do find it somewhat odd that Lake Isabel  has  two  outlets.
From the second outlet I headed  uphill  to  the  right  of  a  small  creek
working my way through minor cliffs.  The  first  500  ft  or  so  were  the
hardest then the slope layed back a bit but the whole way  was  quite  steep
forest.  I hit the ridge right of the summit where icy  snow  made  crampons
useful. Only the very summit was open with extensive views  (4400  ft,  6:15
hrs). I looked at the traverse to Pinta and  Nina  mentioned  by  Kloke  and
described as "intermittently steep".  No kidding! As I mentioned  before  he
is a master of understatement.

Darkness caught me on the way down and I got off my up route near  the  lake
descending slightly to skiers left. This actually turned out to be a  better
way although I still did plenty of hanging off  branches  to  get  down.  At
least I didn\'t need to use my panic rope,  which  I  did  have  along.  Once
below the lake I stumbled onto the trail which was fairly obvious here  even
under snow and I followed it to the old road.  It  hit  the  road  past  the
switchback. I had a little trouble locating the trail past the landslide  in
the dark but once on it I was able to follow that section  all  the  way  to
the main road. Or rather almost to the road, as about 25 feet above  it  the
trail just came to a dead-end on the hillside. No wonder I couldn\'t find  it
on the way up. It is marked by faded blue flagging wrapped  around  a  stick
but it is not obvious and there is little sign of any pathway leading up  to
the trail proper. I wonder if  this  obscure  start  is  all  deliberate  to
prevent the ATVs and motorcycles that swarm the area from trying to use  the
trail.

On the drive down the 4X4 road to the power line I ran into a pickup  coming
up. By now it was about 9:00 at night. I couldn\'t believe it. Fortunately  I
could see their headlights from a long ways off and had time to find a  wide
spot in the mostly narrow road to wait for them to pass. As they went  by  I
could see the two people inside looking  at  me  as  if  I  were  crazy  and
wondering what the heck I was doing there. I was wondering  the  same  about
them. At least I was on my way home. What were they doing going up the  road
in the dark? Probably I don\'t want to know.

Total: 8 miles, 4500 ft and 10:45 hrs.

Directions to Lake Isabel:  From Gold Bar drive Reiter Rd past an  operating
gravel pit on the right to an old gravel pit  on  the  left.  Large  parking
area here and DNR sign. Just past this turn left onto a rough DNR  road  and
go .4 mile to a power line. Turn right and go 1.3  miles  to  a  switchback.
Drivable to  here  (and  possibly  beyond)  by  a  high  clearance  vehicle.
Continue on the road about .7  mile,  past  a  road  right,  to  a  spacious
switchback  just  beyond.  Marked  ATV  trail  intersects  here.  Take   the
switchback to just before an old mine  (about  .1  mile)  and  look  for  an
obscure blue flagged stake. Scramble up hillside through sticker  bushes  to
trail above. Follow trail about a mile to a washout gully. Find old road  on
other side. Follow road .2  mile  to  slightly  past  a  switchback  (ignore
flagging at switchback) to a spur left. Trail is a short ways up  this  spur
on the left (unmarked). Trail should lead all the way  to  lake  although  I
did run into some blowdowns and I couldn\'t find it  in  the  snow  near  the
lake. Despite heavy ORV/ATV/motorcycle use in the area below,  once  on  the
trail you leave them all behind and have a feeling of seclusion.  The  trail
is always within sound and sometimes sight of the rushing waters of May  Cr.
There are several nice camp sites at the lake that could be used as  a  base
for forays to more remote peaks in the vicinity.

Bald Mtn (4760+ ft - 680P - Silverton Quad) - January 30, 2009

I was so annoyed at missing Mike T and Matt\'s trip last week  up  Bald  (too
late communication) that I set out to rectify  that  situation  as  soon  as
possible. Mike\'s TR came in handy but  I  ended  up  having  very  different
conditions. Whereas they had rock hard crust and used crampons much  of  the
time, I had 8-10 inches of new snow higher up, and  I  approached  on  skis.
What a difference a few days makes.

Except for some washout areas with steep ups and downs and two rather  large
avalanches, all of which offered a few challenges on skis,  the  skiing  was
pretty good on the Deer Cr Road the 3.5 miles to the  switchback.  Expecting
hard crust, I had intended to stash the skis here and continue on  foot  the
rest of the way. But by this time there was enough new snow that I was  able
to stay on skis. In fact the skiing was  quite  nice  traversing  the  lower
basin, as was the first part of the  upper  basin  where  most  of  the  old
avalanches were covered and fairly smooth. I finally ditched the skis  where
the slope steepened considerably at about 3500 ft.

 Although the old slick crust underneath  caused  occasional  problems,  for
the most part step kicking worked well and crampons were  not  used.  I  did
however, veer too far to the right going up trying  to  stay  in  the  trees
where the snow wasn\'t as deep, and soon  found  myself  stopped  by  a  deep
gully and cliffs. I had to work back left into the  open  and  up  partially
covered slabs. I hit the south ridge at 4400 ft. A  short  section  of  easy
going was followed by tiptoeing along an ever narrowing ridge. With the  new
snow I had to be very careful to tread  carefully  as  it  was  not  obvious
where solid ground ended and hazardous cornice began. I soon came to the 10-
foot step down mentioned by Mike in his report. I was prepared  for  it  and
set up a short hand line leaving it in place for the return. It  might  have
been possible to down climb it but I felt better using the  rope.  A  little
more scrambling brought me to the narrow pointed  snow  ridge  of  a  summit
(3500 ft, 5:30 hrs), a very nice vantage  point  with  some  stunning  views
highlighted by storm clouds gathering around a sunlit White Chuck Mtn.

I didn\'t stay long on the summit. With my usual not-so-early  start  it  was
now  almost  4:00,  quite  windy  and  I  could  see  bad  weather   rapidly
approaching. Rain had been predicted for the evening  but  I  had  hoped  to
beat it out. I did not. The first drops hit as I was putting  my  skis  back
on and by the time I reached the road it was raining steadily. It  was  also
dark. If you discount the rain and the dark and the avalanches to  cross  it
was still a fun run down the road.

The wind must have been pretty darn strong down low also as I had  to  dodge
minor debris on the Mountain Loop Highway all the way to Granite Falls.

Total: 9.5 miles, 3600 ft and 9 hours.   Fay Pullen

Additional Note: Mike is correct in saying you only want to  do  this  route
when the avalanche danger  is  low.  Avalanches  are  common  off  the  many
cliffs, slabs and steep slopes on the approach through the lower  and  upper
basins. In fact I was getting a little nervous myself on  the  descent  from
the south ridge as I set off many snow wheels in the ever softening snow.  I
wouldn\'t have wanted much more fresh snow than I had.

Table Mtn (5742 ft - 422P - Shuksan Arm Quad) - February 3, 2009

I normally don\'t ski at Mt Baker in early winter due to the long  drive  and
short days, but I  was  dying  to  get  out  and  that  area  had  the  only
reasonable backcountry conditions on this day. My main goal  was  just  some
quality skiing, which I hadn\'t had for a while. My  secondary  goal  was  to
get up Table Mtn. I was able to accomplish both.

Heather Meadows is not open to downhill skiing during the week so the  upper
lots were virtually empty with just  a  handful  of  backcountry  travelers,
despite a 10:20 start. But since it is a 3.5 hour drive I really  left  home
fairly early for me. Immediately I was  in  heaven.  The  sun  was  shining,
everywhere I turned the views were spectacular and the snow  was  good  with
several inches of fresh from the day before. Since my main goal was  quality
skiing, I just headed where the touring looked good, wandering  from  Austin
Pass through delightful terrain on a low traverse to the far end of  Kulshan
Ridge (4694 ft - 54P) and then following that  ridge  up  and  over  Huntoon
Point (5247 ft - 167P) to Artist Point (5080+ - 0P).

Next on the agenda  was  Table  Mtn,  but  this  flat  topped  mountain  has
defenses on all sides. I remember having  to  give  up  on  it  from  Herman
Saddle years ago after skiing Mazama  Dome.  I  just  couldn\'t  see  how  to
penetrate the cliffs and I had never  been  back  for  a  second  try.  From
Artist Point the east face looked possible but when I got to the base of  it
was too steep and rocky for skis. I really wanted to  ski  to  the  top.   I
then tried traversing north to a break in the cliffs on the  east  side  but
again it got too steep for me. There was still time  left  in  the  day  and
Ptarmigan Ridge looked inviting so I decided to tour to the Ptarmigan Ridge-
Table Mtn Saddle and see if a route existed on the west side. It was  really
just an excuse to go where I had never been before.

I descended several hundred feet to the slopes south of Table. Once down  in
the basin the terrain is very nice but I sure wouldn\'t want to be here  with
high avalanche danger. I crossed  several  old  avalanches  and  even  today
snowballs were rolling off the cliffs in the filtered sunshine. I worked  my
way back up to the ridge just south of the summit where a direct snow  route
looked possible but challenging on  skis.  Instead  I  elected  to  continue
traversing north to a break on the west side that led easily  to  the  lower
plateau of the mountain. I thought I had it  made  until  I  saw  the  upper
plateau was guarded by a short snow wall topped by a  cornice.  I  tried  an
end run clockwise around the wall and cornice but was  stopped  by  a  steep
exposed slope. There was no other alternative but to leave  my  skis  behind
and climb  through  the  cornice.  I  wasn\'t  really  prepared  for  serious
climbing but I did have my wimpy tiny aluminum ice  axe  along,  the  one  I
take when I don\'t think I will need it. I  kicked  steps  up  the  wall  and
chopped my way through the cornice. It was really quite fun. The summit  was
at the west end of the flat upper plateau near some trees.

I had some decent skiing on the way  back.  Although  some  of  the  steeper
slopes exposed to earlier sun were beginning to ice  up,  more  gentle  ones
and those with a more northerly exposure remained powder snow.  I  did  beat
darkness back to the car but mine was the last one left in the lot.

I have always been very interested in the Olympics  and  in  the  past  have
made countless trips there. However, in recent years I have sadly  neglected
them while I pursued all things in the Cascades.  This  will  no  doubt  now
change. Three new peak lists have sparked renewed  interest  and  incentive,
the 100 Highest Olympic Peaks complied by Paul Klenke, and the  Rain  Forest
and Rain Shadow Courts complied by Jeremy Schmidt. All three are  posted  on
summitpost. So as I was perusing the Rain Shadow Court I saw  several  peaks
that could be skied from The Hurricane Ridge Road this time  of  year.  What
could be better than to combine  my  two  great  passions,  peakbagging  and
backcountry skiing?

The Hurricane Ridge Road is the only road in the Olympics kept open  to  the
high country in the winter, but it does have its restrictions.  It  is  only
open Friday-Sunday (and most holidays), the  gate  at  Heart  O\'  the  Hills
doesn\'t open until 9 am and is closed and locked every  night  at  dusk  (30
minutes after sunset), the only overnight parking is 3 miles down  from  the
Ridge and those going on tours are required  to  sign  in  and  out  at  the
lodge. This limits what can be done in a day - particularly  for  me.  There
can be no coming out after dark.

Since I have a major dislike of crowds I chose Friday  as  the  day  to  go,
despite forecasted precipitation. I had light rain  much  of  the  drive  to
Port Angeles, which I hoped would translate to fresh snow on the  Ridge.  It
did but only 1.5 inches at most. In fact I was rather shocked at  the  scant
snowpack in general at the 5200 ft road end. It had the appearance  of  much
recent rain and sun melting leaving behind an icy crust  barely  covered  by
the new snow. In places meadow plants were still visible. Never having  been
here before in the winter I don\'t know if this is normal.  I  do  know  that
the area is well known for fierce sudden storms and winds (hence  the  name)
that can scour fresh snow away, but maybe  it  is  also  really  in  a  rain
shadow. Darn! Well I was here and would just have to make  the  best  of  it
but the prospects for great skiing this day were  looking  dismal.  However,
it turned out not to be all that bad.

I began on the summer road to Obstruction Point right from the  parking  lot
that drops over 200 ft immediately on a steep open sidehill.  With  the  icy
crust under the minimal fresh snow this  section  was  challenging  and  did
nothing to change my opinion that the skiing was going to  be  lousy  today.
There is an alternate start to the Obstruction Point Road beginning  from  Â½
mile back down the Hurricane Ridge Road that avoids  this  sidehill,  though
not the descent. In retrospect I  should  have  taken  it.  Once  past  that
things began looking up as the road moderated in forest and snow  conditions
improved. The road descended another 200 feet  before  beginning  a  gradual
ascent to below Steeple Rock. Then an almost level couple of miles made  for
very nice skiing indeed. At Waterhole, the road tilted  upward  and  climbed
800 ft with two switchbacks. Below the south saddle of Eagle  Point  I  left
the road at 5800 ft to climb directly up steep open slopes to the ridge  and
followed it past some interesting rocks to the summit (6 miles, 1660  ft,  3
hrs). Snow cover was very thin on the final part.

The weather was constantly changing, from fog to  snow  showers  to  sun  to
spectacular cloud formations to tantalizing partial views. It couldn\'t  seem
to make up its mind what it wanted to do but it was never dull. I had to  be
fast with the camera because what views I did have would  quickly  come  and
go. The run back to Waterhole was  much  better  than  expected.  With  more
fresh snow there would have been all manner of  crosscountry  possibilities.
As it was I did a lot of slideslipping to the road, but the road itself  was
actually fun. The snow seemed to be softening up a bit and was not  terribly
fast. Once past Waterhole and Pt 5602, I left the road to climb easy  slopes
to the summit of Hurricane Ridge (9 miles, 2300 ft, 5 hrs).   I  found  some
very nice touring terrain on the way up. On  top  clouds  parted  enough  to
catch glimpses of Steeple Rock and Rocky Peak (both on my yet to  do  list),
the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Eagle Point.

Once back to the road I enjoyed the skiing the rest of the way  to  my  car.
Even the steep final sidehill wasn\'t bad going up. I did  have  to  turn  on
the speed, though, to keep my stated 5:00 return time. I made  it  at  4:50,
the last to sign in, and to the gate at 5:30.

So maybe my conditions weren\'t the best on this  tour,  but  they  ended  up
being reasonable and fun anyway. You just can\'t always hit it  right,  as  I
had 3 days earlier at Mt Baker, although I sure keep trying. I have come  to
the conclusion that in Western  Washington  lousy  backcountry  skiing  snow
conditions are the norm and good  conditions  are  the  aberration.  If  you
always go expecting this to be the case  you  will  never  be  disappointed.
You can only be pleasantly surprised.

Total: 12 miles, 2900 ft and 6:30 hrs.

Red Rock Mtn (4320+ ft - 600P - Grandy Lake Quad) - February 10, 2009

This makes for a splendid ski tour with roads going all the way to  the  top
and possibilities for crosscountry exploration as well. The only  caveat  is
that the snow level must be very low, as I had on Tuesday, to avoid  walking
the lower portion as the road is gated at 800 feet right off the Baker  Lake
Road. It can be done in bad  weather  and  has  no  avalanche  danger.   For
variety I skied along the south ridge a short ways on the way out. The  snow
was excellent.

Total: 12.4 miles, 4000 ft and 8 hours.

P.S. It would be a very boring snow shoe trip.

Mt Herman (6240+ ft - 1120P - Shuksan Arm Quad) - February 12, 2009

I sure underestimated this peak. I was just out for a great day  of  skiing,
planning on going to Herman Saddle and down to Chain Lakes and maybe see  if
I could ski up Barometer Mtn when I realized I was only Â½ mile away from  Mt
Herman. How long could it take to pop up that peak on a slight  detour?  How
about the rest of the day! It really shouldn\'t have taken that long, but  as
I said I was just out for some skiing and wasn\'t planning on a  real  climb.
I had no crampons (they are almost impossible to fit to  Nordic  boots)  and
no panic rope. I did at least have my wimpy ice axe.

I did very well for me and despite the long drive got started  at  9:00  am.
It was so cloudy and foggy to start, I wasn\'t sure I was going  to  get  any
views. But as I climbed toward Herman Saddle both  sun  and  views  appeared
intermittently. It never cleared completely though. In fact I think the  sun
coming out at my moment of decision to try for Herman lured me  on.  It  was
just too beautiful at that point not to go higher. However, I didn\'t get  as
high on my skis as I had hoped. Although  there  was  very  nice  powder  in
protected areas, it had not snowed for a day or so and  yesterday  had  been
sunny followed by a cold night. Steep slopes with a  southern  exposure  had
turned quite icy and they never softened. I left my skis at  about  5700  ft
and headed up on foot toward a high saddle in the ridge with Mazama Dome.  I
was barely able to kick reasonable steps up this section.

At the saddle a softer slope bypassed a rocky point  on  the  west  side  to
another saddle where an easy slope bypassed Point 6040 on the east.  Here  I
made a big mistake. Not wanting to drop a fair distance  under  cliffs  only
to climb again to Herman\'s south notch, I tried a straight  traverse,  found
it too steep and ended  up  climbing  to  the  ridge  above  the  notch  and
following it down. Do not go this way. It is better to  drop.  Once  at  the
notch I followed it to the steep south  ridge.  I  climbed  50  feet  or  so
before running into icy conditions that my Nordic (duckbilled)  boots  could
not kick a dent in. With climbing boots and crampons I could have  scampered
directly up.

Not giving up easily I looked for an alternative and on  the  map  the  east
ridge looked more gentle and would have, I hoped, softer snow. So I  made  a
long traverse under all the cliffs to this ridge. The snow WAS softer and  I
WAS able to kick steps but I wouldn\'t say it was less steep. This ridge  has
many ups and  downs  with  several  steep  rocky  and  snowy  steps  and  is
frightfully corniced and exposed. But it did go, although  the  difficulties
and uncertainty never quit right up to the end. And it was very  interesting
and exciting. I left my skis at 11:00 and reached the summit at  2:00  (2600
ft, 5 hrs), 3 hours to go less than half a mile.

I reversed my route on the east ridge. It wasn\'t as bad  as  I  had  feared,
just slow. If I had had a rope I could have descended  the  south  ridge.  I
dropped into the basin below the south  notch  to  avoid  the  traverse  and
climbed up to regain my tracks out. A much better way to go.  I  was  at  my
skis at 3:20 for a great ski down once I was off the icy slope. Chain  Lakes
and Barometer Mtn would have to wait for another trip.

Total: 6 miles, 3100 ft and 8 hours

Barometer Mtn (5763 ft - 1043P - Shuksan Arm Quad) - February 17, 2009

Another 9 am start from Mt Baker. Am I turning over a new leaf and  becoming
a habitual early riser or what? Good thing I did get going at  a  reasonable
hour as this trip turned out to take longer than I expected. There  were  no
real problems (well, except maybe the descent  from  Herman  Saddle  on  the
return) but it is farther than it appears on the map with a lot of  ins  and
outs and ups and downs.

I was at Herman Saddle in an hour and a half. From the  Saddle  I  descended
500 feet, with very nice skiing, to Hayes Lake from where I climbed a  small
spur ridge only to descend on the other side into a small  basin.  This  was
followed by a rising traverse through woods until it was possible to  access
the SE ridge of Barometer. Once on  the  ridge  proper  there  were  several
bumps to go over. The snow was quite good to this point with 4-6  inches  of
fresh that started the day as powder  but  was  rapidly  deteriorating  with
rising temperatures. What was going on here? I thought the  snow  level  was
supposed to be 2000 ft. Obviously it wasn\'t. I checked  my  thermometer  and
it was already  37  degrees.  Darn.  This  gave  me  some  concern  for  the
stability of the snow and I was already noticing  a  tendency  for  the  top
layer to slide on the old crust on steeper traverses.

At about 5300 feet the ridge crest became  narrow  and  somewhat  rocky.  In
order to continue on skis I would have to drop slightly and  traverse  steep
slopes, something not advisable under the conditions. So I left my skis  and
continued on foot. Remembering the icy conditions on Mt  Herman  last  week,
this time I had crampons along (I had since found  ones  at  Marmot  with  a
very large front bail that would fit my  skis  boots).  Naturally  I  didn\'t
need them. I didn\'t even need my ice ax. A little before 2:00 I pulled  onto
the spacious summit (2500 ft, 4:45 hr). It was starting  to  snow  and  cool
off.

I skied down the ridge before it cooled enough to ice  everything  over  but
the snow became very sticky. It was so sticky I was able to  climb  back  to
Herman Saddle without putting skins on.  By  then  the  weather  had  really
turned. It was now cold enough for the snow to begin to crust over.  Add  to
this the fact that it was also so foggy the only thing I  could  really  see
were my ski tips and the resulting skiing was less than  bad.  Getting  down
to Bagley Lakes was not a pretty picture. I did, however, have a  very  nice
final mile zipping along the smooth flat track to the car.

Total: 8 miles, 3500 ft and 8:45 hrs.

Big Four Mountain Attempt (6160+ ft - 1080P -  Silverton  Quad)  -  February
21, 2009

Mike T, Jim, Matt and I made a serious attempt  on  Big  Four  Saturday.  We
knew from the get go that the chances of summiting were slim.  The  freezing
level was much too high at 7000  ft.   Emails  flurried  back  and  forth  -
should we or shouldn\'t we go? We really shouldn\'t! We went anyway.  I  think
we needed to touch the mountain and see for ourselves and we knew that  with
the predicted new snow all the next week the mountain probably  wouldn\'t  be
in condition again for another month.

Mike had scouted the route a few weeks previously so we knew  exactly  where
to go. We hiked 2 miles from the end of the plowed  road  to  the  Big  Four
Picnic Area, crossed the river on a log next to the  washed  out  bridge  to
the Ice Caves, paralleled the river upstream 1 long mile to  the  Dry  Creek
basin and climbed through the lower cliff band via a hidden  gulley  to  the
upper basin. All this took about 4 hours and up to this  point  things  were
not looking all that bad. It was fairly warm but there  was  not  much  snow
left on the cliffs to come down and step kicking was good. It  was  when  we
reached the upper basin and needed snowshoes in the increasingly  deep  snow
that we began to see the handwriting on the wall. By the  time  we  were  at
the base of the summit couloir at 11:00 and 4500 ft  we  were  wallowing  in
knee deep snow.  That is as high as we got. It was difficult to turn  around
in such good weather with the summit beckoning and much of the day left  but
there was really no other choice.

Just to make sure, Jim dug a snow pit. As  he  dug  deeper  and  deeper  and
deeper without hitting a crust I got more and more freaked. Finally about  5
feet down he hit the crust. Above that  was  all  unconsolidated  snow  with
several very unstable sugary layers.  After seeing that I couldn\'t  get  out
of there fast enough. Oddly enough, what we were originally worried about  -
warm temperatures and debris coming down from  above  -  was  not  the  main
problem. The main problem was the deep  unstable  snow  underfoot  and  even
cold temperatures would not have changed that. Why all  this  snow  did  not
consolidate over  the  past  several  weeks  of  little  snowfall  and  much
sunshine I am not sure. I guess it is a combination of  this  couloir  never
seeing the sun all winter long and the north side of Big Four having  unique
weather and conditions. All I know is  the  expected  conditions  of  a  few
inches of soft snow on a hard crust that I have  been  running  into  on  my
recent tours did not materialize.

I have always been intimidated by Big Four and  this  trip  did  nothing  to
diminish that feeling. The climbing itself, up to where we  got,  is  pretty
straight forward and not really very difficult. It is the objective  dangers
of avalanches that are the problem. It is one impressive scary  mountain.  I
do not, however, regret our decision to go. I couldn\'t have gone with  three
greater guys and I got to touch the mountain  up  close  and  personal.  You
don\'t  always  have  to  make  the  summit  to  have  a  memorable  mountain
experience.

Total: to high point of 4500 ft - 9 miles, 3000 ft and 9 hours

Goat Mtn (4778 ft - 778P - Grandy Lake Quad) - February 27, 2009

This is a companion tour to the one I did a couple of weeks ago up Red  Rock
Mtn, on the other side of Grandy Cr. I was  waiting  for  another  low  snow
level to be able to ski the low elevation gated access road.  I  had  it  on
Thursday when Seattle and Bellevue got snow but traffic was  so  snarled  on
405 that morning it kept me home. I went Friday instead. Unfortunately,  the
Baker Lake area didn\'t get as much snow as I hoped and much of what  it  did
get had already melted off the lower road so I had to walk 2 miles  to  1880
ft to start skiing. It was totally worth the  walk.  Once  high  enough  the
snow was delicious powder the  rest  of  the  way  and  made  for  wonderful
skiing.  I followed the road to a clearcut at 3500  ft  and  then  the  east
ridge to the summit.  Views  were  gorgeous  and  the  ski  down  absolutely
delightful. It just doesn\'t get any better than this.

Total: 12 miles, 4200 ft and 7:30 hrs

Round Mtn (5970 ft - 650P) and Twin Peaks (5920+ ft - 440P) -  Spiral  Butte
Quad - February 28, 2009

Back to back wonderful ski trips. I risk getting spoiled. I  did  this  tour
the day after Goat Mtn. Normally I like a day or two  to  recover  but  when
the snow is this good you have to take  advantage  of  it  while  it  lasts,
which often isn\'t long. Even one day can make a big difference.  Stefan  was
gracious enough to allow me to accompany him on his outing to White Pass  at
the last minute when I saw what he had planned could be  done  on  skis.  It
was a little more challenging than Goat but still very skiable.  Stefan,  of
course, was on snowshoes. We climbed up alongside the ski run to the  ridge.
At that point we left the hordes behind and saw no one else.   Stefan  stuck
to the ridge line the whole  way  going  up  and  over  two  bumps  while  I
contoured around both through delightful woods  before  gaining  the  ridge.
Even with his added elevation  gain  Stefan  went  faster  that  I  did.  No
surprise there. The 18" of fresh powder made for excellent skiing. Only  the
steep narrow section of Twin Peaks west ridge before it leveled  off  and  a
short bare spot where I had to remove skis  presented  any  difficulties  at
all. The run down to the Round saddle was to die for. I could do  no  wrong.
Mostly we both did our own  thing,  meeting  on  the  summits,  with  Stefan
always ahead. The only time I beat him was on the return run  down  the  ski
area.

Washington Monument (4826 ft - 786P - Baker Pass Quad) - March 6, 2009

This is the last of the trilogy of peaks, which also includes Goat  Mtn  and
Red Rock Mtn, approached from roads around Grandy Cr.  It  is  the  farthest
and most challenging to get to. When I learned of Paul Klenke\'s interest  in
this peak I was pleased to have him join me, especially when it  turned  out
he was free on sunny Friday. He was on AT skis and I was on my  usual  light
touring gear.

Despite recent lowland snow around Seattle, there was  very  little  evident
in the Baker Lake area and we still had to walk the gated road  2  miles  to
the snowline at 1800 ft, the same as I did a week  earlier  when  I  climbed
Goat Mtn. We skied the road in several inches of  new  powder  another  3  Â¼
miles to the crossing of  Grandy  Cr.  Here  the  road  makes  a  very  long
switchback which we cut through tight  trees  to  hit  a  middle  spur  road
above. More open terrain led to the main road higher up. Another 2 miles  of
flat to slightly downhill road and then a final steeper spur  put  us  below
the NW ridge of the  Monument  where  we  left  our  skis.  We  ran  into  a
surprisingly slick crust under the new snow kicking steps up to  the  ridge.
Once on the ridge we were confronted by a final short but very  steep  pitch
that at first look seemed impossible to me.  Fortunately  Paul  was  unfazed
and proceeded up while I followed in his good steps. The  summit  was  roomy
but corniced (4500 ft, 6:15 hrs).

Once back to our skis we had a nice but short run down open  slopes  to  the
main road. To avoid some uphill on the road we contoured to the middle  spur
road then followed this to  its  intersection  with  the  main  road  again.
Neither one of us wanted to ski down through the tight trees  where  we  had
come up. The rest of the way was on variable conditions where Paul  had  the
edge on his AT skis. Protected areas were still powder and very nice.  Those
exposed to the sun and warming earlier had now frozen over. The worst was  a
mid section of deadly breakable crust that was very difficult  (for  me)  to
ski. Lower things improved to  consistent  crust  that  could  at  least  be
snowplowed. Still, by the time we reached the snowline I for  one  was  more
than ready to just plain walk. We reached the car before  complete  darkness
at 6:40.

Although the snow conditions were not as good for the downhill road  run  as
on my two previous trips (mainly because we came down too late) I  am  still
so impressed with this area that I am sure  I  will  return  just  for  many
skiing possibilities. I positively salivated over some of the terrain I  saw
but didn\'t have time to explore.

Total: 16 miles, 4700 ft and 10:20 hrs.

Stevens Ridge (5561 ft - 201P - Mt Rainier East Quad) - March 12, 2009

I have had my eye on Stevens Ridge for some time  as  a  possible  different
ski tour out of Paradise. It lived up to all my expectations. It  is  lovely
gentle touring terrain and is so far off the beaten  track  you  are  almost
guaranteed to have the whole place to yourself.  It  is  a  very  long  way,
however, if you make Point 5561, which is the greatest prominence  point  on
the ridge, your destination.  The  only  slight  difficulty  was  the  final
access to the ridge from the Stevens Creek basin which I took  too  high  to
avoid losing elevation and ran into a very  steep  slope.  I  took  a  lower
track on the way out which was better. The day was gorgeous  and  warm,  the
snow good and the views all around. I  did  leave  skis  just  before  Point
5648, as I ran into a combination of ice, melted  out  rocks  and  a  narrow
ridge, and continued easily on foot. The  connecting  ridge  to  Point  5561
made for a satisfying scramble goal.

Early in the day I was shaken a bit by a very  large  avalanche  coming  off
the Nisqually Glacier. But I was so far away it was of little concern.  Then
I was shaken even more late in the day when crossing a flat near Point  6252
where I felt a large area under me settle with a thump and  a  loud  report.
It sounded just like an explosive charge going off. I have had  flat  slopes
settle under me before but never such a large one and never so loud.  I  set
off several more incidents as I  cautiously  crossed  the  basin.  I  didn\'t
really feel all that threatened as the slope was gentle  but  it  was  still
rather disturbing and a reminder that  there  are  unstable  conditions  out
there.

Then as I was preparing to leave Paradise at the end of the day (I  was  the
last car), I was surprised to see an unfamiliar critter,  black  and  medium
dog sized, prowling the parking lot in the gathering darkness. He  was  wary
but didn\'t seem that afraid  either.  Maybe  he  is  the  resident  Paradise
mascot. When I got home I positively identified him  as  a  red  fox  (black
phase) by his bushy white tipped tail.

Gold Mtn (3400+ ft - 1360P - Helena Ridge Quad) - March 26, 2009

I knew I couldn\'t do anything more ambitious than a road ski  on  this  good
weather day, what with the recent dump of new snow and  the  high  avalanche
danger. Even on this low mountain above Darrington it took longer and I  had
to work harder breaking trail through more than a foot of heavy  fresh  snow
than I thought considering the elevation  gain  and  distance.  I  was  well
rewarded though with great views of the surrounding peaks  and  a  leisurely
lunch in the sunshine next to a weather station on the broad summit

Mt Higgins Quad 2 (3775 ft - 495P - Mt Higgins Quad) - March 29, 2009

More new snow and high avalanche danger once again kept me to a low peak.  I
had originally planned to ski up McGillicuddys Pk (4200+ ft). It had  looked
so simple on the map which showed roads going  all  the  way  to  top.  Even
Stefan\'s report from January 2007 indicated it was doable. But I knew I  was
in trouble when I reached the Mt Higgins TH.  The  road  was  abandoned  and
ditched right from the start and partially overgrown, the latter made  worse
by about 3 inches of fresh snow  that  caused  branches  to  bend  over  the
meager path and then drench me as I forced my through.  I  kept  hoping  the
road would get better. It didn\'t. Finally at the crossing of Rollins  Cr  (a
50 ft deep trench with no sign of the make ship bridge mentioned by  Stefan)
and with no prospect of making my  destination,  I  gave  up  on  the  road.
Seeking to salvage the  day,  I  forced  a  way  straight  uphill.  After  a
horrible steep section of tight trees, I emerged onto the plateau  north  of
Higgins2 where I found a series of better old roads and  more  open  terrain
leading nicely  to  that  summit.  There  were  even  a  few  limited  views
highlighted by  an  unfamiliar  attractive  low  peak  to  the  NW  I  later
identified as Big Deer. I skied down the Higgins2  road  as  no  way  was  I
returning the way I had come. I was  worried  how  this  would  be,  but  it
turned into a very nice continuous run down that road which was etched  into
the steep open hillside.

Total: 7 miles, 2500, and 7:30 hrs.

I was hard-pressed to find anywhere to  go  on  Wednesday  where  it  wasn\'t
raining.  Since all I really wanted to do  was  stretch  leg  muscles  still
sore from Stefan\'s Grasshopper climb and since I had always wanted to  check
out the Durr Road route to the North  Yakima  Rim  Trail,  this  seemed  the
perfect time to give that a try. Oh but the weather  was  nasty.  It  rained
heavily the whole way to Ellensburg though improved  a  bit  once  there.  I
found Durr Road to  be  quite  drivable  and  the  ford  across  Umtanum  Cr
manageable. Once on the ridge itself  vehicles  were  still  allowed,  so  I
drove the rough 4X4 roads in each direction as far as  I  felt  comfortable.
I wanted to get to the high point of Umtanum Ridge to the  west  and  (as  a
bonus) to Wenas BM to the east.  The farther one  got  from  Durr  Road  the
worse the roads became and in some places were quite  rough  and  muddy.  It
was raining lightly but very windy for both hikes. At least it  seemed  like
light rain. It must have rained harder than I thought  because  as  I  drove
down Durr Road at the end of the day I hit a section that  had  turned  into
gumbo mud that completely clogged my tires giving  me  zero  traction.  Much
worse than anything on the 4X4 roads up top.  I  slip-slided  down,  inching
along in low-low gear at 1 mph until I hit better  gravel.  Scary!  It  sure
wasn\'t that bad going up.

Umtanum Ridge: 6.5 miles, 1300 ft and 2:45 hr

Pickhandle Point (6361 ft) and Crown Point (6480+ ft) Ski Tour - Norse  Peak
Quad - April 16, 2009

I wanted some quality skiing close to home and this tour  fit  the  bill.  I
also explored some new territory.  I have skied  up  Pickhandle  Point  many
times but never from Pickhandle Gap,  only  from  Bear  Gap  and  Pickhandle
Ridge.

Starting from Lot C, I followed the cat tracks to the top of the Gold  Hills
Lift (closed for the season). From here it is best to pass  the  steep  step
into Pickhandle Basin through open woods right  of  the  draining  gully.  I
like this whole area as its sees little traffic and I usually  have  it  all
to myself. Most backcountry skiers go to  either  Silver  Basin  or  Bullion
Basin. From Pickhandle Gap I traversed lovely terrain, though  a  tad  steep
at the top, to Pickhandle Point and lunch. The day was young, the snow  good
and the terrain called me on to Gold Hill Ridge, where I had never  been.  I
returned over Crown Point  for  a  very  pleasant  loop.  Snow  varied  from
preserved powder in protected areas to a couple inches of melting  slush  in
the sun but both made for very good skiing. I  was  down  before  the  slush
froze to breakable crust.

Long Mtn East Peak (4760+ ft - 200P - Silverton Quad) - April 21, 2009

When I climbed Bald Mtn in January I spied a possible ski route up the  East
Peak of Long Mtn from the upper basin and took this gorgeous  sunny  day  to
see if it would actually go. I ran into three short steep  areas  that  gave
some trouble on skis but for the most part it is a very viable  route  under
the right snow conditions and I was able to ski all the way to the summit.

The Deer Creek Road is beginning to melt  out  and  won\'t  be  skiable  much
longer, but I only had to remove my skis for one  short  bare  section  past
the Devils Pk road junction.  I  left  the  road  after  3.5  miles  at  the
switchback at 2834 ft. I took the traverse across the lower basin quite  low
to avoid most of the plentiful avalanche debris. The day was warm and  sunny
and the snow already wet and slushy but most of what would  have  come  down
had already done so during the preceeding warm and sunny  days,  although  I
did hear and see a few minor rumbles.  Also  the  surface  slush  got  quite
unstable as the day went on and it was very easy to set off small sluffs  on
steep terrain, even in the trees. Nothing serious but it did make  me  worry
about losing my edges and taking a slide downhill.

A short steep step beside a gushing waterfall put me into  the  upper  basin
where  skiing  was  very  nice.  Unfortunately,  this  basin  ended  in   an
impassible headwall and I had to struggle up another slightly  longer  steep
section to gain the gentle ridge on the left. More good skiing until  I  hit
cliffs and had to traverse left and slightly downhill past a  gully  to  the
last steep section and gentler slopes above. The rest of the way  was  quite
pleasant, always in the constantly changing  view  of  the  very  impressive
Viking  Horns.  Although  I  had  expected  that  it  might  give  me   some
difficulty, I had no trouble accessing the summit Ridge or following  it  to
the flat summit and marvelous 360 degree views (3400 ft, 5:15 hrs).

By the time I skied down, the snow was very wet and  heavy  but  the  skiing
wasn\'t really that bad. I managed a few turns here  and  there,  but  I  did
take my skis off for all three  steep  steps.  It  seemed  faster  and  more
prudent to do so. The run down the road  was  pleasant  enough,  though  not
overly fast, and a nice end to very enjoyable ski trip.

Total: 12 miles, 3500 ft and 8:15 hrs.

Hurricane Hill (5757 ft - 707P - Hurricane Hill Quad) and Griff  Peak  (5120

With the Hood Canal Bridge closing for 6 weeks on May 1,  this  weekend  was
my last chance to ski to Hurricane Hill this  season.  Friday  was  forecast
sunny and clear but cold. After the slushy  conditions  of  earlier  in  the
week I fully expected crusty snow conditions  but  they  turned  out  to  be
downright icy. I ended up doing almost a third  of  the  trip  on  foot  and
could have used crampons, which for  some  inexplicable  reason  I  did  not
take.

I was the first to sign out at the Hurricane  Ridge  Lodge  at  9:30  AM.  I
began by skiing the 1.5 miles to the  end  of  the  road  that  goes  toward
Hurricane Hill, zipping along since it went mostly downhill. Fortunately  it
was very gentle. Leaving the road, I started along the  summer  trail  until
soon confronted by a  large  Park  sign  warning,  "Steep  and  Icy"  as  it
traversed around a minor bump in the ridge. Yikes! I wasn\'t expecting  this.
Although exposed to the sun, it was too early in the day  for  the  snow  to
have softened and I could not make it safely across without crampons.  So  I
climbed to the top of the ridge and did a bypass over the bump. Once on  the
ridge I could ski again, traversing less icy slopes into the wide  beautiful
basin south of Hurricane Hill. An easy ascent up open slopes put me  on  top
(3 miles, 1100 ft, 1:45 hrs) where I had great  views.  I  was  particularly
drawn to rocky Unicorn Peak and Horn.

To get to Griff Pk, my next objective, I had to descent some 1200  feet  off
the north side of Hurricane Hill. This would ordinarily be a great run,  but
with the icy conditions I found it unskiable and instead kicked steps  down.
It really killed me not to be able to ski  these  lovely  slopes.  Following
the easiest terrain, I ended up a bit low  on  the  traverse  to  the  Griff
Saddle. Above the saddle I was once again on sunny south facing  slopes  and
I skied easily up, despite having to thread through the charred trees of  an
old burn, to the wooded summit of Griff Peak (5 miles, 2000 ft, 3:45 hr).

By now the south slope of Griff was soft enough for reasonable skiing  down.
At the saddle I continued  on  skis  trying  a  higher  line  but  was  soon
compelled by cliffs and steep terrain to descend to  my  original  route.  I
kept my skis on as long as possible, but once in the North Basin  again  the
snow was still so icy I was forced to kick steps. Near the top of the  ridge
I ran into fresh ski tracks which had traversed out  into  the  North  Basin
only to dead-end at a line of steps kicked back up to the  ridge.  So  these
skiers had also judged it unskiable and had retreated.  That  made  me  feel
better and not so much of a wimp.

I had a marvelous ski down the sunny south  slope  and  basin  of  Hurricane
Hill and ran into many other skiers doing the same. Conditions  in  the  sun
were excellent, those in the shade never softened all day. I ran  into  even
more skiers and walkers (snowshoes were not necessary) farther on,  most  of
whom didn\'t go much beyond the end of the road, even though the  "Steep  and
Icy" trail traverse was now soft enough to cross.

Total: 10 miles, 3700 ft, 7 hrs.

I had to check out my cabin near  Chelan  in  preparation  for  an  imminent
family visit and on the way I had this very nice ski tour. Mission Ridge  is
close for the season and I had the runs all to myself. There was  about  4-6
inches of new snow, with more being added as the day  went  on,  which  made
for excellent skiing. Naneum Ridge between Wenatchee Mtn  and  Naneum  Point
was especially pleasant as long as I stayed off the  very  crest  which  had
been scoured down to crampon requiring ice. It snow lightly  to  began,  was
quite windy along the ridge and by the time I came the weather  deteriorated
to almost blizzard conditions. It was snowing and  blowing  so  hard  I  had
trouble seeing where I was going. This was one of the few times I found  the
weather on the east side worse than on the west side.

Total: 7 miles, 2600 ft and 5:20 hrs.

Klahane Ridge (6046 ft - 166P - Mt Angeles Quad) - April 30, 2009

I couldn\'t resist one last visit to the  Hurricane  Ridge  area  before  the
Hood Canal Bridge closes for 6 weeks. Crossing the bridge mere hours  before
the closure scheduled for May 1  at  12:01  AM  I  counted  5  barge  cranes
hovering close by ready to start work. I had hoped to climb  Rocky  Peak  or
least scout it out on this trip. But as I approached Port  Angeles  I  could
see there was too much new snow on the higher peaks  to  make  this  serious
rock scramble a reasonable prospect. I would have to  be  satisfied  with  a
lesser objective.

This being a Thursday, as expected, the Hurricane Ridge Road was  closed  so
I made my approach from the Lake Angeles Trail just before the gate.  I  had
never been up this trail before. It is in great shape and snow free to  just
before the 4200 ft lake. Above that the trail  was  completely  under  snow,
hard to follow and crosses downright dangerous terrain. I didn\'t  expect  it
to be so difficult. It took me 2 hours to go the 3.7 miles and 2300 feet  to
the lake but another 2 hours to find my way the next 1000 feet  past  cliffs
to easier terrain above. It appears from the map you might be able  to  just
climb the rib west of the lake. You cannot. It is too craggy and  rocky.   I
was able to find the trail as it crossed the  rib  to  the  west  and  began
traversing but soon lost it in deep snow. Without the help of a trail I  was
at a loss as to where to cross back to the east side. I  ended  up  on  very
steep sidehill through cliffy terrain that was not  helped  at  all  by  6-8
inches of unconsolidated new snow over a slick  crust.  After  a  couple  of
wrong detours I eventually found the correct crossing at 5200 ft.

Then it was all worth it. The terrain below Klahane Ridge  is  gorgeous.  Oh
how I wish I had my skis. Skiing would have been superb,  but  there  is  no
way I could have carried skis up. Views were fantastic. I  saw  several  eye
catching peaks that will warrant future trips. I never even  heard  of  Peak
5550, but this flat topped cliffy peak  is  most  impressive  as  it  towers
directly east of Lake Angeles. Locals call it Burnt Mtn  although  the  USGS
map places that name on a lesser 4910  ft  summit  farther  east.  Both  the
Middle Peak of Mt Angeles and Second Top also look to be worthy climbs.  And
then of course there is Rocky Peak, which has intrigued me  for  some  time.
It does not look any too easy.  I  will  have  to  try  again  under  easier
conditions and when I can make  the  shorter  approach  from  the  Hurricane
Ridge Road.

Total: 10 miles, 4500 ft and 8:20 hours

Davis Pk (7051 ft - 1771P - Diablo Dam Quad) - May 9, 2009

Davis is an impressive peak that towers some 6000 feet directly above  Gorge
Lake to the north. I have been tantalized by views of it every time I  drive
home along the North Cascades Highway and finally got my chance to climb  it
on this great trip organized by Paul Klenke. Joining  were  Mike  T.,  Matt,
Martin, Carla, Tisha, Grant, Don Brooks and his son Scott, for  a  total  of
ten people. This made for a very  strong  party  that  I  had  a  hard  time
keeping up with. Then again I didn\'t have to carry any  ropes  or  kick  any
steps.

We started at 8:00 from the Gorge Falls  parking  lot,  crossed  the  bridge
over Gorge Cr and immediately  thereafter  went  straight  uphill  into  the
woods. There was a semi "trail" to start through the light brush and  sallal
but it soon disappeared. Several cliff bands had to be bypassed  but  mostly
we stayed closely east of a  minor  gully.  The  going  was  steep  but  not
difficult nor terribly brushy. It was actually much better  than  I  thought
it would be. Somewhere around 3700 ft we hit snow in  a  shallow  gully  and
travel eased as we made our way onto the south ridge.  At  a  lovely  scenic
flat spot on the ridge at 5500 ft we took a well deserved rest (4400  ft,  4
hrs).

We then followed the ridge to Pt 5872. There was a little steep bit off  the
other side where we put in a short rappel. Once down we saw an easier  route
that we climbed on the way back. Then we were confronted by the 300 ft  rock
step gaining the main summit ridge. It  appeared  rather  intimidating  from
afar. We scrambled up the first 100 feet of snow covered wet rock  and  dirt
to a belay tree, where we set up running belays  on  our  2  60m  ropes  the
final 200 feet of steep snow to the ridge. This ate up some  time.  Once  on
the ridge it was a lovely walk along a beautifully  corniced  ridge  to  the
summit at 3:20 (6300 ft, 7:20 hrs).

We did two rappels down the rock  step,  one  double  and  one  single  rope
length. Again, with 10 people this took time, about an hour per rappel.  For
Tisha this was her first mountain  rappel.  Nothing  like  being  forced  to
"swim or sink", but she did fine. And it was fun seeing a  whole  new  world
of experience being opened to someone for the first time.  By  the  time  we
were back to Pt 5872 and started down it was 6:00. The descent went  rapidly
helped immensely by a wonderful glissade 2000 ft down the  snow  gully,  one
of the best I have had in years. We reached the cars at 8:15.

This was a great group of climbers.  I wish I  could  properly  credit  each
one for their contributions but I was usually trailing so far  behind  I  am
not sure who did what. All I know is that they all worked together  to  make
this a successful climb.

As a side note, all afternoon  weather  threatened.  As  times  it  appeared
almost certain we would be rained on as black clouds formed all  around  us,
but we were spared. We stayed mostly  in  the  sun  with  good  near  views.
Avalanche danger was high and we saw and heard several  avalanches,  but  we
were relatively safe on our  ridge  route.  We  nixed  the  SW  basin  route
because of the danger.

Gear: 2 60m ropes, 4 pickets, light rack, harness, crampons (did  not  use),
ice axe

Friday - After 2 weeks of relative inactivity (i.e. no peakbagging) with  my
family I was dying to get out. With the promise of a long  stretch  of  good
weather I opted for the first overnight of the year, but finding a  suitable
2-day trip was a challenge. I needed  something  fairly  easy  that  had  TH
access and no major creek crossings without bridges. With the  warm  weather
and recent snows all rivers were in spate. Fortunately I was able  to  drive
all the way to the White River TH and both the bridges over the White  River
and Indian Creek were intact. But I ran into snow  patches  from  the  start
and the melting made  for  a  soggy  wet  trail  with  many  detours  around
puddles. I also barely made it across  the  usually  minor  creek  about  .5
miles in by rock hopping. It was noticeably higher the next day on  the  way
out and I wasn\'t as lucky. I ended up wading  with  boots  on  which  didn\'t
really matter as by that time my feet were soaked anyway.

What with detours, inconsistent  snow  and  the  odd  downed  tree,  not  to
mention not being in backpacking shape, it took me  3:20  hr  to  go  the  5
miles and barely 1000 ft to the creek draining Airplane Lake, where  I  left
the trail. Heading up along the east side of the creek and  once  above  the
solid snow of the valley, I was surprised to run into the remains of an  old
trail. It had the look of a built trail (as opposed  to  a  booted  or  game
trail) and was fairly good in places. I soon lost it in snow higher  up  but
I was able to follow it for about 500 feet of gain and it got me  through  a
lower minor cliff band. Does anyone have knowledge of  a  trail  ever  being
built to Airplane Lake? I did find some wire  and  cut  timber  on  Airplane
Peak. Maybe there was a lookout up there at one time.

Once I hit "solid" snow (about 4500 ft) I was slowed even more as  the  snow
was anything but solid. I postholed up slush, taking an additional  3  hours
to climb the added 2200 ft to Airplane Lake and my intended  campsite  (6  Â¼
miles, 3100 ft, 6:20 hrs).  I still wanted to climb  Airplane  Peak  but  it
was now 6:00 and the snow was so soft I wasn\'t sure I would have  time  even
though it was only a bit more than 1000 feet above me.   I  quickly  set  up
camp and started up at 6:30 stopping by the melted outlet  of  the  lake  to
fill my water bottles on the way. The snow was very soft but I made  the  RT
in 2 hours. I would have liked to have glissaded  on  the  way  down  but  I
didn\'t want to have my pants completely soaked for the night. I settled  for
fast plunge stepping down tracks made by minor slides set off by me.

Saturday - I had hoped to get an early start the next day to take  advantage
of the cold night (36 in my tent). I went to  bed  at  10:00  and  the  next
thing I knew it was 7:00 in the morning. Darn! I guess I was  tired.  But  I
paid dearly for my late start. By the time I got going  at  8:00,  the  snow
was already softening. It had never really frozen overnight except  to  form
a weak breakable crust - no real help at all.  And  the  higher  I  got  the
worse it was. Considering the snow conditions, I  opted  for  the  shortest,
most direct route I could find, which was straight up the  east  slope  from
my camp, in the sun from the moment it rose. I postholed calf and knee  deep
much of the way. It goes without  saying  snowshoes  would  have  been  very
useful but I had elected not  to  bring  them.  Where  I  could  I  went  up
avalanche snow which was more consolidated.

The summit was a miniature rock horn (1950 ft, 2 hrs). At the base  I  found
an interesting Mountaineer register dating back  to  1984  and  filled  with
entries of many I know. I must be almost the last of my circle  of  climbers
to climb this peak. Although on my list for years (maybe even  decades),  it
has taken me a while to get to it.  I  took  over  30  minutes  reading  the
register and enjoying the expansive views even as the  sun  beat  down  full
force and I felt pressure to leave as the snow softened by the minute. If  I
thought the snow was bad on the way up it was torture on  the  way  down.  I
couldn\'t even glissade even though I didn\'t  care  now  about  getting  wet.
When I sat down I just sank into a hole. And strangely, I couldn\'t  set  off
any slides to get rid of the top layer even though  the  upper  slopes  were
quite steep. I was forced to posthole and wallow downhill through  knee  and
thigh deep slush. I was actually worried about not being  able  to  make  it
out. These have to be  some  of  the  worse  snow  conditions  I  have  ever
encountered on foot.

I dragged into camp at noon, having taken as long to get down as to get  up,
with the lower half of me soaked and frozen. I stripped and crawled into  my
sleeping bag for a peaceful hour nap while my  clothes  dried  in  the  sun.
Peaceful, that is until a refrigerator sized block of snow came off a  cliff
above the lake (not on my route) setting off  a  small  avalanche.  Oddly  I
wasn\'t worried  about  avalanches  when  on  my  route  (I  felt  everything
unstable had already come down)  but  maybe  I  should  have  been.   I  was
actually more worried about being swallowed  up  by  bottomless  slush.  But
then there really isn\'t that much difference between the two is there?

By the time I packed up and left at 1:30 my pants had dried. My  boots  were
another matter. I did have dry socks but it didn\'t take  long  for  them  to
get soaked again. Wading the creek just  before  the  TH  didn\'t  make  much
difference. There were maybe a dozen cars at the TH by now.  Most  indicated
on the trail register to be either climbing Mt David or Clark Mtn. None  had
made it up Indian Creek past the creek crossing.

Total: 16 miles and 6500 ft in 2 days.

Independence Pk (5400+ ft - 1160P - Helena Ridge Quad) - May 28, 2009

This is a small but rocky peak just south of North Lake at the  end  of  the
Coal Cr Road off the Mountain Loop Highway. Beckey lists  the  elevation  as
5445 ft., the USGS map as 5400+ ft. When you can drive the road to  its  end
near Coal Lake it would be a short pleasant scramble.  Unfortunately  I  was
only able to drive the road 2 miles  before  being  stopped  by  a  wall  of
avalanche snow. I had brought skis in case I could ski the  road  but  there
was another 1.5 miles of bare road beyond  and  it  didn\'t  seem  worth  the
effort to carry them to ski the final 1 mile of snow-covered road.

I left the road past Coal Lake and climbed open easy  snow  slopes,  working
past the odd rocky gully and cliff to the west  ridge  saddle  at  5080  ft.
Here a wide ledge skirted the base of the cliff to the right going around  a
corner to a gully, mossy at the bottom, choked with cedar at the top,  which
provided access to the upper west ridge. Fun exposed  scrambling  along  the
crest on solid but lichen covered rock led to the summit at the far  end  of
the ridge  (3000  ft,  4:30  hrs).  I  found  a  pitiful  makeshift  plastic
container of a register that had completely deteriorated and an  older  film
can that had fared better. I left the  film  can  but  added  the  amazingly
still legible paper (after drying it in  the  warm  sun)  from  the  plastic
container to a new register of my own. I packed out the offending  crumbling
container.

Entries of interest I could read:  Earliest  10/30/83;  Grant  Meyer  1986?;
John Roper 7/21/90; Mitch Blanton 5/8/95; Jeff Howbert 8/3/02;  Fred  Beavon
9/27/06 and Don Beavon 9/29/06. I had fun trying to  read  all  the  scraps,
soaking up the sun and admiring the views for 45 minutes.

I did two rappels on the way down, one short one at a class 4  step  on  the
ridge and one the full length of my 100 ft rope to get  down  the  worst  of
the gully. The gully was mostly just class 3  but  it  was  mossy,  wet  and
slick. Then it was fast glissading and plunge stepping  down  soft  snow  to
the road.

Total: 8 miles, 3000 ft and 7:30 hrs

Frozen Mtn (5080+ ft - 920P - Mt Phelps Quad) - May 30, 2009

Frozen Mtn is a somewhat obscure rocky peak hidden deep in  the  Tolt  River
drainage and guarded by miles of gated logging  roads.  Its  main  claim  to
fame is being on the Home Court List. I had been putting off climbing it  as
I knew it would be a real combined effort of biking and brush  bashing.  But
with the impending closure of Forest Road 62 at  Highway  2  (thanks  Stefan
for the heads up), I figured it was now or  never.   With  an  additional  6
miles one way of gated road to bike that would essentially  put  it  out  of
reach as a day trip. It is long enough as is.

I began by biking the road from the current gate. About 4 miles in I  had  a
fairly good view of the route. The only information I had was  a  report  by
Mike Collins from June 7, 2002.  He approached via a road on the south  side
of the North Fork Tolt which entailed crossing that river before heading  up
the west slopes of Frozen. With all rivers running very high now, I  knew  I
wouldn\'t be able to cross the North  Fork  without  a  log,  and  finding  a
suitable log could be a real problem. From my viewpoint (and from  the  map)
I could see two old roads, an upper and lower, paralleling  the  North  Fork
on the north side that could possibly get me through  the  worse  brush  and
close to the west side of my peak. I could also see a fairly  new  clear-cut
along the lower road that should mean that road had been improved. But  when
I got to clear-cut I couldn\'t find the road. So  I  opted  to  try  the  old
upper road.

I left my bike at the start of the old upper road but was confronted  almost
immediately by a major creek washout. I crossed the devastation  and  picked
up the road on the other side but it was  very  old  and  overgrown.  Now  I
could look down on the clear-cut and I saw a good road traversing  it  so  I
dropped down to it. Where the heck did it come  from?  I  found  out  on  my
return that the start of this road had been completely  obliterated  by  the
same washout as above. I followed the clear-cut road to its end  at  another
creek. The old lower road continued on the other side but again it was  very
old and overgrown and I soon lost it in a swampy brushy area. For  the  next
several hours I floundered in awful brush.  I  crossed  several  creeks  not
shown on the map expecting each to be the major one draining the north  side
of Frozen. I had to be on the south side of this creek before I could  start
uphill. Somehow, forced by terrain and brush, I ended up  on  the  banks  of
the North Fork Tolt very near its intersection with  my  target  creek.  The
good news was that the creek was braided enough here I  could  cross  it  by
boulder hopping. The North Fork Tolt was another matter.  It  was  a  raging
torrent and no logs were in sight. No way could I have gotten across. I  had
more brush to contend with but at least I could now start uphill.

I slowly climbed upward at a snail\'s pace all the while  feeling  the  hours
slipping away. It had taken a good portion of the day just  to  get  to  the
base of my peak. I alternated between chucking the whole climb as  a  really
bad idea and totally hopeless and stubbornly continuing no matter  how  long
it took even if it meant a bivy. At some point the latter sentiment won  out
as it became clear to me if I didn\'t get this peak this day  I  most  likely
never would. I sure wasn\'t coming back. Eventually I got  above  the  valley
brush and things improved. Mostly I followed a rib to the right of my  creek
until it seemed prudent to traverse right into the drainage west of  Frozen.
Here I ran into snow and, finally, blessedly open and friendly  terrain.  It
sure was a long time coming.

I now had to figure out a way up the summit block. Frozen is  a  north-south
ridge with a series of rocky points. The high point is the one  second  from
the north, about 300 ft high. I made my way to the notch  on  the  north.  I
went through to examine the east side and all  I  saw  were  horribly  steep
open snow slopes and wet  mossy  slabs.  I  should  have  looked  closer.  I
thought the west side looked better. I was wrong. I  made  my  way  up  gosh
awful wet mixed snow and rock in a very steep treed gully.  I  think  I  was
lured by the false security I thought  being  able  to  hang  onto  branches
would give. But I sure didn\'t feel secure. I emerged onto  the  snowy  north
ridge with a sigh of relief. No way was I going to  downclimb  that  (I  did
have my 100 foot rope if all else failed).

The summit was a pleasant rocky point in the sun (4000 ft, 7:40 hrs) with  a
nice view of the not often seen south side of Mt Index. There  was  a  cairn
but I couldn\'t find a register. I left one of mine. I  speculated  when  the
next person would sign in. I guessed no time too soon. I did take  a  moment
to catch my breath, but I had a long way to go to get down and it was  still
a tossup if I would make it before dark.  I descended  the  north  ridge  on
the east side, the route I had nixed from the notch. It was quite steep  but
continuous snow  with  good  step  kicking  (which  I  did  facing  in)  and
infinitely better than the way I had ascended. All things are relative.

On the way down I wanted to cross the major  creek  higher  up  so  I  could
descend directly to the clear-cut road and avoid  the  worse  of  the  lower
valley brush, but the creek was in a gorge with waterfalls and running  very
high. I began worrying about just getting across it at all.  As  luck  would
have it, when I was forced into the creek by terrain  and  brush  I  hit  it
where a good log provided a convenient crossing. Fairly nice forest  on  the
other side lasted until I reached the old road. I managed to stick  with  it
through the swampy brushy area (where I lost it earlier in the day)  to  the
creek at the clear-cut. This creek was also running high by now but again  a
convenient, if spindly, log offered a dry foot crossing. All  that  remained
was to walk the road back to my bike. This is when I  discovered  the  start
of the clear-cut road had been obliterated  by  flood/avalanche  debris.   I
did make it to my car before dark but it was close.

I am thinking there ought to be a better approach to this peak. Certainly  I
made many errors in choice of route and yet I doubt any way  would  be  very
easy. Sometimes it is these little guys that give you the most trouble.

This is #98/100 on the Home Court for me. I  still  have  Bears  Breast  and
Middle Index to do. I think I can do Bears Breast. Middle Index I am not  so
sure.

Total: 17.5 miles, 4300 ft and 12:15 hours (12 miles, 1000 ft and  2.5  hrs
RT on bike)

4, 2009

Tucked between and somewhat dwarfed by higher Three Fingers  and  Whitehorse
Mtn, Mt Bullon is equally rugged and much more difficult to  access.  It  is
seldom climbed and hence has no beaten trail to  its  top.  A  trip  to  its
environs feels like a true wilderness experience. I have long had it  in  my
sights. There were also several lesser but interesting peaks nearby  that  I
wanted to include, hence 3 days seemed like the minimum time required.

Day 1 (Tuesday) - High Camp - The only route information I had was  that  in
Beckey and it was sparse indeed. I began  by  hiking  the  Squire  Cr  Trail
about 2.8 miles to 2000 ft and dropping  250  ft  through  brush  to  Squire
Creek. This was a hot day and I was worried about finding a crossing as  the
water was quite high. There are three braids of the creek here,  the  middle
being the main channel, and I had no trouble finding logs across  the  first
two. The third could be rock hopped. I then started uphill through light  to
moderate brushy forest until I hit a rock  wall  at  2600  ft.  I  traversed
northward at its base until I came to a creek partially  filled  with  snow.
This conveniently provided a crossing. I now had no definite idea of how  to
proceed but essentially was forced to climb up between  this  creek  on  the
left and another one on the right. The next 1000 feet were  horrible,  steep
and brushy where I soon found myself on a narrow rib sandwiched between  wet
slabs on the left and the gorge of a roaring creek on  the  right.  My  pace
was pitifully slow as I struggled upward through this section dripping  with
sweat in the enervating heat. When I hit continuous snow  (around  3700  ft)
and moderating slopes above the slabs I breathed a  sigh  of  relief.   With
each upward step views opened up. Finally, this is what I had  come  for.  I
found a flat spot on snow to camp at 4900 ft just below the notch  south  of
Pop Tart Tower on the Salish-Buckeye ridge (5 miles, 4000 ft and 7 hours).

Day 2(Wednesday) - Mt Bullen - I had positioned my camp with an eye to  what
might come off the ridge. I really thought most everything that  could  come
off already had, but just to make sure I  deliberately  pitched  my  tent  a
little lower and off to the side of the fall  line  than  my  first  choice.
Sure enough, while eating breakfast in my tent as  the  first  rays  of  the
intense morning sun hit the ridge I heard a frightening crash above  me  and
the unmistakable sound of a cornice falling. Too late to  make  any  evasive
action, I could only stick my head out of my tent  and  watch  incredulously
as ice chunks came crashing  down  very  near  my  original  thought  for  a
campsite.  That was a little too close for comfort.

The night was warm and the  snow  stayed  soft  for  good  step  kicking.  I
climbed the short distance to the 5240 ft notch above camp where  I  had  my
first view of Mt Bullon on the other side. It looked a  long  distance  away
and not all that straight forward. Beckey says it can be climbed in 2  hours
from the notch. I don\'t think so, at least not by the likes of me.  First  I
had to descend some 1000 feet to the basin north of Bullon  Lakes.  To  this
end I traversed NW almost all the way to the Bullon-Pk 5931 ridge  before  I
could see a way down through the cliff bands that surround the lakes. I  did
one short rappel down a slick wet gully (everything was wet and  melting  on
this very hot day) and scrambled some easy rock  before  hitting  the  lower
snow slopes. I traversed easy snow above the lakes to  pass  beneath  cliffs
and a waterfall creek at the low point before starting up again.

Now routefinding became a challenge. Beckey merely  says  to  climb  heather
and broken rock, all class 2, on the SE ridge. Well, the SE ridge is not  at
all an obvious feature and I wandered all  over  trying  to  find  an  easy,
preferably continuous snow, slope up. I failed. I contoured  beneath  cliffs
and past another nasty waterfall gully too far W  until  completely  stopped
by impassable terrain. Then I doubled back E and up. I would  find  a  short
snow slope that led up only to be blocked by cliffs above and I  would  have
to traverse E again. Several times I thought I was doomed but  each  time  I
would find a way past the difficulties and slowly I worked  my  way  upward.
After a particularly scary steep snow traverse  above  the  nasty  waterfall
gully, I finally broke out onto the upper gentler snow slopes. The last  bit
was indeed a scramble on heather and broken rock. I found  a  cairn  on  the
summit but no register (2100 ft, 4:45 hrs). I left one of mine.

What a glorious spot with Three Fingers to the south and Whitehorse  to  the
north. I stayed the better part of an hour eating lunch, soaking up the  sun
and drying out my boots. From the summit I could pick out a better route  on
continuous snow back to the Salish-Buckeye ridge and from there a way up  Pk
5931, next on the agenda. I also found a better  way  off  Bullon,  more  or
less straight down, that eliminated the scary traverse above the  waterfall.
I did run into some steep broken (and of course wet)  rock  where  I  almost
did a rappel but I found a scramble way down. Once back to my uphill  tracks
it was not at all obvious that was the way I should have  gone.  All  I  can
say is it is best to stay climber\'s  right  of  the  waterfall  gully  on  a
narrow rocky rib.

Peak 5931 - Using my better route seen from the summit of Bullon, I  climbed
up onto the SW slopes of Peak 5931. I went right past cute  Pop  Tart  Tower
then up steepening snow to the bouldery summit (3700 ft,  9  hrs).  I  found
neither register nor cairn and left both. I descended straight to the  notch
doing one rappel at a particularly steep and  rotten  snow  section  in  the
trees.

Salish Pk - I continued on past  camp  heading  for  Salish.  I  knew  if  I
stopped I wouldn\'t get going again and time was  running  out.  I  contoured
beneath Pt 5360 and gained the ridge S of there at 5280 ft to  climb  Salish
on its easy N slope (4600 ft, 11:40 hrs). Again there was  neither  a  cairn
nor a register but I didn\'t have another register with  me.  It  was  in  my
tent. I had a stunning view of the NE Buttress of Three Fingers but  it  was
too late in the day and Bullon was all shadows. I was back  in  camp  in  an
hour after a long but very satisfying day  (6  miles,  4700  ft,  12:40  hrs
total).

Day 3 (Thursday) - Buckeye Pk - Again the snow did not freeze.  If  anything
it was even warmer than the previous night. I started for Buckeye  at  8:00.
The approach was easy to the base of the E ridge.  Becky  says  to  climb  a
class 4 chimney to the E ridge and expect 200  feet  of  rock  climbing.  In
anticipation of this I  had  brought  a  minimal  rack  (left  at  camp  the
previous day) and a 100 ft rope. I never found the chimney but I did  see  a
fairly easy way onto the ridge via a snow finger. I roped  up  once  on  the
ridge but only because it was exposed, I was alone and I  wasn\'t  sure  what
difficulties I would run into. In retrospect,  from  where  I  accessed  the
ridge, the whole thing could be scrambled. There were a couple  of  class  4
moves but the holds were good. Most of the way was a very nice ledge. I  did
pass an old rappel sling just below the summit (1 mile, 950 ft,  2  hrs).  I
left a register in the cairn I found. I did do a rappel off  the  ridge  but
it could have been downclimbed.

I was back in camp by 11:30. I ate lunch then took a  glorious  hour  and  a
half relaxing and just enjoying  my  alpine  surroundings  (and  reading  my
favorite Nevada Barr book series).  I  was  reluctant  to  leave  especially
since I wasn\'t really looking forward to the descent. But  all  good  things
must come to an end and the bad is the price we pay for the good. I left  at
1:15. I was glad I had the route up marked on my GPS. There is  very  little
room for error on the way down. Get it wrong and you will end up  cliffbound
or trapped by gushing creek gorges. One  view  I  had  of  the  major  creek
draining the basin W of Squire Cr Wall was absolutely unreal. The  waterfall
appeared to shoot out a hundred feet into space there  was  so  much  water.
Anyway I nailed the down route. It was still unpleasant but not  as  bad  as
expected. I even came out right at my logs crossing  Squire  Creek.  It  was
only when I started up the last 250 feet to the trail that  I  realized  how
very tired I was. The brush seemed totally unreasonable and malicious and  I
could barely put one foot in front of  the  other.  Once  on  the  trail  it
seemed like heaven in comparison. I reached my car at 6:15 (5 hrs).

Rocky Pk (6218 ft - 498P - Mt Angeles Quad) & Second Top (6000+ ft - 200P  -

I hate unfinished business. Ever since getting a view of  Rocky  Pk  when  I
climbed Klahhane Ridge from Lake Angeles in a day about a month and  a  half
ago I planned to return. I had a vague idea to climb it on that trip but  it
appeared to be no trivial matter and I ran out of  time.  Good  thing  as  I
doubt I could have made it under the snowy conditions I had  at  that  time.
This trip I planned to camp on Klahhane Ridge so  I  would  have  plenty  of
time.

Wednesday - High Camp and Second Top  -  I  approached  from  the  excellent
Switchback Trail, after getting a XC permit to camp on the ridge at the  WIC
in Port Angeles. The tourist season is in full swing  already.  The  parking
lot of the Visitor Center was completely full. The TH parking lot  was  also
full. It seems I picked the day the local Klahhane Hiking Club had  Klahhane
Ridge as its destination. I dodged dozens of hikers coming  down  the  trail
as I toiled up it. From Victor  Pass  (1.5  miles,  1500  ft,  1:15  hr),  I
followed the scenic ridge trail up and down about  1.5  miles  and  found  a
delightful secluded campsite on a rocky ledge just above the descent to  the
Klahhane-Rocky saddle (3 miles, 2000 ft, 2:15 hr).

I had planned for a leisurely trip but after setting up  camp  it  was  only
3:00. I didn\'t think I could handle just hanging around  doing  nothing  the
rest of the afternoon, despite having a good book to  read.  That  would  be
too leisurely. What to do? Well maybe I could make it up  Second  Top.  This
wasn\'t the most efficient way to do that as that meant I had to  retrace  my
steps 1.5 miles back to Victor Pass, but the ridge trail is beautiful and  I
really didn\'t mind. Once at Victor Pass I followed the Heather  Park  Trail,
first dropping 500 ft mostly on snow and then  climbing  snow  free  to  the
5800 ft saddle on the Mt  Angeles-Second  Top  Ridge.  This  ridge  is  very
pinnacled and once I crossed to the other side I saw that I  would  have  to
drop again several hundred feet to avoid cliffs. It was going to take a  lot
longer to get to Second Top than I had thought.

I lost the trail in snow to begin but found it lower down  as  it  traversed
past the appropriately named Egg Rock. Parts of this  steep  trail  traverse
also still had patches of tricky snow. There were no  footprints  indicating
anyone had been this way recently. I  had  to  go  almost  all  the  way  to
Heather Pass before the terrain  became  friendly  enough  to  start  uphill
toward Second Top. I worked my way  easily  to  the  summit  rocks  where  a
fascinating wide ramp on the S side led to a break in the wall and  a  short
class 3 pitch to the summit area (1500 ft, 3 hrs from camp).  I was back  to
my tent by 8:30 (6.5 miles, 2750 ft, 5:20 hrs RT from camp).

Total for the day: 9.5 miles, 4750 ft and 7:35 hrs

Thursday - Rocky Pk - I started at 8:30 by dropping almost 200 feet  to  the
5680 ft Klahhane-Rocky saddle. I further dropped to a low point of  5400  ft
following a faint goat/climber(?)  trail  that  traversed  at  the  base  of
cliffs on the south side of Rocky Pk. The Olympic Mountain Guide  Book  says
to "traverse  past  two  prominent  notches  to  an  obvious  greenish  rock
formation."  Well, I traversed up and down across several gullies past  what
I thought were two notches until I came to another deep  ravine  that  would
have required several hundred more feet of descent without ever  seeing  the
"obvious greenish rock". I have come to completely distrust the use  of  the
word "obvious" in route descriptions. Before this last ravine  was  a  break
(the only break) in the south side cliffs in the form of a broad  but  steep
gully. It looked doable to begin but also looked like it headed for  dubious
territory. Nevertheless, I took a chance and started up it.

All went well for several hundred feet. I climbed on the right edge  staying
out of the gully bottom until I came to a  short  step  that  gave  me  some
pause. I suppose it was only class 3 but the  rock  was  covered  with  ball
bearing slick loose gravel which did not inspire confidence. I tried on  the
right and backed off, but made it up  on  the  left.  And  then  I  hit  the
headwall, a small cirque of cliffs. I thought Rocky Peak was supposed to  be
class 3! There were  only  two  possible  breaks.  The  left  one  with  its
overhanging crack was impassible. The right one  was  a  full  on  class  4+
slab. I tried it and backed off, then dinked around for probably 45  minutes
looking for a better way. There  wasn\'t  one.  This  probably  meant  I  was
either off route or had once again been sandbagged by "Olympic Class 3".

With no other option (besides retreat) I tried  the  slab  again.  Expecting
nothing more than class 3 all I had with me was  my  100  ft  rope  and  two
slings and nothing at all to protect the lead. I really thought I could  get
up it. The slab was that solid volcanic rock peculiar to the  Olympics  with
good friction but rounded holds and void of cracks or horns.  But  I  really
couldn\'t see what was above and  I  was  worried  about  getting  into  more
difficulties than I could handle. I wasn\'t even sure I  could  find  anchors
to rappel down if I did run into trouble. With adrenaline  pumping  aplenty,
I made it up the slab. Above was a chimney,  still  steep  but  with  better
holds, and then ledges went right  around  a  gendarme  to  the  final  easy
slopes to the summit (1000 ft, 2:50). I left a register in a cairn  I  found
on the highest rock. Views were limited as  fog  and  clouds  were  swirling
about. I even heard some distant rumbling of thunder.

I used my two slings to rappel down the chimney  and  the  slab.  Luckily  I
found chockstone anchors for both. These were much steeper  rappels  than  I
usually like to do with the Dulfersitz but I had no other gear.  I  found  a
solid boulder to wrap the rope directly around to rappel the lower step  and
then I was home free and back to camp by 1:40 (2 miles,  1500  ft  5:20).  I
took a blissful nap before packing up and leaving at 4:00.

At the TH were signs warning of an aggressive goat harassing hikers.  I  ran
into this malevolent fellow just below Victor  Pass.  He  was  prancing  and
snorting and rearing and looked as though he would like nothing better  than
to do me bodily harm. He would not  let  me  pass.  I  could  just  see  the
embarrassing headlines - "experienced climber gored by a mountain goat."  To
avoid him I swallowed my ethics and cut a  switchback  to  the  trail  below
(1:45 hours out).

Tailgunner Pk (5842 ft - 482P) and Wing Pk (5760 ft - 400P) - Baring Quad  -
June 16, 2009

Beth wanted to climb Gunn. I wanted to climb  Tailgunner  and  Wing.  So  we
teamed up for the approach. We had both recently been in the area,  Beth  to
climb Tailgunner about a month earlier and me to climb Gunnshy in April,  so
we were familiar with the route. We still had the usual  trouble  connecting
the log jam crossing with the  climber\'s  trail  across  the  brushy  valley
bottom, but once we found it I for one was surprised at how good it was.  My
previous trip to Gunnshy had mostly been on snow and when  I  climbed  Gunn,
probably some 40 years ago, I didn\'t remember a trail at all.

The trail is very good until it hits a headwall where it traverses right  at
the base of the cliffs, descends steeply to cross a gully at 4000 then  goes
straight uphill through a wet slot to emerge from trees into an  open  basin
at about 4200 ft. Here was a trail junction. The  main  fork  took  a  sharp
left uphill while the right fork, which was covered with  sticks  indicating
the wrong way to go, went straight ahead into the basin.  Both  Beth  and  I
had previously gone straight but that had been  when  there  was  continuous
snow. Now much of it had melted and brush was appearing.  So  we  went  left
thinking this would avoid  the  brush.  Well,  it  led  steeply  up  through
unpleasant terrain with some brush and cliff bands on a seemingly  illogical
course until coming to a  small  waterfall  where  we  lost  it  completely.
Perhaps it just went up the waterfall  which  was  running  rather  wet  and
slippery for us and was not appealing.  Above  appeared  to  be  more  cliff
bands. At this point we gave up on the trail and  worked  our  way  slightly
down into the upper basin and onto snow. Perhaps when there is  no  snow  at
all and the basin very brushy the illogical  trail  makes  sense.  With  any
snow the basin is much easier.

 Once on snow we followed it up to the eastern-most (5400 ft) saddle on  the
Tailgunner-Wing ridge which inadvertently proved to be the best way off  the
ridge on the other side for Beth. This is where Beth and I parted company  a
little before 1:00. She headed for Gunn and I for Wing. Wing  proved  to  be
an enjoyable short 30 minute scramble along the ridge ending with  a  30  ft
class 3-4 pitch up the final summit rocks. Views were  still  good  while  I
was on top but they were rapidly  deteriorating  as  fog  began  rolling  in
while I made my way along the ridge to Tailgunner.  I  stuck  to  the  ridge
encountering a 10 foot vertical cornice  wall  on  top.  I  relaxed  on  the
summit until I could see Beth descending Gunn  (in  between  drifting  fog).
Not wanting to downclimb my vertical cornice, I descended to the W  thinking
it would be easier. It was not. I ended up on a very steep slope where  step
kicking down facing in some 100 ft slowed me  up  enough  that  Beth  and  I
arrived at the Wing saddle almost at the same time (at 4:00).  We  descended
from the saddle into the basin  following  snow  as  long  as  possible.  We
encountered some brush at the end getting back to the climbers trail at  the
bottom edge of the basin, but it was still better than our route up.

Repulse Pk (7923 ft - 523P - Mt Arriva Quad) - June 19, 2009

The original plan was to climb Bears Breast this weekend with  Stefan,  Erin
and Beth.  When the forecast didn\'t look good enough  for  that  major  rock
climb, Stefan changed it to a day climb of this peak. Beth made other  plans
but Greg joined us. Then the forecast deteriorated further to where  it  was
looking bleak indeed.  We went anyway. Well, we  didn\'t  have  the  best  of
weather but it certainly ended up so much better than it  could  have  been.
Rain constantly threatened but didn\'t become a reality  until  late  in  the
day when we were on our way out.

We began from the large turnout at Swamp  Cr  on  Hwy  20  a  little  before
10:00. Somehow we managed to hit Granite  Cr  right  at  the  wonderful  log
crossing a short ways above the confluence with "Repulse Cr". From there  it
was easy travel through lightly brushy woods up the left side of the  creek.
We were following the TR of Mitch (with Don and  cousin  Fred  Beavon)  from
2002. It soon became evident that we had much less snow than  they  had  and
we had more brush to contend with.  The worse patch was  in  the  middle  of
the lower basin.  Once  past  that  it  was  continuous  snow  to  the  many
waterfalled headwall. This was turned on the way up via a steep cruddy  dirt
gully with loose rock to a traverse above the waterfalls  that  led  to  the
upper basin. (Stefan found a better route on snow  for  the  way  down  that
avoided the gully.) From the upper basin it was an  easy  snow  traverse  to
the 7280 ft notch in the S ridge of Repulse (3300 ft, 4 hrs).

Now the fun began on class 3-4 rock up interesting and complicated  terrain.
To start it is important to drop slightly on the W side to a sandy  ramp  to
bypass a second notch. We followed the ramp up to cross  below  this  second
notch. Scrambling brought us to another  deep  gully  which  we  crossed  by
climbing up to the ridge crest at a third notch. It was pretty much class  3
to this point. From the third notch we had a choice of a short  gully  right
or a broken wall to the left. We chose the broken wall  to  the  left  which
had a short exposed class 4 section leading to a wide ramp and  ledge  above
the gully (the gully would be easier and led to the  same  spot).  The  next
section was the hardest, exposed class 4, again to the left, and  ending  at
a small tree. From the tree easier terrain appeared around the corner  above
yet another deep gully. We climbed up alongside this gully to a final  class
4 step that put us on the summit ridge at a fourth notch. The  rest  of  the
way along the crest to the summit was easy (4150 ft, 5:25 hrs).

The original summit register of 1971 mentioned  by  Mitch  was  still  there
with 4 entries total. Ours was the  fifth.  It  was  foggy  and  views  were
limited (never did get a good one of Arriva or Black),  but  we  were  happy
that it still had not done more than sprinkle. In fact we even had a  moment
of sun on the summit which heightened our  happiness.  We  stayed  maybe  20
minutes before heading down. We rappelled the class 4 pitch below  the  tree
and downclimbed everything else,  avoiding  the  second  class  4  pitch  by
descending the short gully from the broad ledge. Stefan had  placed  several
cairns on the way up which helped to keep us on track. It  waited  until  we
were back to the main notch before beginning to rain  lightly.  Nice  timing
as much of the rock is covered with black lichen and would be very slick  if
wet.

We had several reasonable glissades down the snow. By the  time  we  reached
the brush, it was wet though it still was not raining that hard, but by  the
time we reached the car at 7:40 we were all most definitely wet. Oh, but  it
could have been so much worse. At this point Stefan and Erin continued  east
for two more days of climbing, Greg drove home and I, not wanting to  tackle
the long drive home that night, car camped at Rainy  Pass  and  did  another
short climb the next day.

Total: 8 miles, 4300 ft and 9:40 hrs.

Repulse Pk (7923 ft - 523P - Mt Arriva Quad) - June 19, 2009

The original plan was to climb Bears Breast this weekend with  Stefan,  Erin
and Beth.  When the forecast didn\'t look good enough  for  that  major  rock
climb, Stefan changed it to a day climb of this peak. Beth made other  plans
but Greg joined us. Then the forecast deteriorated further to where  it  was
looking bleak indeed.  We went anyway. Well, we  didn\'t  have  the  best  of
weather but it certainly ended up so much better than it  could  have  been.
Rain constantly threatened but didn\'t become a reality  until  late  in  the
day when we were on our way out.

We began from the large turnout at Swamp  Cr  on  Hwy  20  a  little  before
10:00. Somehow we managed to hit Granite  Cr  right  at  the  wonderful  log
crossing a short ways above the confluence with "Repulse Cr". From there  it
was easy travel through lightly brushy woods up the left side of the  creek.
We were following the TR of Mitch (with Don and  cousin  Fred  Beavon)  from
2002. It soon became evident that we had much less snow than  they  had  and
we had more brush to contend with.  The worse patch was  in  the  middle  of
the lower basin.  Once  past  that  it  was  continuous  snow  to  the  many
waterfalled headwall. This was turned on the way up via a steep cruddy  dirt
gully with loose rock to a traverse above the waterfalls  that  led  to  the
upper basin. (Stefan found a better route on snow  for  the  way  down  that
avoided the gully.) From the upper basin it was an  easy  snow  traverse  to
the 7280 ft notch in the S ridge of Repulse (3300 ft, 4 hrs).

Now the fun began on class 3-4 rock up interesting and complicated  terrain.
To start it is important to drop slightly on the W side to a sandy  ramp  to
bypass a second notch. We followed the ramp up to cross  below  this  second
notch. Scrambling brought us to another  deep  gully  which  we  crossed  by
climbing up to the ridge crest at a third notch. It was pretty much class  3
to this point. From the third notch we had a choice of a short  gully  right
or a broken wall to the left. We chose the broken wall  to  the  left  which
had a short exposed class 4 section leading to a wide ramp and  ledge  above
the gully (the gully would be easier and led to the  same  spot).  The  next
section was the hardest, exposed class 4, again to the left, and  ending  at
a small tree. From the tree easier terrain appeared around the corner  above
yet another deep gully. We climbed up alongside this gully to a final  class
4 step that put us on the summit ridge at a fourth notch. The  rest  of  the
way along the crest to the summit was easy (4150 ft, 5:25 hrs).

The original summit register of 1971 mentioned  by  Mitch  was  still  there
with 4 entries total. Ours was the  fifth.  It  was  foggy  and  views  were
limited (never did get a good one of Arriva or Black),  but  we  were  happy

and downclimbed everything else,  avoiding  the  second  class  4  pitch  by

Hinkhouse Pk (7560+ ft - 760P - Washington Pass Quad) - June 20, 2009

After climbing Repulse Pk, I spent a restful night at the PCT North  parking
lot at Rainy Pass. It rained off and on during the night but  the  next  day
(Saturday) the weather began to clear. I had several possibilities of  peaks
to climb in the area and finally settled on Hinkhouse, just N of  Washington
Pass. I wanted a short easy peak that would get  me  home  at  a  reasonable
hour. Although it wasn\'t quite as short or easy as I thought it would be.

I started from the entrance to the Washington Pass Viewpoint. The  viewpoint
road itself is closed and gated for renovations. Also a  bike  ride  was  in
progress and this spot was being used as one of their stops. I was lucky  to
find a place to park. But I had a nice conversation with  two  EMTs  manning
an aid car. They had watched as I got my gear ready and looked  at  the  map
and wanted to know where I was going. They mentioned  that  if  I  got  into
trouble they were right there ready to help. Very reassuring.

The route up Hinkhouse is short and straightforward,  just  head  uphill  to
the top. Well, it isn\'t quite that simple. First I had to skirt a soggy  wet
marshy meadow. Then there were several slabby cliffbands  to  work  through.
None were difficult but the rock was still wet and slippery so I had  to  be
careful. The brush was also wet, and my boots,  already  wet  from  the  day
before, didn\'t keep my feet dry for very long. But the biggest surprise  was
when I topped out on the false summit and looked  over  to  the  main  rocky
summit across a narrow notch. It looked difficult. I  wasn\'t  expecting  any
rock climbing. I got more worried when I didn\'t immediately see a  way  into
the notch. Then I spotted a wide ledge below accessed by descending  NE  off
the false summit. Once at the notch  what  appeared  difficult  was  nothing
more than easy and fun class 3.

There was an interesting and informative register on top placed  9/15/01  by
One Step At A time, a climbing group for  recovering  alcoholics.  The  peak
had officially been renamed on 12/8/2000 in honor of Jimmy D. Hinkhouse  who
died in 1995 on Denali and was active in that  group.  An  earlier  register
(placed by the Mazamas) with entries dating from 1968  when  it  was  called
Washington Pass Pk had been removed and returned to the Mazamas. I added  my
name and noted mine was the first of 2009 and  there  were  none  for  2008,
unexpected for such an easily accessible peak.

This peak is a splendid viewpoint for  all  of  the  Washington  Pass  area.
Unfortunately, although the sun was out by now  many  of  the  higher  peaks
were in the fog. Still, I had reasonable views of the closer ones.  I  could
also look directly down to my car and my descent route.

Total: 2 miles, 2300 ft and 4 hrs RT at a leisurely pace.

June 23-24, 2009

Day 1 - Tuesday - Beargrass Butte - If you want  solitude  try  this  seldom
visited area of the Goat Rocks Wilderness. I entered  via  the  Three  Peaks
Trail, still on maps and in books but unmarked, unmaintained  and  obviously
little used. I drove Road 1266 from Packwood 6 miles to spur 1266-070  where
it is best to park if you don\'t have a 4X4 vehicle. I was able to  drive  an
additional .6 mile in my Jeep to a washout at 3500 ft.  I  then  walked  the
old road another .5 miles to the start of real trail. There  were  no  signs
anywhere along the route, but the trail start was marked by a large cairn.

The Three Peaks Trail essentially followed the up and  down  ridge  all  the
way to Mosquito Lake. It had many blowdowns but was easy to follow  until  I
lost it in snow at about 4800 ft. The entire way is  in  forest  and  passes
the edge of an  old  clear-cut  at  about  2.5  miles  before  entering  the
wilderness. I bypassed Mosquito Lake, picking up the Packwood Lake Trail  in
the saddle near its junction with the Coyote Trail. I dropped to  completely
snowed in Lost Lake where I had to search to find  a  small  patch  of  bare
ground under trees to camp (6 miles, 2800 ft, 4:30 hrs).

After setting up camp, I started for Beargrass Butte. I had had  a  view  of
it from the Three Peaks Trail on the way in so knew I would run into  cliffs
on the ridge from Lost Lake. Sure enough, by following  the  ridge  crest  I
eventually found myself stopped by pinnacles and a deep notch. I managed  to
squeak out a sketchy route down to easier terrain  without  using  my  rope.
Beargrass Butte is aptly named as the final easy slopes are a solid mass  of
beargrass. Oh, to be there when they are all in bloom.  What  a  sight  that
would be! On the way back I traversed below the cliffs of the  pinnacles  on
the south slope but it was still no piece of cake (3 miles, 1500 ft,  3  hrs
RT from camp).

Day 2 - Wednesday - Snowy1 (Pk6754) and Chimney Rock - I backtracked to  the
Coyote Trail junction. This trail was maybe  75%  snow  covered  but  I  was
still able to follow it much of the way  facilitating  traversing  past  the
cliffs of Pt 6497. Then solid snow led to the basin W of Snowy1  from  where
I spotted a gully route through the summit cliffs to  the  top  (2.5  miles,
1700 ft, 2:30 hrs). There was no cairn. I had a great view  into  the  heart
of the Goat Rocks. I made a call to my Dad in Albuquerque  on  the  occasion
of his 98th birthday and waved to Mt Rainier (which he climbed in  his  60s)
on his behalf.

I was uncertain how to continue on to Chimney Rock. I thought maybe I  would
have to descend my up route and take a circuitous route  to  the  connecting
ridge, but I managed to find a reasonable scramble down a very  loose  gully
directly to the S ridge. Easy  snow  made  travel  easy  to  the  cliffs  on
Chimney\'s N side but I could  see  no  obvious  easy  route  to  the  summit
through them. Hoping for a better route there, I crossed a  6400  ft  saddle
to the S side. The map showed the  Coyote  Trail  almost  reaching  to  this
saddle but it was in fact several hundred feet below  down  cliffy  terrain.
This is when it began to dawn on me I was in for a very  long  day.   I  did
find a semi-scramble route down but only because  there  was  no  anchor  to
rappel two class 4 steps.

Once on the Coyote Trail I used  it  to  traverse  below  the  cliffs.  This
traverse took longer than I hoped and was not all that easy where the  trail
was filled in with steep snow. Finally I turned  the  corner  on  a  SW  rib
where I could leave the trail and head up broken terrain to a notch  on  the
W ridge. The final summit rocks were a class 3  scramble  to  a  nondescript
false summit. I proclaimed a small pinnacle slightly farther E as  the  true
summit and my altimeter backed me up by reading 5 feet higher. A  peak  with
the name Chimney Rock requires a rocky summit (4 miles, 2450 ft, 5 hrs).

It was now 2:00 and I had a long ways yet to go if I wanted to make it  home
today. I returned to the Coyote trail and followed it all the way  back.  It
was longer than my in route but easier. I reached camp  at  5:15  (9  miles,
3000 ft, 8:30 hrs RT). I took time for some nutrition and a regenerating  30
minute nap before packing up and leaving at 6:30. The trail  out  seemed  to
go up much too much and the blowdowns loomed larger and more  annoying  than
the day before. Still, I made it to  my  car  by  10:00  without  needing  a
headlamp (6 miles, 1150 ft, 3:30 hrs from camp).

Total: 24 miles and 8500 ft in 2 days

What a wonderful, enjoyable and successful trip this turned out to  be.  Jim
and Eileen invited me along on their  plan  to  climb  Tupshin,  Devore  and
White Goat. Although I had  already  been  up  the  first  two  I  was  very
interested in the last one  and  there  were  several  other  peaks  in  the
vicinity I could climb on my own, so I  jumped  at  the  chance.  Beth  also
joined the party.

Day 1 (Thursday) - Bird Cr Camp - We  took  the  Lady  Express  to  Stehekin
where Beth and Eileen turned on the charm to hitch a ride  with  a  friendly
couple and their BIG dog on their private boat to Weaver Point.  This  saved
us 3 miles of extra walking along the river from Harlequin  Bridge.  It  was
still an effort though, to lug full packs heavy with  climbing  gear  and  6
days of food (for me) up the hot and brushy Devore Cr Trail and  all  of  us
were more than happy to stop at Bird Cr Camp (5 miles, 3000 ft, 5:30 hrs).

Day 2 (Friday) - Enigma Pk and Castle Rock - While the others were  climbing
Tupshin, I headed for Enigma.  I hiked about 2.5 miles up the trail until  I
was sure I was past the creek draining the west side of the peak  and  found
a nice log crossing of Devore Cr. Fairly open forest led to the  west  ridge
of Enigma which I followed, first on the crest and then on the  south  side,
to the summit pinnacles. The last 1000 ft was unpleasant  loose  scree.  All
the way up I was struck by the impressive view of the North Peak of  Riddle.
I was a little confused by which pinnacle was the highest. It turned out  to
be the one to the left of the notch I reached. I found no  register  in  the
cairn (3700 ft, 5 hrs).

From the notch I spotted a possible  route  directly  down  from  Enigma  to
Castle Cr Basin. I wasn\'t originally sure from looking at the  map  at  home
that this would go and was relieved when it did. But it was not without  its
challenges. I zigzagged my way 1800 feet down ledges and ramps  and  gullies
only needing one short rappel near the bottom to bypass  a  waterfall.  From
lovely Castle Cr Basin (elev 6200 ft), I started  up  again  once  past  the
rocky NW ridge of Flora. Pleasant  open  terrain  led  to  the  S  ridge  of
Castle. I tried staying on the crest but was forced by pinnacles  to  the  W
slope. After crossing two ribs, I was able to climb back to  the  ridge  and
summit where I could look straight down to Stehekin (5600 ft, 9 hrs).  Again
I found no register.

I now had to find a way back to  camp,  preferably  the  shortest  possible,
which certainly wasn\'t the way I had come. This  appeared  to  be  over  the
7200 ft saddle just to the N of Enigma. I had no  trouble  getting  to  this
saddle but once there I saw the other side was guarded by  a  200  ft  cliff
band. Darn! Well it did look steep on the map but I had hoped  it  would  be
easier. Nonetheless I did manage to tease out a sketchy scramble route  down
to skiers left. An open snow basin below  speeded  things  up  until  I  hit
horrible brush the last 1000 feet to Devore Cr. I could find no log  at  the
creek and with time getting short and me  getting  desperate  I  just  waded
across. I stumbled out of the brush on the other side  onto  the  trail  and
dragged into camp at 9:00. I was very surprised to find it still empty,  but
the others showed up shortly later at  9:30  after  a  successful  climb  of
their own. Total: 10 miles, 6500 ft and 14 hrs.

Day 3 (Saturday, July 4) - White Goat Mtn - With all  of  us  having  had  a
late day we didn\'t get a very early start. Beth,  more  interested  in  just
Tupshin and Devore and fighting the lingering effects of a virus elected  to
take a rest day. Jim, Eileen and I started for Bird Cr Basin  at  8:15.  Jim
did a great job of finding a mostly brush free  route  to  the  basin,  much
better than I remember from my climb of Devore several years ago. The  gully
leading to the Lakes Basin above was snow free.  We  reached  Bird  Lake  at
1:30. White Goat appeared to still be a depressingly  long  ways  away,  but
the distance was deceiving and the terrain easy and we were at the  base  of
the SE buttress at 3:00.

We all gasped at the route up the SE Buttress. My but  it  looked  steep.  I
was glad Jim was leading and what a marvelous job  he  did.  Eileen  belayed
Jim the full length of a 50M rope.  I went  second  cleaning  what  I  could
reach, and then belayed Eileen. It was steep but the holds were good.  There
was a nice belay ledge at the end. From the belay ledge Jim set a hand  line
for another half a rope length traverse  along  the  ridge  to  the  summit,
reached at 5:00 (3800 ft, 8:45 hrs). This section has to  be  the  narrowest
most exposed summit ridge I have  ever  been  on.  Jim\'s  description  of  a
potato chip on edge captures it perfectly.   It  simply  takes  your  breath
away and none of us could keep from wondering  what  kept  the  whole  thing
upright and from collapsing on sight.

The original 1940 summit register was still there. After signing it we  took
a few moments to revel in our airy perch before reversing the  traverse  and
doing one double rope rappel down the buttress. We  were  back  in  Bird  Cr
Basin at 8:45. Darkness caught us an hour later and greatly  contributed  to
us missing much of the up route and floundering in  brush  by  headlamp  the
rest of the way. We staggered into camp at 11:00, much to the  relief  of  a
worrying Beth. Total: 6.5 miles, 3900 ft and 14:45.

Day 4 (Sunday) -WyNorth - Another late night  led  to  another  late  start,
9:00. Our plan for this day evolved and changed with events. Originally  Jim
planned to move camp to Bird Cr Basin and do  both  Devore  and  White  Goat
from there. But none of us really wanted  to  lug  full  packs  through  the
brush up there. I could climb WyNorth from there  but  it  wasn\'t  the  most
direct route for me. While climbing Enigma I had a full  view  of  the  West
Fork Devore Cr. It sure looked like a good route to me to my peak  and  even
a good way up Devore. With additional beta I  had  gotten  before  from  Don
Goodman (and from some Beth had gotten from climbers passing through on  her
rest day) we decided to climb both peaks this way.

The West Fork Devore Creek turned out to be a  very  nice  route.  There  is
very little brush and the terrain is easy. A  short  waterfall  headwall  is
passed by traversing left at about 6200 ft to a gentle basin and then  right
again.  At about 7200 ft and 1:30 we parted company. I went left to  WyNorth
and the others went right to Devore. I climbed some  steep  snow  (the  only
time I needed my ice axe the whole trip) and some easy rock  to  the  summit
ridge just shy of Pt 8200+. Since I was so close I  climbed  this  point  on
the way. I then had to descend slightly to bypass  a  couple  of  pinnacles.
The summit block is climbed via a class 2 ramp  on  the  right  or  a  short
class 3-4 pitch on the left (4100 ft, 6 hrs). I  found  Don  Goodman\'s  film
can register from 2007. There were no other entries.  For  those  interested
in such details, I took my clinometer along and sighted from each summit  to
the other. 8202 is definitely higher than 8200+.

On my way down I caught sight of first  one,  then  two  figures,  at  about
3:45, on the summit of Devore so I knew my friends were successful.  It  was
an easy trip back to camp which I reached at 6:45 with finally  enough  time
and energy to wash up head to toe. I felt refreshingly clean. I also  ate  a
hearty dinner and took a nap before  the  others  showed  up  at  9:30  with
reports of beginning sprinkles, but nothing ever came  of  them.  (Total:  7
miles, 4350 ft, 9:45 hrs).

Day 5 (Monday) - WyEast - I had one more peak to climb if possible  and  was
prepared to stay a day longer than the others to accomplish  that.  Jim  and
Eileen packed up and left at 8:00. Beth was meeting a  friend  on  Wednesday
for a climb of Reynolds and planned on a layover day in Stehekin.  She  left
at 9:00, as did I - but for WyEast. The day was  cloudy  with  sunbreaks  to
start. I made it the 4 miles to the gorgeous flower meadows of 4th  of  July
Basin before  it  became  clear  to  me  that  the  weather  was  definitely
changing. I could see a front approaching and a cold  wind  kicked  up  that
lowered the temperature at least 20 degrees. I got cold for the  first  time
on this trip and had to put on all the extra clothes I was carrying. By  the
time I was in the summit gully (much loose scree) it began to  sprinkle.  At
the notch right of Pt 8220 it began to snow and visibility shrank.

 Uncertain exactly where the summit was, I traversed on easy ledges  past  a
first pinnacle, regained the ridge, went up a sandy gully to the  top  of  a
second pinnacle and followed the ridge on class 3-4 black lichened  rock  to
what appeared to be the high point except that I  saw  no  rappel  sling  or
cairn. It was snowing and blowing and I was  getting  cold  and  discouraged
when what to my wondering eyes should appear at my very  feet  but  a  cairn
with a film can register inside (4050 ft, 4:50 hrs). Glory be!  A  few  feet
away I found the rappel sling and the  class  4  chimney  mentioned  by  Don
Goodman. I had bypassed it completely.

I could have downclimbed my up route if the rock had had been  dry,  but  it
was not and the black lichen was  slicker  than  Teflon.  So  I  elected  to
rappel the chimney. My 100 ft rope made it easily.  It  rained  lightly  off
and on all the way back to camp, not enough to get the upper part of me  wet
but enough to saturate my feet in the wet meadows and  brush.  It  continued
to rain that evening and forced me to eat dinner in my tent.  I  was  lonely
that night and truly missed the cheerful company of  Jim,  Eileen  and  Beth
(Total: 10 miles, 4100 ft, 9:20 hrs).

Day 6 (Tuesday) - Stehekin - It didn\'t rain any more during  the  night  but
the brush was still wet on the way out. The lower half  of  me  got  soaked.
About 1000 ft above the lake the trail dried out and so did  I,  except  for
my feet which were hopeless at this point. I picked up  clothes  stashed  at
the junction with the river trail and walked the 3 miles we had  avoided  on
the way in to the Harlequin Bridge. I left at 7:15 and  reached  the  bridge
at 12:00 (8 miles, 300 ft, 4:45 hrs). I  washed  up  and  changed  to  clean
clothes and blessedly dry socks and was waiting for the 12:40  shuttle  when
a nice lady in a pickup offered  me  a  ride  into  town.  I  had  the  most
delicious ham sandwich I have ever had at the restaurant. I  can\'t  remember
when I have ever been so famished. Beth found me at the boat dock  and  gave
me some gear to  take  out  she  wouldn\'t  need  on  Reynolds.  I  was  very
reluctant   to   part    and    officially    end    a    fantastic    trip.

Sometimes you just get lucky.  Tom Sjolseth had been planning this trip  for
months with 5 other companions when all 5 had to cancel at the  last  minute
for various reasons leaving him with no partner. When  he  contacted  me  to
see if I was available I could hardly believe it. To  do  a  climb  of  this
caliber with such an experienced climber  was  a  dream  come  true.  I  had
always thought such a trip beyond me, partially because I am not capable  of
carrying the required heavy gear and food for such a  long  trip.  When  Tom
added he would carry ALL the group gear - tent, stove, rope, rack  AND  half
my food, how could I refuse such an offer?  I had 2 days to get ready.  Good
thing I am retired.

Day 1 (Tuesday, July 14) - Luna Camp -  We made arrangements  to  catch  the
water taxi across Ross Lake to Big Beaver Trail at 11:15 and hiked  the  hot
and buggy 10 miles to Luna Camp. Tom arrived a good 30 minutes ahead  of  me
despite his very heavy pack (1360 ft, 4:45 hrs).

Day 2 (Wednesday, July 15) - Access Cr to Bivy Below Luna Col -  We  crossed
Big Beaver Cr on the logjam about Â½ mile upstream from Luna Camp,  traversed
to Access Cr, crossed to the north side at about 2800  ft,  crossed  to  the
south again at 3900 ft (cairn on large  rock  here),  hopped  talus  to  the
basin east of Luna and worked our way up steep gullies to the 6200 ft  notch
in the ridge above. From the notch views opened up as we  traversed  heather
and ledges to a nice bivy on slabs near running water at 6600 ft  (5  miles,
4800 ft, 12:30). A tough day. Bugs were ferocious and we had to  sleep  with
headnets on to remain sane.

Day 3 (Thursday, July 16) - East Fury - We moved camp to Luna  Col  at  7200
ft and then took off for East Fury intending to bivy with only sleeping  bag
and pad on the summit to allow a full day to  climb  West  Fury.  The  usual
route to the ridge takes an "obvious" ledge directly above the  col  but  we
found our own way up a gully to the SE. The route then winds its way up  and
down more or less along the ridge. Much of the way is easy  scrambling  with
several steps of class 4 -low class 5. We did it all  unroped.  The  steeper
stuff was fairly solid with good holds and I never felt  uncomfortable.  The
last step is usually turned by a low traverse  down  and  around  cliffs  to
snow on the SE slope (we returned this way). We elected to stay  on  a  more
direct line up the ridge, climbing exposed somewhat loose class 4 rock.  The
last bit to the summit was snow (3 miles, 3200 ft,  9  hrs).  A  Mountaineer
register dating back to 1984 was on top. We each found a flat  slab  to  set
up our bivy. This was my first summit  bivy  and  conditions  couldn\'t  have
been more perfect. It was really quite comfortable. Both sunset and  sunrise
were spectacular.

Day 4 (Friday, July 17) - West Fury - East and West Fury are very  close  in
elevation but the West Peak is generally considered to be the  higher  by  a
few feet. It is also much more difficult to  attain.  Despite  being  little
more Â½ mile away, Beckey quotes a RT time of 6-8 hours from  the  East  Peak
along a convoluted ridge with 4 major pinnacles to bypass.  Hence  our  bivy
and early start. The route itself is difficult to describe and  most  likely
different for every party. Tom did an excellent  job  finding  the  way.  We
began by descending rock and snow to the first wall. I needed  crampons  for
the last bit to access the rock. Tom managed without. Once on  rock  exposed
ledges led up and around to easier terrain. It would be  difficult  to  find
the way back down this section and in  fact  we  made  two  rappels  on  the
return to avoid it. We crossed several cols,  did  an  exposed  bit  on  the
ridge crest, downclimbed a steep dike 0.75 of the way but rappelling  the  last
bit to another col, (we were able to climb back up  the  whole  way  on  the
return) before coming to the last obstacle which was climbed via a  somewhat
hidden chimney with old rappel slings at the top. From  there  it  was  easy
scrambling to the summit which we reached at 10:15 (.5 miles, 900  ft,  3:50
hrs). The original summit register from 1958 was on top.

We were back to the East Summit by 2:50 for a RT time of 8:20.  We  did  the
whole route unroped but did do 4 rappels total. I found the climbing  to  be
within my comfort level and I really  enjoyed  all  the  rock  climbing.  We
continued on from the East summit to Luna Col downclimbing  the  whole  way.
It did seem to have gained in length though. We reached the col and camp  at
6:30 (4 miles, 3000 ft, 12:00 hrs).

Day 5 (Saturday, July 18) - Camp Below Challenger - Tom climbed Luna (2  hrs
RT!) in the morning while I rested and organized my gear. Then we packed  up
and headed for Challenger. The first part of  the  route  down  toward  Luna
Lake was delightful, through lovely heather and flower gardens with  gushing
creeks and waterfalls. We thought the descent ended at  the  lake.  No  such
luck. We still had to drop almost  a  thousand  feet  more  on  awful  loose
moraine scree and talus depressingly close to unattractive Lousy Lake.  Then
more unpleasant traversing until we could finally start  up  again.  It  was
very deceiving and much farther  than  it  looked.  We  worked  our  way  up
pleasant slabs near many waterfalls (one class 4 section) until Tom found  a
nice flat slab for the tent at 6200 ft, where I was more than ready to  stop
(4 miles, 3100 ft descent, 2500 ft gain, 7 hrs).

Day 6 (Sunday, July 19) - Mt Challenger - We took a direct route up snow  to
Challenger Arm at 7500 ft, dropped our  full  packs  and  continued  up  the
beautiful NW snow arÃªte to the base of the summit rocks where  Tom  led  the
5.7 pitch to the summit arriving at 12:30. This is the  only  place  on  the
entire trip where we roped up. There was no register. We enjoyed  the  views
for the better part of  an  hour,  rappelled  the  rock  pitch  and  quickly
returned to our packs. A long glissade brought us to the broad  saddle  with
Pk 7374. There were several nice tent  sites  here  but  we  elected  to  go
slightly farther to a delightful bivy on a  heather  bench  just  below  the
summit of Pk 7374 (4 miles, 2700, 7:30 hrs). There was  even  a  small  melt
water pond to soak my increasingly aching feet. This has to be  one  of  the
most scenic spots in all of the Northern Pickets. A little slice  of  heaven
with no bugs.

Being so close we also popped up to the summit of Pk 7374 (654P).

Day 7 (Monday, July 20) - Eiley-Wiley Ridge to Luna Camp  -  A  tiring  day.
Eiley-Wiley is a long ridge with many ups and downs. We began by dropping  a
bit to get around cliffy Pk 7374. Then it was pleasant ridge  rambling  past
Wiley and Eiley Lakes until coming to Pk 6984 (no time or  energy  for  this
one). This was turned on the SE to a nice basin at 6200 ft. From  the  basin
on was unpleasant steep sidehill crossing many gullies. We tried to stay  on
a high contour but terrain and cliffs forced us ever  downward  after  which
we had to climb back up to gain the forested exit ridge  that  led  straight
down to Beaver Pass. Here  the  bugs  became  almost  intolerable.  Once  at
Beaver Pass we intersected the trail on the east side of Big Beaver Cr  (not
so big here) and followed it 4.5 miles to Luna Camp. By  this  point  I  was
suffering greatly and slowly limped down the trail, reaching  camp  over  an
hour after Tom (9 miles, 1700 ft, 11 hrs).

Day 8 (Tuesday, July 21) - Big Beaver Dock - Our scheduled  pickup  time  at
the dock was 12:30. With the 10 mile distance, we left early,  Tom  at  6:15
and me at 6:30, to assure we didn\'t miss the boat  -  literally.  It  seemed
much longer than on the way in and seemed to go on forever.  Heat  and  bugs
didn\'t help. I limped in at 11:45. I  think  Tom  made  it  sometime  before
10:00. (10 miles, 560 ft, 5:15 hrs).  On the way back  from  a  drop-off  up
lake, the taxi saw us and picked us up early at  12:00.  We  still  had  the
mile and 500 ft climb from the lake to the  car  on  Highway  20  before  we
could both feed our starving bodies in Marblemount.

This trip was difficult and challenging for me into an area I never  thought
I would be able to go. But it was a wonderful adventure I will  remember  it
the rest of my life. I have Tom to thank for it.

Total: 51 miles and 20, 400 ft in 8 days.

3-5, 2009.

After seeing them from both my recent trips, to  the  Northern  Pickets  and
Thornton Peak, I was  eager  to  make  my  first  entry  into  the  Southern
Pickets. I felt I could  probably  solo  the  easiest  of  the  bunch,  West
McMillian Spire, but I did have some concerns about  the  condition  of  the
route. Then I learned John Roper and his son Aaron had just done  the  peak.
That synched it and off I went.

Day 1: Monday, August 3 - To High  Camp  -  At  the  Wilderness  Information
Center in Marblemount, upon recognizing my name Kelly Bush,  the  ranger  in
charge of search and rescue for the entire  North  Cascades,  appeared  from
the back room to greet me and find out what I was up to. She is such a  nice
woman although I sure hope I never have  to  use  her  services.  We  had  a
pleasant conversation after which the young ranger issuing my permit  didn\'t
question me other than to ask if I planned to get all the way to  high  camp
today. I said I sure hoped so.

I drove to the Upper Goodell Campground and parked in a  small  lot  at  the
very end of the road a couple hundred feet past the group  site.  The  whole
place was completely deserted. I had heard horror stories of the Goodell  Cr
climber\'s trail. It turned out to be much better  than  I  expected.  It  is
certainly better then the two  approaches  I  have  taken  to  the  Northern
Pickets - Access Cr and Eiley-Wiley Ridge. The first 4 miles follows an  old
road and is in generally good shape except for a  short  brushy  section  in
the middle and several washed out creeks. After leaving the road it is  very
steep but fairly brush free and for the most part  easily  followed  if  one
stays alert. The only really bad parts  are  a  vertical  root  ladder  just
before breaking out into heather and where it follows a stream bed  for  200
ft and all signs of tread disappear. This stream  had  a  trickle  of  water
that allowed me to camp nearby on a heather bench. It was  the  first  water
encountered since leaving the road.  I  wanted  to  camp  here  rather  than
farther on to allow me to also climb the Roost.

Total: 7 miles, 4800 ft and 7:20 hrs.

Day 2: Tuesday, August 4 - West McMillian Spire  and  Glee  Peak  (aka  High
Ross and Pk 7200+) - I picked up good tread as it left the  stream  bed  and
followed it up and down all the way to the 6240 ft saddle in a  spur  ridge.
Horrible loose scree and hard packed dirt  on  the  other  side  had  to  be
descended several hundred feet until reaching a nice flat area  at  5900  ft
with good camping sites. Now began a long descending traverse over  pleasant
terrain to a low point of 5500 ft  at  the  outlet  of  a  still  iced  over
glacial lake. Once across this I could finally start up beautiful  slabs  to
the edge of the Terror Glacier.  I  had  worried  about  the  glacier  being
broken up and difficult to cross but in fact this section was  more  like  a
snowfield and no problem at all. I climbed the glacier until it narrowed  to
a snow finger leading to the Inspiration-West  McMillan  col.  It  was  late
enough in the day that the snow had softened and crampons were  not  needed,
but it got steep enough and thin enough near the  top  that  I  exited  onto
awful loose cruddy rock and dirt. This soon gave way to heather  and  better
but still somewhat loose rock on the west ridge. I  reached  the  summit  at
1:45 and signed the register right after John and  Aaron  (3.5  miles,  3700
ft, 6:20 hrs). Views of Inspiration, Degenhardt and Terror were stunning  as
were the rest of the surrounding area. Although I really  didn\'t  think  the
climb of West McMillan to be of the highest quality, as a viewpoint  it  has
few peers.

I now focused my attention on getting to  Glee.  I  really  didn\'t  want  to
descend all the way back to the glacial lake outlet.  I  could  see  a  high
route that traversed above the cliffy glacial lake cirque  to  the  6200  ft
saddle in the ridge above Azure Lake that would save about 800 ft  and  this
is the way I went. It turned out to  be  a  delightful  route  on  snow  and
lovely slabs, across many little rushing creeks, in and out  of  mini  slots
and past several dramatic notches, full of interest and variety. One of  the
most enjoyable traverses I have ever done.  After traversing  below  several
bumps, I finished on the NW ridge which was capped by a short class  4  step
to the summit of Glee (5000 ft, 11:15 hrs). I was surprised to find a  large
register but it was a useless soggy mess and illegible. I  easily  descended
the south side to a snowfield that led to the heather spur ridge  above  the
6240 saddle where I picked up the climber\'s trail and returned to camp.

Total: 8 miles, 5100 ft and 13:15 hrs.

Day 3: Wednesday, August 5 - The  Roost  -  What  an  absolutely  delightful
climb this was along a gorgeous gentle heather ridge all the way.  It  ranks
up there with my best ridge rambles  ever.  And  what  a  roomy  comfortable
viewpoint the summit is. I can see why it is called The Roost. I would  have
liked to "roost" there for a very long time. It would certainly be  a  dandy
place to camp. Most climbers coming to this area are  lured  to  the  higher
West McMillan Spire (or other Picket peaks), but truth  be  told  both  Glee
and The Roost are more enjoyable climbs.  3 miles, 1600 ft and 3:50 hrs RT.

All too soon it was time  to  leave  and  begin  the  long  unpleasant  knee
jarring, foot sore descent out. I reached the old road in 3  hours  and  the
car in 2.5  more, after stopping for Â½ hour to soak my aching  feet  in  the
creek near the junction. I reached the car at 6:00 (7 miles,  200  ft,  5:30
hrs) only to be greeted with a notice  on  my  windshield  that  I  was  not
allowed to park where I did ("this is not a parking lot or a trailhead"  but
a reserved area and I was to pay $25 per night to camp). You have got to  be
kidding! Hot, sweaty and tired I really did not need this at the end of  the
day. I was not parked in any campsite and the  irony  was  that  the  entire
campground was still deserted. Where the heck are you supposed to  park?  It
was too late to resolve the situation at either the Newhalem Visitor  Center
or the Marblemount RS but  I  called  the  next  day  from  home.  Evidently
campground enforcement is completely separate from backcountry and  the  two
don\'t always communicate. I did after all have a  valid  backcountry  permit
with my license plate number in the computer system. I was told there is  no
other place to park except in the campground  but  there  is  another  small
area  before  the  group  site  that  might  be  more  acceptable   to   law
enforcement. If parking is  such  a  problem  perhaps  signs  should  direct
climbers where to legally park. The confusion  is  not  going  away  as  all
climbers using the Goodell Cr trail have to park somewhere.

Grand Total: 25 miles and 11,700 ft in 3 days.

The Citadel (7120+ ft - 440P - Mt Daniel Quad) - August 15-16, 2009

Thwarted once again by weather to try Mt  Triumph,  we  came  up  with  this
absolutely delightful 2-day trip as  a  last  minute  alternative.  It  just
doesn\'t get any  better  than  this  -  easy  approach,  beautiful  scenery,
pleasant  cross-country  travel,  no  bugs,  no  brush,  ideal  weather  and
wonderful company (Jim, Eileen, Beth and John Myers).

Day1 (Saturday - August 15): The Citadel - From Cathedral Pass we  took  the
trail to Peggys Pond where we picked up a  very  good  fisherman\'s  path  to
Circle Lake (6.5 miles, 3500  ft,  5:20  hrs).  After  setting  up  camp  we
started for The Citadel traversing gentle heather and interesting  slabs  to
a short loose scree slope that led to the north ridge. This  was  capped  by
50 feet of class 3-4 with loose blocks that required caution  and  a  narrow
exposed summit ridge. We were all surprised to find a register in very  good
shape dating back several  decades  and  had  fun  reading  through  it  and
recognizing many names. Our  summit  was  under  a  sunny  hole  but  clouds
obscured most of the peaks around us except for Mt Daniel. We rappelled  the
rock pitch and were back in camp in time  to  complete  dinner  in  daylight
(1.3 miles, 1200 ft, 2:55 hr RT including almost an hour on top).

Day 2 (Sunday, August 16): Cathedral Rock -  Everything  had  gone  so  much
easier and quicker  than  expected  (how  often  does  that  happen  in  the
mountains?) that we were now left with the choice  of  going  out  early  or
seeking a way to extend our  stay.  In  such  a  beautiful  area  with  such
perfect conditions of course we chose the  latter.  The  choices  for  bonus
peaks nearby were Mt Daniel and Cathedral Rock. Jim, Beth and I had  already
climbed both, but John and Eileen had done  neither.  John  elected  to  add
Daniel to his resume with an early 6 am start, while the rest of us  decided
to accompany Eileen up Cathedral Rock, leaving camp several hours later.  We
returned to Cathedral Pass (600 ft, 1:45  hrs)  to  leave  our  large  packs
before starting the climb.

It had been several decades since I had climbed Cathedral Rock so my  memory
was a bit fuzzy, as was Jim\'s and Beth\'s. But we managed to find our way  up
the gully that steepened to a chimney (turned on the left) to  the  base  of
the summit pitch without a route description (no one  knew  Cathedral  would
be part of the agenda). This peak is climbed so often there  is  essentially
a climber\'s trail all the way up. We were also challenged by having  limited
gear - only a short 100 foot 8mm scramble rope  and  a  few  slings  but  no
other pro for the 4 of us. Fortunately the climbing portion  is  only  about
100 ft long with solid rock and good holds. Beth led up and the rest  of  us
came after on a fixed line with a  prussik.  After  that  a  scramble  of  a
couple hundred feet distance put us on top. Two rappels got us back down.  I
had forgotten how much fun this peak was (1.2 miles, 1100 ft,  3:35  hrs  RT
from Cathedral Pass). John was waiting for us  when  we  reached  the  TH  2
hours later. We ended a perfect outing with dinner at the Old #3 in Ronald.

Total: 16 miles and 6500 ft in 2 days

Quad - August 21-23, 2009

The challenge of a trip like this, where the travel is easy, is  to  combine
all the peaks in a day\'s timeframe in the most efficient manner possible.

Day 1 - Friday, August 21: Andrew Pass - The approach was  via  the  Andrews
Cr trail. The entire valley was burned in the devastating Farewell  Fire  of
a few years ago. There is much greenery in  the  understory  but  the  stark
black trees offer little to no shade. What with the 4.5 -hour  drive  I  got
none too early a start and by the time  I  hit  the  trail  (12:30)  it  was
already 82 degrees, which made for very hot going to  start.  Fortunately  a
stiff breeze soon materialized to cool things off although it  did  cause  a
spooky sound as it whistled through the dead trees. I was surprised  at  the
lack of campsites along this trail. There was only one other, at  about  the
7 mile mark, before reaching Andrew Pass.

I had planned to take the Peepsight Trail (8  miles  in)  and  camp  in  the
basin east of Peepsight Mtn but I could not find the trail junction.  I  was
forced to continue on the main trail another 4 miles. It  was  getting  late
and I was getting worried about finding a campsite with water when  I  found
both just before Andrew Pass. Andrew Cr had dwindled to a  mere  trickle  by
this time but it was sufficient to serve my needs.  This  location  actually
turned out to be a better starting point for a loop  peakbagging  trip  that
would not involve repeating any terrain (12 miles, 3800 ft, 7 hrs).

Day 2 - Saturday, August 22 - From Andrew Pass I just  headed  up  the  east
slopes to the summit of Amos Pk (1550 ft, 1:45 hr).  The terrain  was  open,
brushless and pleasant. I then followed the ridge south to  Andrew  Pk.  The
last bit had some interesting class 3+ blocky climbing before  leveling  off
near the summit (2200 ft, 3:25 hrs). The next objective was Freds Mtn.  This
is the peak I figured would give me the most  trouble.  Not  because  it  is
difficult but just because it is so darn far away. It  is  on  a  very  long
ridge that encompasses 3 basins and naturally the high point is at the  very
farthest end. It seemed to me the shortest route was  to  drop  1600  ft  to
Glory Lake in basin 1, traverse into basin 2 and climb onto the ridge  above
basin 3 near Pt 7960. Once past Pt 7960 I followed  the  west  side  of  the
ridge north to the summit where I  found  a  large  well  constructed  cairn
(3900 ft, 7:30 hrs).  From  Freds  I  essentially  followed  the  convoluted
ridge or its west side south all the way  to  Peepsight  Mtn  (4800  ft,  10
hrs). To return to Andrew Pass I descended to Crazy Man Pass where I  picked
up the Rock Lake Trail. This  trail  is  little  used  and  hard  to  follow
through meadows but is cairned and has been logged out since  the  fire.  In
waning light I lost the trail completely as it  traversed  the  east  slopes
below Andrew Pk so just headed downhill to intersect the Andrew  Pass  Trail
reaching camp at 9:00 (12 miles, 5100 ft, 12:45 hrs).

I left a register on each of the peaks as none had any I could find.

Day 3 - Sunday, August 23 - It was very windy and cold  in  the  morning.  I
waited until the sun hit my tent at 8:30 before packing up  and  leaving  at
9:30. On the way out I looked again for the  Peepsight  Trail  junction  and
again could not find it. I was having lunch at the 7 mile  campsite  when  a
wrangler leading a pack train of 6 mules showed up. He was bringing out  the
gear of a group of hikers who had spent a week at Remmel Lake. That mode  of
transportation was looking pretty good to me at that moment.  Maybe  someday
I will give it a try. Since I figured he would know, I asked him  where  the
Peepsight Trail was. He said it was about Â½ mile up from this  camp  but  it
was unmarked and hard to locate.  He told me the Pasayten Wilderness  had  a
policy of deliberately not marking lesser trails and  making  them  obscure.
Why on earth? And to  what  purpose?  He  really  didn\'t  know.  Perhaps  to
"increase the wilderness experience". And just how  does  it  "increase  the
wilderness experience", I would like to know, when you can\'t find  a  trail?
He told me of one couple who got lost and wandered around for a  day  and  a
half on unmarked trails trying to find Lower Cathedral Lake.

I stopped to soak my aching feet twice before reaching the car at 4:00.  (12
miles, 200 ft, 6:30 hrs).

Grand Total: 36 miles and 9100 ft in 3 days

In June of 2005 I had to pass up half a dozen peaks around  Horseshoe  Basin
while climbing Windy, Bauerman Ridge, Apex, Wolframite and others on a  long
loop trip. I just didn\'t have the time.  But  I  had  always  planned  on  a
return just for those I missed. All these peaks are  easy  pleasant  ascents
through gentle meadows and open tundra, more hikes than climbs. There is  no
brush but terrain that is deep green in color often  indicates  bog  and  is
like trying to walk across a 6 inch deep sponge  carpet.  Despite  signs  of
plentiful water earlier in the area, sources were already beginning  to  dry
up and by late summer finding water could become a problem. I do  know  that
Louden Lake usually dries completely.

Day 1 - Wednesday, August 26: Pick Pk and Horseshoe Mtn - I  was  under  the
impression that Horseshoe Basin had been badly burned since  my  2005  trip.
That is certainly true for the approach from the Iron Gate TH. However,  the
Basin itself has been spared and it as lovely as ever. The 5.5  hour  drive
didn\'t put me on the trail until 2:00 but with a short and easy approach  of
6 miles I still had plenty of time to climb Pick Pk  and  Horseshoe  Mtn  on
the way in to camp. Pick I climbed from slightly before Sunny  Pass.  I  was
greeted by the cutest array of cairns I have ever encountered on  a  summit.
It appears that everyone who makes the top adds a rock and I  did  likewise.
For Horseshoe I headed  upslope  slightly  past  Sunny  Pass.  For  fun  and
variety I also climbed 3 tiny pinnacles just below the top.

I was hoping to camp right  at  Horseshoe  Pass  where  I  knew  there  were
several spacious sites but when I arrived there at 7:00 another  party  with
an annoying barking dog had already occupied it. So I continued on  a  short
ways and found a secluded spot in the trees  below  the  trail  and  near  a
small creek that gave me a buffer from  the  irritating  noise.  Talk  about
destroying the tranquility of the wilderness. I also heard  the  howling  of
coyotes in the distance (which may be why the dog  was  constantly  barking)
but that sound I enjoyed and it fit with the wilderness.

Total: 8 miles, 2500 ft and 5 hrs

Day 2 - Thursday, August 27: Rock Mtn, "Mt Regard",  Armstrong  Mtn,  Arnold
Mtn and Goodenough Pk - From my camp I crossed gorgeous meadows to the  base
of Rock Mtn, skirted a bog and easily climbed  the  east  slope.  It  was  a
glorious day with glorious views in all directions.  Windy  Pk  may  have  a
trail all the way to the top but it is still an impressive looking  mountain
and it dominated the vista. I descended the east slope on  the  way  to  "Mt
Regard". Upon hearing from John Roper that this peak had  no  name  that  he
was aware of we conspired to give it this  one  as  we  both  considered  it
worthy of "regard". The summit was an interesting jumble of boulders.

I descended Regard to climb the west slopes of Armstrong.  Armstrong  has  a
very broad flat summit plateau with  Monument  103  on  the  west  edge  and
Monument 104 of the US-Canada border on the east  edge.  The  US  summit  is
marked by a cairn south of Monument 104 but the highest point (by  about  10
feet and confirmed by my two  altimeters  and  by  clinometer  sighting)  is
actually slightly north of Monument 103 in Canada. I ate my lunch at the  US
summit cairn.

I dropped to wide and beautiful Snehumption Gap to climb Arnold,  marked  by
a windbreak cairn. All these high peaks are almost always windy. I had  been
going at a leisurely pace and spent at least 30 minutes on each  summit  but
such was the ease of travel that it was still only 3:00 and much  too  early
to return to camp. Since it looked so inviting I continued along the  grassy
east ridge of Arnold all the way to Goodenough Pk. I picked up the trail  in
the saddle between it and Arnold, following it back to  camp  at  6:00.  The
party with the barking dog was gone and I had peace and quiet for  the  rest
of the evening.

Total: 13 miles, 4300 ft, 10 hrs

Day 3 - Friday, August 28: Hodges Horse Pasture - I left  at  8:30  for  the
easy trip out to the TH (6 miles, 400 ft, 2:30 hrs).  On  the  drive  out  I
stopped by the side of the  road  for  the  short  hike  through  grass  and
sagebrush up Hodges Horse Pasture (.5 miles, 450 ft, :30 RT).

Grand Total: 27.5 miles and 7250 ft in 3 days

Mt Triumph (7240+ ft - 1720P - Mt Triumph Quad) - September 11-13, 2009

Jim, Eileen and I had made an attempt on Mt Triumph  the  end  of  July  but
were thwarted by 2 days of intense  thunderstorms.  We  had  to  settle  for
Thornton Pk and were darn lucky to get even that. We rescheduled for  August
but ended up limited to 2 days and had to change plans.  We tried again  for
the Labor Day weekend which as everyone knows  was  a  total  washout.  This
time around we finally hit it right and had perfect weather. We were  joined
by Kevin W and Kevin K.

Day 1: Friday, September 11 - We approached via the 6  mile  Thornton  Lakes
trail. From the lower lake outlet we followed a series of  way  trails  past
campsites, up  and  down  over  several  humps,  through  some  minor  brush
bypassing a cliffband and onto the broad lovely spur  leading  to  the  main
Thornton Ridge. Once on this, travel was delightful.  This being our  second
time here (3rd for Jim) we had no problem with route finding  and  used  the
same bivy site as before (adequate but not overly spacious).  Worried  about
water availability this late in the season, we all hauled some up  from  the
lake but we did find a source in a gully that still held some snow  not  too
far from camp. Good thing as  the  day  was  very  hot  and  we  all  needed
prodigious amount of liquid to stay hydrated.

Total: 8 miles, 4300 ft and 7:30 hrs.

Day 2: Saturday, September 12 - From camp we traversed  the  right  side  of
the ridge past a bump to the last saddle south of Thornton Pk  then  dropped
about 800 feet on talus, heather and blueberries  to  get  past  cliffs.  We
crossed one unpleasant loose dirt gully that had a good flow  of  water.  We
encountered several other smaller water sources en route that allowed us  to
refill. This was another hot day. After a long level traverse we  climbed  a
left slanting heather ramp to the bouldery SW shoulder of Triumph. From  the
shoulder we traversed some  more  under  "The  Great  White  Slab",  a  very
obvious feature on Triumph\'s SW face. We then climbed class 3 rock and  very
steep heather and grass (would be deadly slick  when  wet)  along  the  left
edge of the slab to a prominent broad right-slanting  bench  that  went  all
the way to a notch south of and about 250 ft below the summit. We  roped  up
here for an easy but wildly exposed  ledge  crossing  the  east  face  to  a
shallow gully. The gully started as  easy  heather  but  ended  in  a  steep
headwall with loose rock  that  was  difficult  to  protect.  Jim  led  this
section with essentially no  protection.   Once  up  the  headwall  a  short
narrow rib and final easy scramble put us on the summit (1900 ft 5:30 hrs).

On the summit I divulged  that  today  was  my  67th  birthday  and  that  I
couldn\'t think of a better way to spend it or a better birthday  present.  I
could not find any register other than a film can so far  down  a  crack  no
one could reach it. If it is an historic one it is probably just as well  as
that way no one can remove it.  But no way was I going to climb Triumph  and
not sign a register, especially on my birthday.  I  had  brought  one  along
"just in case". However,  we  shall  see  how  long  it  lasts  since  North
Cascades registers seem to have a very short life span. We spent an hour  on
the summit taking in the  views,  identifying  surrounding  peaks  and  just
generally enjoying ourselves.

One double and one  single  rope  rappel  got  us  back  to  the  notch.  We
downclimbed the bench, which seemed much scarier to me on the  way  down  as
it hung directly above the exposed Great White Slab. We did two more  double
and one single rappel alongside the slab to get below it  and  back  to  the
shoulder. Then came the long traverse, now mostly uphill, to arrive in  camp
just at dusk. Then it was party time.  Perhaps the less said about this  the
better.

Total: 4 miles, 2850 ft and 12 hrs.

Day 3: Sunday, September 13 - I  think  we  were  all  reluctant  to  leave.
Rarely do you have such great conditions for a climb - perfect weather  (not
even a morning dew), no bugs, and great companions. At the lake Kevin K  and
Jim took a swim to cool off. Eileen and I contented ourselves  with  dipping
both feet and head. But we all got hot and sweaty again as we made  our  way
up out of the lake basin and on down the  trail.  Once  in  Marblemount  for
nourishment it seemed on one could get enough of cooling drinks.

Total: 8 miles, 800 ft and 6 hrs.

Grand Total: 20 miles and 7900 ft in 3 days

Added Note - Garmin Testimonial: I  must  make  mention  that  on  the  last
rappel I dropped my Garmin Oregon GPS. I was not happy (understatement!)  as
I watched this very expensive piece of modern electronics bounce down  about
150 feet of (hard) rock and explode into several pieces. Now normally  I  am
paranoid about just such a thing happening  and  keep  everything  of  value
(camera, altimeter, GPS, etc) well tethered to me. But just this once I  had
put my GPS in the top  pocket  of  my  pack  thinking  it  would  be  better
protected there than on the outside even tethered.  Well it would have  been
had I then remembered to zip the pocket shut. When I twirled around  to  get
into the rappel out flew the GPS through the open pocket. But  here  is  the
remarkable thing. I managed to find the GPS below the bottom of the  rappel.
The back cover, the batteries and the micro SD map  card  were  all  missing
(that is what I saw exploding) but the main case was  intact  and  unbroken.
If that was remarkable in itself what was even more remarkable was  that  it
still worked. The route map for this TR was downloaded from it. Now  I  just
have to see if I can replace the back cover. Maybe if I tell this  story  to
Garmin they will do that for me. They sure make one rugged GPS.

P.S. Garmin did replace the back cover free of charge under the warranty.

(8030 ft - 510P) - Price Cr Quad - September 19-21, 2009

Day 1: Saturday, September 19 - Beefhide Butte - The forecast was  not  good
for Saturday. I wasn\'t sure what to expect but although it was raining  hard
going over Snoqualmie Pass by the time I reached the  East  Fork  Buttermilk
Cr TH (elev 4800  ft)  it  was  actually  sunny  and  warm.  It  had  rained
overnight, however, as the brush was wet. I followed the good trail for  5.5
miles to the 3rd crossing of the creek (nice forest camp here). Pleasant  XC
travel for a mile led  to  a  wonderful  camp  in  the  lovely  basin  below
Beefhide Butte, elev 6900 ft.  (6.5 miles, 2200 ft, 3:45 hrs).   During  the
hike in I could  feel  the  temperature  drop  as  a  predicted  cold  front
approached.

I hurriedly set up camp and started for Beefhide, only  1200  ft  above  me,
climbing talus and scree to the ridge. On the ridge I was  confronted  by  a
frigid wind, fog and deteriorating conditions. I made it along the ridge  to
the summit (where I found a pill bottle register  placed  by  Roy  McMurtrey
last year) before real weather hit. It began to snow while I was  descending
the talus to camp (1.5 miles, 1200 ft, 2:10 hrs RT). I quickly retreated  to
the comfort of my tent. I was glad I had brought my warmer sleeping bag.

Day 2: Sunday, September 20 - SÃ©ance Pk and Finney Pk - It froze during  the
night and was positively icy in the morning but the sun was shining and  the
sky blue. It took until 8:30 for me to warm up enough  to  get  going.  From
camp I worked my way up pleasant terrain to the saddle between Beefhide  and
SÃ©ance and followed the easy crest to the summit (1200 ft,  1:35  hrs)  from
where I had a great view of most of the Chelan-Sawtooth Top 100 peaks.  This
is lovely country especially this time of year  as  the  larches  were  just
starting to turn from green to gold. However, my view of Finney was  not  at
all encouraging. It was very far away and I worried if I  could  get  to  it
and back before dark from where I was camped.

I dropped off of SÃ©ance into gorgeous Bernice Lake  Basin  passing  by  both
that lake and a slightly lower tarn. I knew there was a way trail  from  the
main trail in the valley to the lake but the thought  of  dropping  all  the
way to 5600 ft was too depressing. And I really didn\'t know where the  trail
was. I thought I could save some elevation loss by crossing the ridge SW  of
the Lake and taking a higher traverse to hit the trail. I  would  have  done
better to just take the loss. I ended up on steep awful  loose  scree,  only
saved maybe 400 ft and lost time in the process. By the time I hit the  main
trail it was 1:00.

Once on the trail I moved rapidly, gaining back  all  the  elevation  I  had
lost. I took the trail to  Indianhead  Basin  at  the  next  junction.  This
section of trail is beautiful as it  traverses  meadow  after  meadow.  Just
below Indianhead Pass I left the  trail  and  traversed  heather  and  talus
below Pt 7985. The terrain was more rugged than I had anticipated  and  took
longer than I thought. Then as I got my first really good close up  look  at
Finney, my heart fell. This was no obvious walkup like Beefhide and  SÃ©ance.
The north face was one big cliff.  Maybe (ever the optimist) once I  reached
the N ridge an easy route would appear up the W side. It did not. I am  sure
there is an easy route up the S side but to  get  to  it  I  would  have  to
descend several hundred feet past the W face cliffs. I  simply  didn\'t  have
time for that. It was already 3:30.

The only possible route I saw from  where  I  was  on  the  N  ridge  was  a
ledge/gully that cut diagonally across the N face to a notch on  the  ridge.
Would it go? In fact it did go. In fact it  was  a  fun  interesting  route,
mostly class 3 with a few class 4 moves, that I thoroughly enjoyed.  But  it
was exposed over slabs. And the summit ridge was  even  more  exposed.  From
the notch there is an E and W summit. I couldn\'t tell which  was  higher  so
climbed them both but I left my register on the surveyed 8110  ft  E  summit
(3900 ft, 7:30 hrs).

It was now 4:30 and it was no longer a question of whether I would  make  it
back to camp before dark. The question was now just how long after  dark  it
would be. There was also the question of how the heck I would  actually  get
there. I could not retrace my down route from Bernice Lake.  In  addition  I
had a major ridge between me and the comfort of my tent and no easy  way  to
cross it. My hope was to find the way trail to Bernice Lake (even  though  I
wasn\'t sure where it was) and then cross the ridge  at  the  SÃ©ance-Beefhide
saddle.

Darkness caught me at the low point of the trail at the junction to  Boiling
Lake (elev 5600 ft). Luck was  with  me  though  and  somehow  I  found  the
unmarked trail to Bernice Lake a short ways farther on. This  made  all  the
difference. Without it I would either have wandered around  all  night  long
or had to bivy till first light. I easily followed  this  surprisingly  good
trail until it veered left toward the lake. I continued straight  up  toward
the ridge. Now I knew this ridge was cliffy in places.  It  was  pitch  dark
with no moon and I could see  nothing  outside  my  headlight  beam.  I  had
marked the low point of the saddle earlier in the day with  my  GPS  and  so
headed for that waypoint. I just hoped no cliffs were in the way. In fact  I
did have 100 feet of dicey steep stuff near the top but I managed to find  a
way through. Once on the ridge it was easy going down the other side  (as  I
knew it would be from my morning up route).  I  arrived  at  camp  at  10:30
tired but pleased I had made it (16 miles, 6400 ft, 14 hrs).

Day 3: Monday, September 21 - I slept in till the  sun  hit  my  tent.  Then
easily hiked out in 2:45 hrs.

Total: 29 miles and 9800 ft in 3 days

I tagged along on Jim and Eileen\'s trip  to  climb  Monument  and  Lake  but
since I had already done those peaks I planned to branch off on my  own  and
climb Three Pinnacles. This way I had the best of both worlds, good  company
on the approach and in camp in addition to a  new  peak.   Also  joining  us
were Steve and Lisa. It had been much too long since I  had  been  out  with
Steve. He is as entertaining as ever. It was my first time out with Lisa.  I
look forward to more trips with her.

Day 1: Thursday, September 24 - A long Day. The Monument Cr  trail  has  not
improved since I did it last in 2004. In fact  it  is  worse  now  that  the
bridge over Eureka Creek is gone. Traffic and maintenance  on  the  first  4
miles of trail has dwindled because of this. There  is  still  a  nice  camp
site at the confluence with the Lost River but it is on the  other  side  of
the creek which must be crossed by  wading.  Jim  gallantly  carried  Eileen
across to spare her prebandaged feet. I was kind of hoping that  his  duties
as leader of the trip would include carrying the rest of us  but  he  wasn\'t
of a like mind. Once past Eureka Cr there was no water available at  all  on
the hot dry steep ridge until reaching camp at Lake of the Woods, elev  6600
ft. Lisa, Steve and I arrived slightly before dusk. Jim and Eileen about  an
hour later.

Total: 12 miles, 5500 ft and 8:40 hrs.

Day 2: Friday, September 25 - Three Pinnacles - While Jim, Eileen, Lisa  and
Steve headed uphill to do Monument, I headed downhill for  Three  Pinnacles.
I followed the trail, quite good  in  this  section,  dropping  to  4600  ft
before leaving it where I easily crossed Monument Cr. From  there  I  worked
my way up easy terrain to a spur rib  leading  to  the  NW  ridge  of  Three
Pinnacles and along that ridge to the main North summit (3400 ft, 5 hrs).  I
had a fantastic view of all 8 Top 100 peaks in this area from Osceola Pk  to
Lost Pk. I continued on to the Middle Pinnacle (20 minutes from  N  Pk)  but
passed on the  South  one  due  to  lack  of  time  and  the  likelihood  of
encountering class 4 terrain. It did look like it would  be  fun  though.  I
returned to Monument Cr in 2.5 hours making it just  as  my  water  ran  out
(none available on the climb)  and  plodded  the  2000  feet  up  the  trail
dragging into camp at 6:40. Eileen and Steve were both  there  as  each  had
elected not to summit Monument. We three  spent  the  rest  of  the  evening
waiting and wondering when Jim and  Lisa  would  show  up.  They  thankfully
arrived at 9:10 guided by the beacon of our headlamps.  By  then  we  had  a
roaring campfire going and celebrated until midnight.

Total for me: 9 miles, 5800 ft and 10 hrs.

Day 3: Saturday, September 26 - Pistol Peaks -  We  all  went  our  separate
ways. Jim and Eileen left first to climb  Lake  Mtn.  Lisa  and  Steve  left
shortly after intending to go all the way out.  I left last to climb  Pistol
Peak on the way to a final camp at Eureka  where  I  was  to  meet  Jim  and
Eileen later. After climbing up to Pistol Pass, I  traversed  on  the  trail
until directly below the SE summit of Pistol Peaks where an easy spur  ridge
led to the top (1400 ft and 2 hrs RT from trail). The descent  of  the  rest
of the trail was without  incident  and  actually  took  less  time  than  I
thought it would even though sections of it were  hard  to  follow.  Several
times I had to pause to make sure I was on the  right  track,  but  I  never
really lost the trail. I arrived  at  lovely  Eureka  camp  with  plenty  of
daylight left to set up camp, wash-up and eat dinner. Jim and Eileen  showed
up at 7:45 just as it was getting dark. At one point  they  had  gotten  off
route and lost a good half hour in the brush.

Total: 9 miles, 2400 ft and 7 hrs (including Pistol Pk)

Day 5:  Sunday,  September  27  -  What  an  easy  day.  The  only  slightly
disagreeable part was the ford of Eureka Creek. Doing it first thing in  the
morning it was quite chilly. But that worked to my  advantage  as  my  feet,
which were quite battered by this time, were numb for most of the  trip  out
and I felt no pain. We all agreed that having this last camp  made  all  the
difference in ending a great trip on a pleasant note.

Total for the day: 4 miles, 450 ft and 1:50 hrs.

Grand Total for the trip: 34 miles and 14,150 ft in 4 days

Louis Pk (7787 ft - 507P) & Mt Gibbs (8142 ft - 1262P) - Gilbert  Quad;  and
Camels Hump (8015 ft - 655P) - Sun Mtn Quad - October 4-6, 2009

Remind me in the future that maybe it isn\'t so bad to spend 12  hours  in  a
sleeping bag.

Day 1: Sunday, October 4 - I approached via the South Creek and  Louis  Lake
Trails off the Twisp River Road. The day was sunny  and  warm  to  start.  I
even wore shorts to begin but that didn\'t last long. From  Louis  Lake  (5.2
miles, 2300 ft, 3 hrs) I went around the right side of the  lake  and  up  a
rock slide to frozen upper Louis Lake. Surrounded by  steep  cliffs  so  the
sun never shines in its depths this time of year and covered with  a  recent
dusting of an inch or so of snow, this upper basin,  though  beautiful,  was
not really very friendly. It is also filled with endless talus and I had  to
search hard to find a suitable spot to camp, which I did at 5:00, elev  5900
ft (6.7 miles, 3000 ft, 5:15 hrs). It was too cold to do anything  but  turn
in at 6:30 and snuggle in my warm sleeping bag.

Day 2: Monday (and Tuesday!), October 5 - Louis Pk  -  It  froze  hard  (low
20\'s) during the night and was positively frigid by  morning  but  after  12
hours in my sleeping bag I was  more  than  ready  to  get  up  despite  the
temperature. I didn\'t warm up until reaching the  tantalizing  sun  high  on
the south slope of Louis. I reached this summit at 10:00 (2000  ft,  2  hrs)
and found a plastic bottle register left  in  June  1989  by  Dallas  Kloke.
There were only 5 other entries, the most recent being that of  Stefan,  Jim
Brisbine and Mike Torok in May of 2004. This peak  isn\'t  climbed  all  that
often.

Mt Gibbs - I tried to follow the SW ridge off Louis but  it  was  too  rocky
and I was forced south into a loose  gully  until  I  could  traverse  below
cliffs to the Louis-Gibbs saddle. Easy terrain then led to  what  I  thought
was Gibbs summit. But the high point was  maybe  50  feet  farther  along  a
narrow ridge that I backed off of due to slick snow and  loose  boulders.  I
did an end run down to the left and back up again with a few class 4  moves.
This little detour cost me 30 minutes  (3500  ft,  4:30  hrs).  I  found  no
register.

Camels Hump - It was now 12:30 and too early to return to a camp  always  in
shadow. So I decided to  try  for  Camels  Hump.  Now  this  was  a  totally
unrealistic goal and I knew that at  a  minimum  I  would  be  returning  by
headlight. But I figured hiking in the moonlight was preferable  to  another
12 hours in my sleeping bag. How wrong I was. I kept  running  into  problem
after problem. First I had to cross the 7200 ft  Rennie-Gibbs  saddle.  From
Gibbs I descended endless talus to 6700 ft. Very slow and tedious.  I  swear
the entire Louis Creek Basin is filled with talus. There  is  not  a  single
decent meadow to be found. Then I climbed a gosh awful gully  (steep  frozen
dirt  topped  by  1.5  inches  of  powder  snow).  Fortunately  (or   maybe
unfortunately as it lured me on), at the saddle I was greeted  by  sunshine,
gorgeous friendly meadows and easy travel. The traverse  to  below  Reynolds
was an absolute delight.

The second problem was to get across Reynolds SW ridge, no  trivial  matter.
I tried not to lose too much elevation and found a crossing  in  the  cliffy
forest at 6800 ft but ran into dicey  snow  covered  class  3.  Turning  the
corner of the ridge, I got a close up view of  my  objective  and  my  third
problem. Camels Hump may be a walkup from  the  south  and  west,  but  from
where I was on the north side it was going  to  be  a  real  challenge.  The
upper part turned out to some 400 feet of class 3-4. A light  snow  covering
didn\'t help. Everything took much longer than expected. I watched  the  full
moon rise as I summited at 6:45 (5400 ft, 10:45). Again no register.

The return to camp is kind of a blur where time stood still. I  concentrated
on each segment at  hand.  I  breathed  a  sigh  of  relief  when  down  the
technical section of the Camels Hump. I took the  traverse  around  Reynolds
at a lower contour and avoided the unpleasant forested class 3. In the  open
meadows I hiked without headlamp by the light of the full moon  and  it  was
magical. The forming  frost  sparkled.  Then  the  magic  disappeared  as  I
descended the awful gully from the 7200 ft  saddle.  I  vaguely  remember  3
rappels and slithering down frozen snowy  dirt  on  my  seat  and  then  the
endless, endless talus. And just when I thought I was down, I  discovered  I
had another 500 feet of talus to go and I almost cried. I finally  staggered
into camp at 2:30 am (12  miles,  6600  ft,  18:30  hrs).  I  had  certainly
attained my goal of not spending another 12 hours in my sleeping bag  (which
was looking mighty good to me at that moment).

Day 3: Tuesday, October 6 - You can certainly understand why  I  didn\'t  get
up until 9:00 for the easy trip out. Surprisingly, though I had met  no  one
on the trail on Sunday, today I met 2 parties  hiking  to  Louis  Lake.  One
asked how much farther it was and seemed very disappointed when I told  them
they had a ways yet to go. They had no idea what a long  way  really  means!
(6.7 miles, 200 ft, 4:30 hrs)

Total: 25.4 miles and 9800 ft in 3 days

This was a delightful, mellow but COLD  3-day  loop  trip  in  the  southern
Chelan-Sawtooth at the height of golden larch season  shared  with  Jim  and
Eileen and Jim A. We started from the Summer Blossom TH  and  ended  at  the
South Navarre campground TH. Approach was via  the  Grade  Creek  road.  Our
thanks to Charlie Hickenbottom for reporting  from  his  July  trip  on  the
condition of this road. The road is in good shape but seems to take  forever
to drive the 40 miles from Chelan.

Day 1: Friday, October 9 - North Navarre and  Horsethief  -  What  with  the
long drive it was 12:15 before we started up the Summer Blossom Trail.  This
is a beautiful (hiker only) trail, especially this time  of  year  with  the
larches at their peak. It only took 2 hours to reach  the  summit  of  North
Navarre, a short distance  off  the  trail.  From  there  we  descended  and
traversed lovely terrain to a camp  in  an  east  arm  of  Horsethief  Basin
directly below Horsethief Pk where we were surprised  to  still  find  water
this late in the season. After setting up camp, Jim, Eileen  and  I  ran  up
the 1000 ft to the summit of Horsethief returning just before dark.  Already
we were feeling the effects of the predicted arctic  outbreak  of  the  next
few days. We had a very chilly dinner after  which  we  were  all  happy  to
retreat to the warmth of our sleeping bags.

Total: 6 miles, 3100 ft and 7 hrs

Day 2: Saturday, October 10 - Ferry and Uno - I awoke to  a  temperature  of
21 degrees and a heavy coating of frost inside my tent which contributed  to
a fast exit from camp. I don\'t think any of us warmed up until  we  hit  the
sun on the spur ridge above. Horsethief is  a  gorgeous  basin  and  we  all
reveled in the beautiful traverse to Deadmans Pass, where we looked down  on
stunning Sunset Basin. From Deadmans Pass  we  traversed  and  dropped  into
Miners Basin, attractive but not quite up to the very high standard  of  the
previous basins. At a trail junction (nice forest camp here) we  went  right
on the Uno Pk Trail about a mile to a hunter\'s camp  for  our  second  night
(4.5 miles, 1200 ft, 4 hrs). We had time to dry out tents and sleeping  bags
in the sun before Jim, Eileen and  I  set  off  for  Ferry.  After  climbing
Ferry, Eileen elected to return to camp while Jim and I  continued  to  Uno.
The arctic outbreak was now in full force and we could feel the  temperature
dropping. But by the time we returned to camp (4 miles, 2000 ft, 4:20  hrs),
again at dusk, Eileen and Jim A had a most welcome  fire  going  which  made
dinner a tolerable affair.

Day 3: Sunday, October 11 - South Navarre - Talk about cold! In the  morning
the temperature was 10 degrees and everything was frozen solid.  I  think  I
broke a record for packing up and being ready to go in an hour. It was  just
too cold to dally. Jim and I took off at 7:50  planning  to  pick  up  South
Navarre while Eileen and Jim A took their time coming  out.  We  hiked  with
all our clothes on and still never really got very warm  even  on  the  1300
foot climb up to South Navarre campground. As cold as it was I was  thankful
there was very little wind. Had there been any significant at all the  wind-
chill would have been well below zero degrees.

I reached the campground at 10:20 (5 miles, 1300 ft,  2:30  hrs)  where  Jim
was waiting. We dumped our big packs and zipped up the easy ridge  to  South
Navarre Pk (2 miles, 1500 ft, 2:15  hr  RT  with  30  minutes  on  top).  We
returned just as Eileen and Jim A were arriving. The  timing  couldn\'t  have
been better.

We survived the arctic weather and had a good  time  doing  it  but  I  sure
wouldn\'t have wanted it to be any colder.

Grand Total: 21.5 mile and 9100 ft in 3 days

This is another example of how chasing a peak list led to hidden  treasures.
Were it not for McLeod being on  the  Top  200  list  it,  and  those  peaks
nearby, would never even have been on my  radar  screen.  Riddled  with  old
logging roads, grazed everywhere by cattle  and  on  the  edge  but  not  in
wilderness, the area was still surprisingly attractive.

Tuesday, October 20 - McLeod Mtn: From Goat Cr Road 62 near Mazama, I  drove
spur 500 up Long Cr to a suitable car camp site below  the  south  ridge  of
McLeod, elev 5280 ft. Hunters were out in droves  cruising  the  back  roads
hoping, I guess, to spot a deer from the comfort of their vehicles as I  saw
no one on foot once I left mine.

I began in an old burn with many downed trees that slowed  travel  but  once
past that the scenery  was  lovely  with  open  woods,  meadows  and  golden
larches. The final summit ridge was gentle scree and  talus,  with  a  bench
mark on top (3.0 miles, 2900 ft, 2:40 hrs). I had fairly clear views of  the
Monument Creek peaks but fog obscured Sunrise Peak (8144  ft)  most  of  the
day. I could see far enough, though, to determine  my  original  thought  to
run the ridge north to  that  peak  was  not  practical.  I  would  have  to
approach it another way on another day.

Peak 7670: I returned to the saddle with  Peak  7670  to  climb  that  peak.
Following the NE ridge crest produced  some  fun  class  3  scrambling  with
impressive views down the cliffy north face. Just below the  summit  I  came
upon a large cairn with a rock slab painted with the elevation of  7640  ft.
Very strange. I had more fleeting thoughts of  running  the  ridge  west  to
Setting Sun Mtn, but again reason prevailed. It was too  far  away  for  the
time available, although it did look to be feasible (4 miles, 3500 ft,  4:20
hrs).

On the way down I took a line slightly east of  my  up  route  that  avoided
much the tedious downed burned trees section and arrived at the car at  6:00
where I spent a comfortable night (7 miles, 3500 ft, 6:30 hrs).

Wednesday, October 21 - Setting Sun Mtn: It  rained  during  the  night  and
though still drizzling in the morning it wasn\'t bad  enough  to  prevent  me
from trying Setting Sun. Back on the main Goat Cr Road,  I  took  Road  5255
(an excellent dirt road) and spur 600 to  the  saddle  south  of  the  peak,
elevation 5000 ft. I was pleased to see  the  way  began  in  open  pleasant
woods that would be no great problem in light rain  (which  soon  turned  to
light snow). In fact this  south  ridge  of  Setting  Sun  was  an  absolute
delight, even in the fog. I was compensated  near  the  top  for  having  no
views by an area of gorgeous rimed covered larch trees.  The  summit  is  an
old lookout site, which means there must have been a  trail  to  it  at  one
time. This is such a beautiful ridge I would have no problem returning  some
time in good weather for the views, particularly into the Lost River  Gorge.
Highly recommended as an easy trip for short  days.  (4.5  miles,  2900  ft,

Gray Peak (8082 ft - 402P - Oval Pk Quad) - October 27-28, 2009

I set out to see if  enough  snow  had  fallen  in  the  high  mountains  to
completely prevent  access.  With  only  a  small  window  of  good  weather
forecast I figured my best chance of success was in the Chelan-Sawtooth.  My
goal was to climb Gray Peak above Oval  lakes.  My  approach  was  from  the
Eagle Cr TH off the Twisp River Road.

Tuesday, October 27 - With only one really good day forecast  on  Wednesday,
I was happy that I also had reasonable weather for my  approach  on  Tuesday
with only the occasional snow shower and even some sun breaks. There  was  a
dusting of snow at the TH (3040 ft) with the depth  increasing  to  about  2
inches by the time I reached my campsite 6 miles in at 5800 feet along  Oval
Creek. Under the trees I found a mostly bare ground spot for my  tent.  With
plenty of warm clothing  along  I  spent  a  comfortable  night  despite  it
dropping to 19 degrees by morning. I must  be  getting  used  to  this  cold
weather camping business.

6 miles, 2900 ft and 4:20 hrs

Wednesday, October 28: Gray Peak - From my camp the trail  steadily  climbed
and the snow steadily increased in depth until I was breaking trail in  calf
deep powder as I entered lovely Oval Basin. Here I lost the trail.  As  much
work as this was the deep snow was preferable to  the  icy  windswept  rocks
and I sought out a continuous snow route to Gray\'s summit ridge where I  hit
welcome sun. Views were expansive from the summit (2.5 miles, 2400 ft,  2:40
hr) and I could see all three Oval Lakes. The snow made for a rapid  descent
and I was back in camp in a little over an hour. Lovely  as  the  area  was,
another storm was predicted  for  Thursday  and  I  didn\'t  want  to  chance
getting caught in it so I quickly packed up and zipped out reaching  my  car
at 4:00. I made it home before any new weather hit.

Total: 17 miles and 5400 ft in two days

 Wednesday, November 11: Big Hill and Crow Hill - I was very surprised I was able to drive up the Shady Pass Road as far as I did, 4.1 miles to Halfway Spring (elev 4680 ft). Actually I could have driven even farther but I have to be very conservative when alone on snowy back roads as I sure don\'t want to get stuck and I was satisfied with how high I got. Even though there was about a foot of snow it was fluffy powder and well tracked by other vehicles. Once underway on skis I met one big truck and two snowmobiles coming down, elk hunters all. I could tell they were shocked to run across a skier. I reached Shady Pass a little after 2:00 and set up a comfortable camp just out of sight of the road (4.5 miles, 1700 ft, 2:30 hrs). I was using my serious winter double wall tent with a built in vestibule. 
 Everything takes longer in the snow and cold so by the time I started for Crow Hill it was already 3:15. Now I knew I couldn\'t make it to the top before dark, but that was part of my plan. Much of the route was on road or trail and would be easy to navigate in the dark and I wanted to have something to occupy my time during the very long night. And in fact the skiing was easy and enjoyable on lovely powder. The truck unbelievable had made it all the way to Shady Pass and maybe Â¼ mile farther on the Big Hill road before being stopped by an impassible drift. The snowmobiles went another mile before turning around. From then on it was all untracked and gorgeous. Sunset caught me at the end of the road and start of trail. I needed my headlamp soon thereafter. I reached the summit of Crow Hill at 6:15 (4.5 miles, 1650 ft, 3 hrs). 
 I had some very nice downhill off Crow Hill. I really like skiing by headlamp and believe I can see as well as or better than in daylight. The only thing I missed was not having a view. I picked up Big Hill on the way out and discovered a very usable cabin on the summit. By the time I made it back to camp (9 miles, 2200 ft, 5:40 hrs), melted snow for water and had dinner I was pleased it was well past 10:00 and I had killed much of the night. 
 For today I followed the long gentle road to Crescent Hill. It was well tracked by snowmobiles but I never saw or even heard any (once the early starters were gone). From Crescent Hill I took the easy ridge to East Pt which provided some very pleasant untracked touring and nice views. I would have liked to have gone farther but I ran out of time. As it was I got back to camp at 3:15 (13 miles, 2100 ft, 6:40 hrs). I quickly broke camp and made it to my car just at dark. The ski down the road was enjoyable even with a full pack.

With another good two day forecast I figured I  could  still  access  fairly
high terrain in the Entiat for some interesting skiing. I don\'t really  like
to ski with a full pack but the approach was short and all on a well  graded
road.

Thursday, November 12: Crescent Hill and East Pt - I was  awakened  at  7:00
by two snowmobiles roaring past on the road. In my  experience  snowmobilers
are not early risers but these were really hunters and they are.  I  glanced
at my thermometer - 12 degrees inside my double wall tent!  That  translated
to single digits outside. And the inner wall of  my  tent  was  coated  with
frost so thick that when I got up it seemed like it was snowing inside.  For
a brief moment I questioned my sanity for putting myself  through  the  many
miseries of winter camping. Then the sun hit the tent and once warmed up  on
my way under blue sky it was all worth it again.

For today I followed the long gentle road to  Crescent  Hill.  It  was  well

I have often thought winter camping would be fun if only I  didn\'t  have  to
spend the night, especially this time of year when they  are  so  darn  long
and cold. I can\'t say my opinion has changed all that  much  but  there  are
just some places I can\'t get to on a day  trip  and   modern  equipment  has
made it all much  more  tolerable.  An  extra  warm  yet  still  lightweight
sleeping bag and head to toe down clothing wards off the chill  and  a  tiny
media player providing entertainment in the form of music and  videos  helps
the dark hours pass more quickly. Now I have to  justify  investing  in  all
this high tech gear by actually using it. (I  am  still  searching  for  the
perfect winter tent - freestanding with a vestibule and a  frost  liner  yet
still lightweight - but I haven\'t found it yet.)

Tuesday, December 1 - Slide Pk: I was delighted when I was able to  drive  6
miles up the Slide Ridge Road (8410) before  being  stopped  by  snow.   Big
rigs had gone farther but the depth was already about 1 foot and  I  worried
about getting stuck trying to get out of the track to turn around if I  went
any farther. Besides, I had gotten far enough to put  Stormy  Mtn,  my  main
objective, within reach. With the air temperature never having gotten  above
freezing, the snow was only crusty where directly hit by  the  sun  and  was
mostly powder and really quite good for  skiing.  The  wheeled  track  ended
after 3 miles and thereafter the road was marred only by  numerous  animals.
I was quite surprised there was  no  evidence  of  snowmobiles.  I  found  a
wonderful spot for my tent that caught both the morning  and  afternoon  sun
just above the saddle NE of Slide Pk (5 miles, 1600 ft, 3 hrs).

By the time I set up camp (everything takes longer in  the  winter)  it  was
dark, but a glorious full moon afforded enough light that I only  needed  my
headlight when in the shadows. I skied up Slide Pk to the sound of  Mozart\'s
wind concertos. It is other worldly skiing at night anyway but  add  a  full
moon and beautiful music and I was truly in another universe (3  miles,  600
ft, 2 hrs RT).  More music during dinner and an hour  video  viewed  in  the
depths of my sleeping bag passed the rest of the evening.

Wednesday, December 2 - Slide Ridge and Stormy Mtn: The  very  hardest  part
of winter camping for me is the  morning  and  having  to  force  myself  to
emerge from the warm cocoon of my sleeping bag  (It  was  12  degrees).  But
once that is accomplished I am good to go.  Sun  hitting  my  tent  at  8:00
helped. Lively Celtic music made the 6 mile road ski to  below  Slide  Ridge
fly by. I left the road to climb onto the ridge where the  skiing  was  very
nice indeed (1400 ft, 3:30 hrs). From the high point I skied  SW  along  the
ridge over a bump to the next saddle to pick up the summer trail leading  to
the summit ridge of Stormy Mtn. Skiing was good to  reasonable  up  to  this
point but once on the ridge it deteriorated to marginal.  Wind  had  scoured
much it down to bare ice. I guess it is called "Stormy"  for  a  reason.  At
least there was no wind this day (3000 ft, 6:20 hrs).   I  watched  the  sun
set and the moon rise as I started down but made it back to the road  before
needing my headlight (much of the way on the road was in the  moon  shadow).
Harp concertos accompanied me the 2 hours back to camp (17 miles,  3200  ft,
10 hrs).

Thursday, December 3: It was another cold morning - 9 degrees. The  sun  was
out for maybe an hour and then it clouded up but nothing came of it.  I  had
a pleasant ski out to the car (5 miles, 400  ft,  2:20  hrs)  and  an  early
drive home in the daylight. Total: 30 miles and 5800  ft  in  3  days.   Fay

Jumbo Mtn (5840+ ft - P1800 - Helena Ridge Quad) - December 27, 2009

Jumbo had been on my wish list for years - make that decades -  but  somehow
I just never got around to it. So when Paul Klenke organized a  trip  I  was
all for it.  Others along were Jeff R, Erin, Suzanne and Brie.  It  must  be
noted that this trip report is from the perspective  of  someone  always  in
the rear just following and trying to keep up with those younger and  faster
than I. I contributed nothing to  the  somewhat  complicated  route  finding
which was left to Paul (making good use of the excellent TR from  Franklin).


We departed from the Squire Cr TH at 7:15 just as the day began to  lighten.
The old road had a light layer of snow and was very icy and slick.  Once  on
the climber\'s trail,  though,  the  woods  were  completely  snow  free.  We
followed the trail and open woods to a talus slope,  crossed  and  traversed
steep woods to a snow filled gully at 3500 ft where we donned  crampons.  At
a 4300 ft rib  we  descended  slightly  and  traversed  below  cliffs  to  a
somewhat icy gully that got the adrenalin going.  Above  the  gully  was  an
open basin with several inches  of  powder  where  Erin  did  her  thing  by
kicking steps the rest of the way to the summit ridge. All day we  had  been
in shadow and here we finally hit welcome sun. Erin and I  guarded  Brie  to
make sure she stayed put, while the others climbed  the  final  pitch  along
the narrow ridge with Paul setting a hand line on the most exposed  section.
Brie was not happy being separated from  her  master.  Once  Paul  returned,
Erin and I made the short  trek  to  the  top,  locating  the  register  and
signing in.

We made several fast glissades down to the basin. On the  last  one,  trying
to find a better line, we went a different way from our up route  and  ended
up on a very steep slope. The top  was  too  steep  (at  least  for  me)  to
glissade until I front pointed down a bit first. We were  all  down  and  at
the bottom when Paul realized that Brie didn\'t think much of our  choice  of
route and was stranded at the top whining and refusing to come  down.   This
was not good although personally  I  think  it  just  proves  Brie  is  more
intelligent with better sense than any of us.  It  was  awfully  steep.  She
would not come down without help. Anxious to get the icy gully  out  of  the
way, we three gals started down it while the two  guys  set  about  rescuing
Brie. They had to climb all the way back up to her and  rope  her  down.  We
waited for them at the rib.

Darkness caught us about an hour from the car. We  kept  losing  the  trail,
crashing brush and climbing over countless  logs.  Brie  was  absolutely  no
help in finding the trail. I thought  dogs  were  supposed  to  be  good  at
sniffing out the proper way. But she was probably still traumatized  by  her
little incident and tired from having gone twice as far as we did.  To  make
matters worse, my headlamp began to die and I had  trouble  seeing  where  I
was going. I did have two more with me but as  luck  would  have  it  I  had
grabbed the one with the weakest batteries. I could have stopped and  gotten
another one out of my pack  but  by  the  time  I  did  that  I  would  have
completely lost sight of everyone else. Erin, bless her, hung back a bit  to
help keep me on track. Just as my headlamp became almost completely  useless
we hit the road. Not a moment too soon as far as I  was  concerned.  It  was
questionable who was more tired, Brie or me.

Bald Mtn (5481 ft - P1241 - Glacier Quad) - January 3, 2010

Bald Mtn is an impressive rocky  little  peak  directly  north  of  Glacier.
Stefan planned to climb  this  peak  on  this  same  day  but  was  starting
directly from Hwy 542 at the low elevation of 800  ft.  Since  the  snowline
was still quite high that meant walking bare  logging  roads  for  miles.  I
declined to join him as I  really  wanted  to  ski  and  not  hike.  Then  I
discovered the night before that I could drive to 3400 ft via the Canyon  Cr
road which would get me to snow and close enough for a day ski  trip.  So  I
knew Stefan would be on the peak but he didn\'t know I would be. What a  kick
it would be if we met on the summit.

Although I could drive close enough to get near  the  peak  I  still  wasn\'t
sure I could climb it on skis as the final 800 ft or so are quite steep  and
rocky. It turned out to be a delightful ski trip and I was able to  get  all
the way to the summit on skis. I began at 3400 ft on road 3140. The  driving
was not too bad although icy in spots and I stopped before  it  became  more
so. The hard core 4X4ers had only gotten a quarter mile or so  father  so  I
didn\'t do too badly. From there a lone snowmobile track took over.  Although
a designated snowmobile route this road doesn\'t seem to be overly  used  and
none came up on this Sunday. Maybe there isn\'t enough snow yet.

Starting at 9:30, I skied the road  about  3  miles,  rapidly  getting  into
fresh snow, to an untracked spur heading toward Bald Lake. This was kind  of
out of my way. I had hoped to take a short cut directly to the lake but  old
roads shown on the map were now nonexistent and the terrain  was  too  steep
and dense for XC travel. I had to stick to the main roads.  The  spur  ended
in a clear-cut not too far from the lake but it was still an effort to  find
a way XC. Once at the lake the terrain opened up and the skiing  was  great.
I skirted the lake, traversed under cliffs and made my way to  a  5000  foot
saddle. On the other side was a lovely basin beneath the cliffs of the  west
face of Bald. Here was the crux. I had to get past  these  cliffs.  As  luck
would have it an open slope led to the west ridge. It was quite  steep  near
the top but doable on skis.

Just as I topped the steep slope onto the west ridge who should I  run  into
but Stefan and Greg coming down. What timing. One more minute  and  I  would
have missed them completely. I think I really surprised them. It  was  great
fun seeing them. The rest of the way  to  the  summit  was  along  a  gentle
ridge. I ate lunch while enjoying  a  panorama  view  on  a  day  where  the
weather turned out much better than expected. I then ended with a  wonderful
ski down reaching the car while it was still daylight.

Total: 9 miles, 2600 ft and 7 hrs

Lookout Mtn (6188 ft - P828 - Mt Clifty Quad) - January 6-7, 2010

Wednesday, January 6 - When the skiing is less than ideal, and I still  want
to ski, I turn to groomed snowmobile roads. Conditions  have  to  be  really
bad to make even these roads unskiable. Well, they were really bad  for  the
start of this trip. When I arrived at the Woods and Steel Snopark  near  Cle
Elum, the road had not been groomed and not a single snowmobile had been  up
it since it had been coated with layer of  freezing  rain.  For  a  fleeting
moment I considered aborting the whole trip, but  instead  I  plunged  ahead
optimistically thinking things had to get better higher  up.  They  did  but
only marginally. When I hit South Cle Elum Ridge at 5  miles,  the  freezing
rain crust had turned to just a simple crust formed  from  being  rained  on
and then freezing. Semantics? Not really! Freezing rain is a very  different
and absolutely horrible beast. Anyway, the  crust  was  now  very  thin  and
actually had soft snow underneath so was fairly skiable.  I skied another  4
miles along the ridge stopping at 4:15 with just enough light to  set  up  a
camp on the saddle south of Hicks Butte.  9 miles, 3300 ft and 5 hrs.

Thursday, January 7 - It was windy all night and 15 degrees when I  woke  at
7:30. I had experimented with adapting a vestibule from the Hilight tent  to
fit my Oneshot (none is  made  for  the  Oneshot).  It  worked  quite  well,
withstanding the winds and giving me a  roomy  space  to  cook  and  put  on
boots. But it was an effort to rig. I would prefer a tent with  a  built  in
vestibule and I continue to search for the perfect winter abode.

Starting at 8:30 in my down parka as a  shield  against  the  bitterly  cold
wind, I skied another 3.5 miles to end of a road and then onto the ridge  to
pick up the trail to Windy Pass. Skiing along the trail, although tricky  in
spots, was better than I would have thought and not too bad in  open  areas.
It was worst in the trees where it was quite icy. Once leaving the trail,  I
was able to ski about halfway along the ridge to Lookout before  leaving  my
skis. I could have skied more but I didn\'t want to carry them past  a  short
rocky bump. So I booted the rest of the way to the  summit  reaching  it  at
11:45. I was greeted by a stunning view of Mt Stuart floating  like  a  ship
on an ocean of clouds.

Skiing was reasonable on the way down and got even better when  I  got  back
to the main road and was  passed  by  three  snowmobiles.  I  am  sure  they
wondered who the heck was this lone skier miles from nowhere and  where  had
she come from. Their tracks broke up the crust to the soft snow  underneath.
I was back in camp at 2:00 (10 miles, 2200 ft, 5:30 hrs RT)  and  packed  up
and ready to go at 3:00. Only 9 miles left to go (sigh)!

I actually enjoyed the skiing along the gentle road back to where it  leaves
the ridge. But I dreaded the descent from there on. I hoped the  snowmobiles
had gone that way and broken up the freezing  rain  crust.  When  I  reached
that point much to my delight the road had been groomed since I came  up.  I
was saved. That is not to say it was a piece of cake  getting  down  it.  It
was still very fast and slick but  at  least  it  was  smooth  and  I  could
snowplow it. Otherwise I might have had to walk down. And,  of  course,  now
it was dark. And after 5 miles of snowplowing my legs were trashed.  When  I
reached the car at 6:15 I could barely walk. (9  miles,  550  ft,  3:15  hrs
from camp)

Pemmican Pk (5442 ft- P402 - Bedal Quad) - January 10, 2010

Pemmican is a modest little peak west of and overshadowed  by  Stillaguamish
Pk. It is rather difficult of  access,  guarded  on  most  sides  by  brushy
cliffs. The easiest approach is from high on the Perry Cr  Trail,  but  even
that is not straightforward, involving a long convoluted traverse  past  the
many ridges of Stillaguamish.

I was able to drive all the way to the Perry Cr TH (2200 ft) and  the  trail
was completely snow free until about 3000 ft. Thereafter  it  had  icy  snow
but was still easily followed to the big switchback at 4300 ft. Here I  left
the trail and headed straight uphill. I had to go all the way to  the  ridge
to get past a major gully and avoid cliffs. Up till now the  snow  had  been
hard and icy but above about 4500 ft I began potholing in slush or  annoying
breakable crust. Then began a seemingly endless traverse past  Stillaguamish
Pk with many obstacles and ups and downs. It was farther,  harder  and  took
longer than one would think looking on the map. Just when I  thought  I  had
it made another difficulty would appear. I had to descend more than  800  ft
total to finally be able to make my  way  to  the  5000  ft  saddle  between
Stillaguamish and Pemmican. Once there easy slopes led to  the  summit  (5.5
mile, 4200 ft, 5:30 hrs).

I know Jim Brisbine and Steve Fox climbed this  peak  a  few  years  ago.  I
don\'t recall many details from that TR but I do remember they went  straight
down to Perry creek on what Jim described as a descent from Hell. With  that
in mind I had intended to return the same way as I had come.  But  that  was
before I had come that long and convoluted way. I now see why Jim and  Steve
had elected to go straight down. It was less  than  half  the  distance  and
very direct and so very very tempting. Neither prospect was very  appealing.
But I just couldn\'t face potholing all the way back up that traverse.  So  I
just kind of let gravity pull me downward.

Jim was right. It was the descent from Hell. I had looked at the route  from
the trail in the morning. There were two major gullies with waterfalls  that
had to be avoided at all costs and cliffs all over the place.  But  an  open
avalanche track with broken trees to the west  looked  almost  feasible  and
that is what I headed for. I ended up right where I wanted  to  be  on  this
avalanche slope but just because I was where I wanted to be didn\'t  mean  it
was very good. I picked my way through a jungle of downed  trees,  slithered
down mossy cliffs hanging onto bush belays and crashed brush  in  the  trees
lower down.  I completely tore out the seat of  my  climbing  pants  in  the
process. There were times I really didn\'t know how  to  proceed  as  nothing
looked any good. The final 1000 feet were the worst. I did avoid  all  major
cliffs and find scramble routes down the small ones for all but one where  I
had to break out my panic rope. The one bright spot was that when I came  to
Perry Cr I found a huge log that even I could walk.

Breccia Pk (6487 ft - P1047) and Spring Mtn (5770 ft  -  P450)  -  Sloan  Pk
Quad - January 21-22, 2010

With skiing still lousy, I perused Dallas Kloke\'s Winter Climbs book  for  a
possible new climb doable this time of year and  came  across  the  somewhat
obscure Spring Mtn.  Two good weather days  were  forecast  and  wanting  to
make the most of this opportunity, I figured that with  a  camp  at  Bingley
Gap I could also add Breccia to the itinerary.

Thursday, January 21: Spring Mtn - The North Fork Sauk Road 49 was  open  to
the Lost Creek Ridge TH (elev 1849 ft). The trail itself was in  good  shape
with only a couple of blow downs and was snow  free  to  about  3400  ft.  I
crossed the two snow filled avalanche gullies  mentioned  in  Kloke\'s  route
description and continued on to Bingley Gap crossing  a  couple  more  minor
gullies on the way. I soon  lost  the  trail  in  steep  icy  terrain  where
crampons were helpful. I found a level bench (elev 4300  ft)  a  short  ways
down the other side of the gap out of the wind  for  a  comfortable  if  not
particularly scenic camp (3.5 miles, 2650 ft, 3.5 hrs).

I left for Spring Mtn at 3:30 hoping to make the top before dark.  As  usual
it was farther and took longer than anticipated. Since I wasn\'t  approaching
from the avalanche gully on the south as  recommended  by  Kloke,  but  from
Bingley Gap, I had to drop on the north side to get  past  cliffs  before  I
could gain the east ridge. I then started (too  soon)  up  the  first  gully
that looked like it would go. It did but it also got very steep at  the  top
with a sporting partially filled rotten moat to  cross.  Once  on  the  open
ridge it was pretty straight forward, just long and slow trail breaking.  It
was also quite windy. I had a few impressive glimpses  of  Mt  Pugh  in  the
twilight, but by the time I reached the summit at 7:00 all was dark.   Going
down was much faster, my tracks easily  followed  by  headlight.  I  took  a
better gully down off the ridge and reached camp at 8:30 (3 miles, 2100  ft,
5 hrs RT). I was pleased that by the time I turned in it was after 10:00.

That night was positively balmy for January. It barely  got  below  freezing
and was the warmest night I have spent out since summer. I am  not  sure  it
even qualifies as winter camping.

Friday, January 22: Breccia Pk - I didn\'t get going  as  early  as  I  would
have liked. The day dawned overcast and being camped in the woods in a  dark
double walled tent I didn\'t even notice it was getting light until  7:45.  I
started out at 9:00 in crampons and  kept  them  on  all  day.  The  initial
wooded ridge to 5500 ft was quite icy. Then started  a  long  open  traverse
around three bumps on Lost Creek Ridge. Conditions  varied  from  calf  deep
powder to breakable crust to hard crust to windswept  ice,  entirely  doable
without snowshoes but inconsistent and quite tiring  trail  breaking  alone.
Once around the last point (Pt 5920) and at the saddle above  Sunup  Lake  I
climbed to Breccia\'s summit ridge which I hit to the right of a  small  bump
(Pt 6360). Here I made the error of dropping off the  ridge  into  the  east
basin and traversing very steep slopes to regain the summit ridge past  this
point. From where I was initially it  appeared  the  ridge  was  dangerously
corniced and would be treacherous. Once on the summit I  saw  this  was  not
the case. I easily returned along this ridge.

I reached the summit at 1:30. Up to now the day  had  been  mostly  overcast
with that flat winter light that doesn\'t make for the best photography.  But
now the sun began making an appearance and I reaped the  reward  of  a  late
start and slow pace. The views were breathtaking. I spent  a  glorious  half
hour savoring them. It wasn\'t even windy.  Unknown to  me  at  the  time,  a
group of friends were climbing Red Mtn (directly across Lost Creek) on  this
very day. Had I know I would have looked for them on that  summit,  although
they got a much earlier start and were probably already gone.

The return in my broken trail was much faster, despite  numerous  stops  for
added pictures. I reached camp at 4:00 (5 miles, 2200 ft,  7  hrs  RT),  and
left at 4:30. The hardest part of the whole trip was  the  first  1000  down
from Bingley gap.  The  snow  was  rock  hard,  very  steep  (crampons  were
essential) and the tendency without benefit of a trail to guide  you  is  to
head straight down whereas you really need to traverse right. I got too  low
and had to climb back up to cross a gully to get back on track.  I  breathed
a sigh of relief when I hit discernable trail in fading light. The rest  was
easy as I ambled down the trail enjoying the night sounds.   I  reached  the
car at 7:00.

Total: 15 miles and 7000 ft in 2 days

Ever since seeing Grant Myers\' pictures of  Grouse  Ridge  from  his  TR  of
November 2008 I have wanted to ski to this area. I was just waiting for  the
proper combination of good weather and good conditions. After  hearing  that
Mt Baker had received over a foot  of  new  snow  Sunday  into  Monday  with
clearing predicted Tuesday and Wednesday, the time seemed right.

Tuesday, January 26: Lookout Mtn N &  S  Pks  -  Due  to  a  generally  high
snowline this year, I figured I would be able to  drive  the  Glacier  Creek
Road 39 quite a ways, but I was still surprised to get to 3500 ft  (Road  36
junction about 7.5 miles in). There were  several  snowmobile  rigs  already
parked and both Roads 39 and 36 were well tracked. I  quickly  skied  gentle
Road 36 to the junction with the road up Lookout Mtn. My original  plan  was
to camp in the broad saddle to the south (elev 4200 ft), but I got there  so
quickly and the day was so nice (at least to start) that I decided I  wanted
a view with my camp so I continued to the  summit  of  S  Lookout  Mtn  (4.5
miles, 1600 ft, 2:30 hrs). Well, I had a partial view for all of  5  minutes
before a weak unpredicted  weather  system  came  in,  the  view  completely
disappeared and by the time I set up my tent it had  begun  to  snow.  Darn!
Where did this come from? I guess the weather gods didn\'t pay any  attention
to the weathermen. I was glad I had  brought  my  Hilleberg  tent  with  its
roomy vestibule.

The turn of the weather didn\'t deter me from going  for  N  Lookout  Mtn.  I
found a delightful open slope with excellent snow to ski down to the  saddle
between the two peaks. From there a short clear-cut and wooded ridge led  to
the summit, all very skiable. By now it had  quit  snowing  (it  had  snowed
maybe an inch total) and was beginning to clear a  bit  and  I  returned  to
camp by the light of a hazy moon (2.5 miles, 1000 ft, 2:30 hrs RT).

Wednesday, January 27: Grouse Ridge and Pk 5365  -  I  awoke  to  completely
clear and cold (18 degrees) skies with a heavy frost. It was colder  than  I
expected but I did have my view. In taking my morning  photos (I  had  taken
none the previous day - too cloudy) I realized I hadn\'t replaced the  memory
card in my camera after downloading pictures onto my computer from  my  last
trip. It seems I always forget something. So all I had to work with was  the
built in memory of the camera (which is only good for a dozen or  so  photos
depending on resolution chosen) and I had to  be  more  discriminating  than
usual in choosing before clicking away.

I skied  west  from  camp  along  more  delightful  terrain  (despite  being
somewhat tracked by snowmobiles) before working my  way  down  to  the  road
heading toward Grouse Butte.  I  followed  this  road  to  its  end.  I  had
expected to find a snowmobile track continuing on to the basin below  Grouse
Ridge but all tracks ended here. I  soon  found  out  why.  A  steep,  thick
second growth side hill and an open stream cut had to be  negotiated  before
hitting easy open forest. With no other tracks in sight I was  beginning  to
think I would have the area unspoiled and all to myself. But when I  reached
the open basin,  much  to  my  dismay  I  found  it  completely  tracked  by
snowmobiles, so much so that it was rendered almost unskiable. How the  heck
did they get here? They certainly didn\'t come the way I had.  I  later  came
to believe they had come up from the end of the  Mt  Baker  Vista  Road.  At
least no snowmobiles were there while I was. In fact I saw and heard no  one
all day, so I did have the area all to myself. And the tracks  were  only  a
visual eyesore and did not really affect the  quality  of  my  skiing  as  I
didn\'t ski down that way.

I gained the ridge at a col and was  greeted  with  a  spectacular  view  of
Baker, Colfax and Lincoln. Lincoln  looked  particularly  ominous  with  its
fresh mantle of snow and ice. The flat ridge itself was  windy  and  icy.  I
quickly went to the high point and found a sunny protected spot  for  lunch.
Then I skied down the untracked north ridge. It was really  quite  good.  My
plan was to continue to Pk 5365. I had to go through two narrow notches  and
around Pt 5334 but it was all on very  interesting,  very  skiable  terrain.
The first notch is where I ran across snowmobile tracks coming up  from  the
north and presumably the Mt Baker Vista Road. At  the  second  notch  I  ran
into ski tracks. Evidently the steep open east slopes of Pk 5365 are  sought
after by the downhillers. They did look very nice and an approach  from  the
Vista road would make for a very pleasant day  trip.  I  saw  no  snowmobile
tracks on these slopes.

From the summit of Pk 5365 I continued north along the gentle ridge  to  the
first saddle and an absolutely sublime slope with perfect snow  and  perfect
steepness. It just doesn\'t get any better. It was lightly tracked  by  other
skiers. Unfortunately the best slope of the trip was followed by the  worst.
No tracks went below the open slope. I was on my own in getting back to  the
Grouse Butte road below. It would have been better in a  heavier  snow  year
with more coverage of obstacles. As it was I managed to stay on skies  until
I was funneled into a gully and couldn\'t avoid crossing a running  creek  on
a log. I had to remove skis for that. But once past that I came  to  an  old
clear-cut and found a reasonable route the rest  of  the  way  down  to  the
road. Would you believe this road had been freshly groomed  sometime  during
the day? I never cease to be  amazed  at  how  often  snowmobile  roads  are
groomed.

I now paid dearly for my desire for a camp with a  view  as  I  climbed  800
feet up my tent. Whose brilliant idea was this anyway? It had clouded  up  a
bit again so I never did have a sunny view from camp. I reached it at  4:45,
quickly packed up and left at 5:25. I skied down the gentle and now  groomed
road by headlight. The only tracks on the groomed road were those of a  lone
skate skier. There were none by any snowmobiles.

Total for day: 15 miles, 3800 ft and 10 hrs.

Total for trip: 22 miles and 6400 ft in 2 days

Skyline Divide (6560+ ft - P200 - Mt Baker Quad) - February 3-4, 2010

I had seen Chowder Ridge last week  from  Grouse  Ridge  and  it  looked  so
appealing I had to give it a try. Even though I never  made  it  to  Chowder
Ridge proper, the trip along Skyline  Divide  was  so  exquisite,  I  didn\'t
really care.  This is one gorgeous  ridge  in  the  winter  with  reasonably
friendly ski terrain. It combined two of my favorite things in life,  skiing
and ridges. I was in heaven. It being in the Mt Baker  Wilderness  I  wasn\'t
bothered by snowmobiles - or anyone else for that matter. It is not a  usual
destination for skiers and so I had miles and miles of completely  untracked
snow all to myself. I also hit perfect weather and snow conditions.

Wednesday, February 3 -  On  a  continuing  theme,  this  winter  of  little
lowland snow allowed me to drive Rd 37 some 10 miles  to  3360  ft  where  a
snow berm stopped all traffic. That left 2.5 miles to ski along the road  to
the Skyline Divide TH at 4360 ft. I was able to ski up  the  trail  but  the
snow cover was thin in the trees to begin and I knew I  would  have  trouble
skiing down the lower section. As the trail opened up higher  up,  the  snow
depth increased and skiing was quite good. There was 4-5 inches  of  new.  I
started under sunny skies but the day soon clouded over and  then  it  began
to snow lightly. This  was  forecast  and  not  unexpected.  The  next  day,
however, was supposed to be nice. I  just  hoped  it  was.  When  I  reached
Skyline Divide it was snowing and blowing and I sought a protected  spot  in
the trees below the ridge to camp (4.5 miles, 2700 ft, 4:30 hrs).

Thursday, February 4 - It snowed more during the night and got  down  to  25
degrees. I didn\'t know what would greet me in the morning until I  poked  my
head out of the tent at  first  light  -  it  was  clear  and  windless.  It
couldn\'t have been better. I had climbed Hadley Pk years ago in  the  summer
on a day trip. I vaguely remember Skyline Divide being a  very  long  ridge.
It is - very long, especially with no trail to  follow.  But  it  makes  for
splendid skiing - at least the kind of skiing I like. I followed  the  ridge
up and down for miles over varied and interesting terrain. The  only  slight
difficulties were a steep traverse to get  around  Pt  6160  and  one  short
vertical cornice where I had to take off skis to get up onto  Pt  6560  (the
high point of the divide).  Views were everywhere.

I continued on the ridge as far I could ski climbing  up  a  shadowed  north
facing bowl (a fantastic run back down)  to  a  saddle  on  the  NW  end  of
Chowder Ridge. I had hoped to get up onto that  ridge  itself  but  a  steep
rocky step prevented me access.  Besides  I  was  running  out  of  time.  I
contented myself with a small bump (Pt 6640)  above  the  saddle  (4  miles,
1800 ft, 4:30 hrs). It was probably a good thing I could go no farther or  I
would have continued past the point of prudence. I just didn\'t  want  it  to
end. My consolation was the ski out was just as good as the ski in.

I reached my tent at 3:30 (8 miles, 2600 ft, 7:30 hrs),  left  at  4:00  and
arrived at the car at 6:00. I did have to walk  at  last  Â½  mile  down  the
trail to the road.

Total: 17 miles and 5300 ft in 2 days

Fourmile Ridge (7128 ft - P1288), Devils  Backbone  (6709  ft  -  P429)  and
Angle Pk (6720+ ft - P0) - Brief Quad - February 10-11, 2010

With an iffy forecast I went  east  looking  for  better  weather  and  snow
conditions. I didn\'t do that well in either category  but  it  was  still  a
satisfying ski trip. It probably would have been better for  3  days  as  it
took much longer than anticipated, partially due to  conditions  but  mostly
because I had to ski  the  entire  access  road  starting  from  the  Entiat
Valley.  Unlike  the  west  side  the  east  side  snowline  appears  to  be
relatively low although still of below average depth.

Wednesday, February 10 - I started from the  Entiat  Valley  a  little  past
Brief (elev 1760 ft), skiing the road that goes up Preston Cr. The road  had
continuous crusty snow and was rutted by  snowmobile  tracks.  The  day  was
overcast with good visibility to begin. At 2 miles I took a  left  onto  the
road that goes to Brennegan Cr. No recent snowmobiles had been this way.  As
I got higher a light dusting of  fresh  snow  covered  the  crust.  I  found
myself hoping for more fresh  snow  overnight  or  the  ski  down  would  be
trying. After another 2 miles I took a right at  a  junction  skiing  around
the headwater branches of the creek and onto a gentle forested  ridge  where
I found a flat spot to camp at 4400 ft (7.5 miles, 2800 ft,  4:45  hrs).  It
began to snow lightly as I put up my tent and was barely below freezing.

Thursday, February 11 - Much to my disappointment it  snowed  less  than  an
inch overnight, barely enough for any improvement. If I was  going  to  have
fog and no views at least I  should  have  good  snow.  I  skied  along  the
forested ridge, at first on an old road,  until  it  broke  out  below  open
slopes. Under different circumstances, i.e. more fresh  snow,  skiing  would
have been very good here but a hard crust covered by a couple inches of  new
made for very slippery going. I  could  have  used  ski  crampons,  which  I
didn\'t have.  As the slope steepened I sought better conditions on the  spur
ridge to the left. Once  on  this  things  improved  a  bit.  They  improved
greatly on the forested main ridge to Angle Pk where skiing was very nice.

From Angle Pk I followed the  ridge  east  to  Devils  Backbone.  The  first
section was open, narrow  and  corniced  and  made  for  some  tricky  spots
especially since now it was snowing again and visibility  was  nil.  Several
times I skied off small drops simply because I had no depth  perception  and
couldn\'t see them. The final forested rise to  the  summit  was  again  good
skiing. The way back was easier since I had my tracks to guide me.

I went over Angle Pk again (I am not sure why this insignificant bump has  a
name as it has no prominence. Maybe because it is the  intersection  of  two
major ridges.) and continued west to  the  high  point  of  Fourmile  Ridge.
Again skiing was excellent along the gentle wooded  ridge  until  I  had  to
make a steep traverse around Pt 7102. On the way I got a brief distant  view
and had hopes the weather might clear. No such luck. By the time  I  reached
the summit of Fourmile it was snowing and blowing harder than  ever.  I  had
thought to find a more direct way down but with  no  visibility  I  couldn\'t
chance it and followed my tracks back to the flat Fourmile-Angle  saddle.  I
had some pleasant downhill along the ridge and onto  the  upper  spur  ridge
until I hit the steep. This time I elected to descend the  drainage  to  the
west. Although by now there was 3-4 inches of fresh snow  it  wasn\'t  bonded
enough to the crust underneath for me to do telemarks with  my  skill  level
and light gear. However it was perfect for slideslipping, which  I  did  for
the next 1000 ft. It worked very well and was really quite  fun.  The  slope
moderated and I entered forest again before hitting the road  about  a  mile
from camp.

Dragging into camp at 6:30 (10.5 miles, 4200  ft,  10.5  hrs)  I  considered
staying another night. It was very tempting but as bad as it was to pack  up
in the snow it would be worse to pack up in the  rain.  It  was  already  32
degrees here and the snow level was predicted  to  rise  during  the  night.
There was enough fresh snow on the road to make the ski  down  pleasant  for
the most part, that is except for the  last  mile.  A  combination  of  deep
ruts, mixed rain and wet snow and rubbery legs made for  anything  but  (7.5
miles, 200 ft, 3 hrs to the car).

Total: 25.5 miles and 7200 ft in 2 days

I have always wanted to ski to Coleman Pinnacle on  a  multi-day  trip,  but
getting  there  requires  perfect  weather,  good  snow  and   very   stable
conditions, usually a rare combination. I was just  never  able  to  hit  it
right when I had time available, that is until now.

Thursday, February 18: Ptarmigan Ridge -  The  fresh  snow  of  Tuesday  was
still evident when I left the Mt Baker Ski Area parking lot at noon. It  was
preserved as delicious powder on all aspects  where  the  sun  did  not  hit
directly. On those where  it  did  a  crust  had  already  formed  that  was
beginning to soften in the heat of the afternoon. Skiing was quite  good  to
Artist Point. From there I dropped 200 feet to traverse below the  cliff  of
Table Mtn and then climb  to  the  5080  ft  saddle  with  Ptarmigan  Ridge.
Another short drop was required from the saddle before it  was  possible  to
climb the  gentle  slopes  onto  broad  Ptarmigan  Ridge.  Finding  a  semi-
protected spot to pitch my tent on this  scenic  but  very  weather  exposed
ridge took a bit of searching around. It was not windy at  that  moment  but
should it kick up at any time a  camp  here  would  be  very  vulnerable  (4
miles, 1500 ft, 3 hrs).

Once my camp was in order, I started for the high  point  of  the  ridge  at
4:00 up SW facing slopes. These were still in the sun and soft, but as  soon
as I rounded a corner onto a SE slope I  entered  shade  and  the  snow  had
already refrozen to a hard crust. I had  anticipated  conditions  like  this
and brought along ski crampons which helped greatly  traversing  around  the
false summit. The summit itself was still in sunshine and  I  took  time  to
enjoy the both the warmth and lovely evening views. Of course by the time  I
started down most all was in shade and made for a slick return  to  camp  (2
miles, 400 ft, 2 hrs RT).

Friday, February 19: Coleman Pinnacle, Pk 6527 and  Lasiocarpa  Ridge  -  It
dropped to 18 degrees  overnight  but  open  vents  and  a  constant  breeze
prevented any frost condensation inside my tent.  The  sun  hit  my  camp  a
little before 8:00 warming things  quickly  and  making  for  a  comfortable
start to the day. I followed the ridge SW beginning  with  ski  crampons  in
addition to skins as the snow had not yet softened in the sun.  The  terrain
was gentle enough that travel was easy. At the next saddle in  the  ridge  I
had thought to drop off the crest onto the NW slope where I  knew  the  snow
would be powder, but cornices prevented any easy escape. I couldn\'t get  off
the ridge.

I continued traversing around Pt 5831 on S slopes rounding a corner  for  my
first close-up view of Coleman  Pinnacle.  Good  Grief!  It  was  much  more
intimidating than I expected. With it being included in  every  local  guide
book as a primo ski destination somehow I naively thought  it  was  possible
to ski up it to the top. Not only could I not ski it I wasn\'t sure  I  could
get up it by any means. I suppose it being called a "pinnacle"  should  have
been a clue. I guess the guide books meant you skied  to  the  base  of  the
peak and not up it.

 I continued traversing below the pinnacle to the SW  notch  from  where  an
ascent at least looked feasible. But it was still intimidating and I  had  a
moment of doubt as to whether I really wanted to climb it. I left  my  skis,
donned boot crampons and with ice axe  in  hand  took  off  up  the  heavily
corniced ridge staying well away from the edge. I took my time testing  each
step and slowly worked my way up. It didn\'t help my confidence  that  I  had
neglected to bring a rope. It was also not helpful that as  I  climbed  past
ice covered rocks and trees chunks would break  off  and  slither  down  the
exposed slope below. Mindful of the huge  summit  cornice  (and  the  recent
accident on St Helens) I stayed well back of the edge  on  the  top.  I  was
most happy when I returned safely to my skis  at  11:45.  This  little  side
trip took 1.5 hrs of concentrated effort RT.

It was now on to my next objective to the NW, Pk 6527, but first  I  had  to
get off the ridge. Again  I  could  not  descend  directly  from  the  notch
because of cornices. I tried to contour the S side  but  rounding  a  corner
onto a SW aspect I hit a slope that was too steep and  icy  for  my  comfort
level even with ski crampons. From the summit of Coleman Pinnacle it  looked
as if the ridge crest could be followed W from the notch although the  first
part had steep fluted steps. So I booted up this section until I  could  ski
again.  Then I came to another notch that hadn\'t been visible from  Coleman.
Darn! I thought I was  trapped  with  nowhere  to  go.  However,  on  closer
careful examination, I found a break in the cornices and  a  reasonable  way
down onto the N slope where the snow was soft and powdery.

Inviting terrain led to the S ridge of Pk 6527 which I sought to follow  all
the way. Again I was thwarted, this time by a small  rocky  section  that  I
couldn\'t reasonably get past on skis. I was forced to descend some 200  feet
on the W slope and traverse below the ridge before climbing  back  up  to  a
notch past the problem area. The traverse was quite steep  but  by  now  the
snow here had softened in the sun. The last bit to the notch was  too  steep
for skis so I kicked steps up. From the notch it was  an  easy  ski  to  the
summit. I had lunch here at 2:00 and took in the 360 view.

Back at the notch it appeared I could descend directly to the E.  Again  the
first bit was too steep for  skis  but  once  below  that  I  had  the  best
downhill of the day, if not  the  season,  on  perfect  slopes  and  perfect
untracked powder snow. This more than made up for earlier hanging  onto  icy
slopes for dear life. The wonderful skiing continued on a traverse  all  the
way to Lasiocarpa Ridge, the summit of which I reached at 4:30.

I followed my tracks back to below Pk 6527. Then began a long  mostly  level
traverse on undulating terrain well below Coleman  Pinnacle  and  the  ridge
line. The snow remained good and I was able to proceed without  skinning  up
again. The traverse with all its ups and down and ins and  outs  was  longer
than it looked and darkness caught me still on the go.  On  the  way  I  was
treated to some of the most spectacular otherworldly sunset lighting  on  Mt
Shuksan I have ever had the privilege to  witness.  I  reached  the  welcome
sight of my tent at 7:00 (8.5 miles, 3300 ft, 11 hrs).

Saturday, February 20 - Not much needs to be said about this  day.  I  awoke
to the sun, took my time packing up and skied out as  a  leisurely  pace.  I
met two parties of weekend downhillers already coming in  (at  10:00)  as  I
climbed to the 5080 ft saddle below Table Mtn. Many more appeared at  Artist
Point and the ski area was an absolute zoo. It was a  challenge  for  me  to
ski down the last bit with my full  pack,  as  there  wasn\'t  a  slope  that
wasn\'t  tracked  and  rutted  by  now  and  skiers  and  snowboarders   were
everywhere. The parking lot was jammed, cars  parked  in  every  conceivable
spot. I was happy to be leaving the hordes behind.  But  I  just  smiled  to
myself in contentment.  I had already had my adventure (4 miles, 500  ft.  3
hrs).

Total: 18.5 miles and 5700 ft in 3 days

Hogback Mtn (6789 ft - P1989) and Hogback Ridge  (6652  ft  -  P132)  -  Old
Snowy Quad - March 3, 2010

The expansion of White Pass into Hogback Basin is taking place next  season,
so I wanted to get back into that area one  more  time  before  it  will  no
longer be the exclusive domain of backcountry  skiers.  There  were  several
inches of new snow  which  made  for  generally  good  conditions.  The  day
started sunny and warm but soon clouded up ending with  snow  showers,  some
of which were quite heavy.

After checking out the whimsical Snow Castle near the Day Lodge, I skied  up
the Main Street run to the base of Chair 4. Starting shortly  after  opening
downhill traffic was very light. From the chair base I skied  into  pleasant
untracked woods but soon ran into evidence of the expansion. The towers  for
two new lifts are already in place as are the cuts for  new  runs.  However,
once on Hogback Mtn (2400 ft, 2:45) I left  all  that  behind.  I  continued
along the gentle, but corniced ridge intending to go as far as  possible.  I
didn\'t count on a rocky pinnacle blocking the way. There  is  no  indication
of such an obstacle on the map. This forced me off the ridge into the  basin
to the E and onto a saddle above Shoe Lake. From here an easy  traverse  and
short climb led to Pt 6652 (2900 ft, 4 hrs) where I had a pleasant lunch  in
the sun.

Not wanting to quit yet I skied S and E off Pt 6652. Snow in  the  open  was
melting in the sun and getting heavy but once I hit the protected forest  it
was powder and the skiing very good. I kept going all  the  way  to  a  flat
meadow below Hidden Spring at 5400 ft where I decided it was  time  to  turn
around at 3:00. Of course now I had to  regain  the  1200  ft  back  to  the
saddle above Shoe Lake. At this point it began to  snow  rather  heavily.  I
removed skins again for a nice ski into the basin below the pinnacle  but  I
chose a low traverse back to Hogback Basin and  was  able  make  it  without
skinning up again. I skied the new runs and Main  Street  down  to  the  car
reaching it just at dark (6:30). Since the ski area was now closed I had  no
traffic to dodge. It snowed lightly all the way down.

The area north of White Pass is a generally flat plateau dotted with  dozens
of lakes and ponds that makes for wonderful ski touring but difficult  route
finding. Except for lakes and meadows it is all forested with  very  limited
views. This includes the few summits.  So  without  the  benefit  of  summer
trails it is hard to know where you are or how to get to where you  want  to
go. Unless you have an exceptional sense of direction  (which  I  don\'t),  a
map GPS is an absolute necessity to determine your location. Even with  such
a device, I did an awful lot of wandering around.  Every  time  I  tried  to
follow my instincts and the terrain to where I thought I should  go  I  went
astray, often by a large margin.  The main problem is you  cannot  follow  a
straight line from here to there. Each lake is  in  a  basin  surrounded  by
hills and small ravines and drainages. A lot  of  unseen  obstacles  can  be
hidden in 40 ft contours and what appears to  be  flat  on  the  map  really
isn\'t. Travel isn\'t all that difficult - it is just  not  direct  and  often
confusing.

Wednesday, March 10: Blankenship Lake - The only plowed  parking  spot  near
where  I  wanted  to  start  was  the  quarry  road  just  before  Dog  Lake
Campground. This put me on a steepish icy hillside above Dog  Lake  and  the
trail to Cramer Lake. I cast around for 30 minutes or so before  picking  up
an old snowshoe trench which led to the crossing of  North  Fork  Clear  Cr.
Fairly flat to here the trail then climbed steadily for about a  mile.  Snow
cover was thin and icy in this section and I remember  hoping  for  lots  of
new snow to make skiing out easier. Be careful what you wish for!

I lost all sign of the snowshoe trail in the next  gentle  mile  but  better
snow put me easily at Cramer Lake at 3:00 (1000 ft, 3  hrs).  From  here  my
planned route was to go directly to Hill Lake and I started off  in  what  I
thought was the "obvious" direction. I soon came to a  large  lake.  When  I
checked my GPS I was shocked to discover it was Dancing Lady Lk  and  I  was
off by 90 degrees. This is when it dawned on me that travel wasn\'t going  to
be as straight forward as I had thought and I would have to look at  my  GPS
more often. This I did, working my way over a shallow saddle to Hill Lk  and
then more or less contouring  in  and  out  of  numerous  drainages  on  the
hillside below Tumac Mtn. Eventually I  ended  up  at  Blankenship  Lake  (8
miles, 1700 ft, 6:40 hrs) where I set up camp in the dark. It had  begun  to
snow lightly and continued to do so all night long.

Thursday, March 11: Pk 5934 and Fryingpan Mtn - It was  23  degrees  in  the
morning and still  snowing,  which  made  for  great  skiing  conditions.  I
started at 8:00 heading for the saddle leading to Twin Sisters Lakes.  Again
I was forced by the terrain and an errant sense of direction to  wander  and
it took over an hour to get there. Then once there I got confused. This  was
no ordinary saddle with an obvious up on one side and  an  obvious  down  on
the other but a broad undulating flat with little ups and downs all over.  I
would also have difficulty on the return.

Once across the saddle lovely meadows led down to Twin Sisters  Lakes.  Here
I found numerous Otter slide tracks (I had seen my first one the day  before
at Dancing Lady Lk). These tracks are very distinctive  -  about  10  inches
wide, smooth troughs on hills  and  interspersed  with  paw  prints  on  the
flats. I read that these fun loving  creatures  prefer  to  slide  on  their
bellies to travel on snow even on level ground or slightly  uphill.  Judging
by the numerous slides I encountered, I would say the  Otter  population  is
healthy in this area.

In heavy snowfall I skied across both  Twin  Sisters  Lakes  to  a  steepish
gully at the far end leading to the gentle summit ridge  of  Pk  5934  (1200
ft, 4:30 hrs). This summit completed the Cougar Lake Quad for me.  I  had  a
nice run down to another confusing flat saddle below  Fryingpan  Mtn  before
finding the E Ridge. The first part of this ridge, which  I  turned  on  the
right, was quite steep, but it gentled near the summit (2200 ft, 8:30  hrs).
More nice skiing off Fryingpan was followed by more wandering to get  around
Pk 5934 and back to Big Twin Sister Lake. I crossed the  lake  by  headlight
in darkness and heavy snow. All I could see were my ski tips which was  very
disorienting. I couldn\'t ski a straight line and had to  constantly  correct
course by GPS.

It had been snowing steadily all day - my guess is at least 10 inches.  This
meant my previous tracks were gone and I had to break trail all over  again.
And since I couldn\'t even see my tracks I had to routefind  all  over  again
also. That meant using my GPS constantly and wearing down the  batteries.  I
did have a second set but I was already using them. Normally I don\'t use  my
GPS on the return as I can either see where I am  going  or  can  follow  my
tracks and two sets of batteries are more than  sufficient.  I  was  getting
nervous about being so dependent on an electronic  device  and  I  began  to
ration battery life by turning the GPS off after every location fix.

I got confused once again on the broad Twin Sisters-Blankenship  saddle,  so
much so that I started heading for Round  Lk,  almost  180  degrees  in  the
wrong direction. I was forced to use my GPS more than I would have liked.  I
reached my tent, which looked much like an igloo by now and had  to  be  dug
out, at 10:30 (15 miles, 3200 ft, 14:30 hrs).

Friday, March 12: Blankenship Mtn - It was 35 degrees and the inside  of  my
tent was all wet in the morning. This is what can  make  backcountry  skiing
in the  Pacific  Northwest  so  frustrating,  the  widely  fluctuating  snow
levels. At least it was snowing lightly and not raining. I  started  for  Pk
5760+ (which I have named  Blankenship  Mtn)  at  7:40.  Despite  a  nagging
feeling of impending doom, I didn\'t  want  to  leave  without  tagging  this
summit. It was just too close and I had worked too hard  to  get  here.  The
snow was still reasonable to start though  beginning  to  turn  into  mashed
potatoes,  Blankenship  Meadows  were  lovely,  the  summit  pleasant,   the
downhill fun, and I got to follow my tracks back (4 miles, 900 ft, 3.5  hrs
RT). All in all worth the time risk taken.

I packed up wet gear and headed out at 11:30. It took me longer to  get  out
than it had to get in. Trail breaking was more work, I was  more  tired  and
despite trying to improve on my in route, I didn\'t. Every more  direct  line
I tried gained me nothing and even lost time. Meanwhile  I  could  feel  the
temperature dropping as the snow level was on its  way  down  again.  I  was
able to ski down the steepish trail section to the creek  crossing,  despite
an icy crust just starting to form. There was enough new  snow  to  slow  me
down.

I completely lost the trail about Â½ mile before Dog Lake  in  the  darkness.
You would think a person couldn\'t possibly have problems here,  but  I  sure
managed to. Between the now very icy densely wooded  hillside  on  my  right
and the obstacle ridden marsh on my left and with no trail to  guide  me,  I
made very slow progress. And then my GPS completely died. There was  no  way
I could find a direct way through the woods to my car without it. I  had  to
fall back on the low tech but sure method of hitting a base line -  Hwy  12.
You can\'t imagine how happy I was to finally see  the  lights  of  vehicles.
With my tail between my legs and my ego shattered, I limped along  the  edge
of the road back to my car. I am sure I turned a few heads  in  the  passing
cars. One even stopped to offer a ride but by that time I  was  so  close  I
declined. Besides I just didn\'t  want  to  deal  with  an  explanation  (8.5
miles, 400 ft, 8:30 hrs).

My car was encased in about 5 inches of melted and refrozen crust.  It  took
30 minutes to chip the windows free. It snowed all the way down to  Packwood
where it finally turned to rain.

Total: 35.5 miles and 6200 ft in 3 days

Heliotrope Ridge (7242 ft - P82 - Mt Baker Quad) - March 17-18, 2010

Wednesday, March 17 - With 10 inches of new snow reported over night  at  Mt
Baker, I headed north. The new snow promised good skiing  but  made  getting
high on Glacier Cr Road a bit tricky. Fresh snow started about 2000  ft  and
rapidly increased to where I was forced to stop at 3100 ft about I mile  shy
of the current SnoPark at 3560 ft. Several other vehicles were  parked  here
including one hauling snow mobiles.

I skied the road past  the  SnoPark  to  the  Heliotrope  Ridge  TH  at  the
switchback (elev 3700 ft).  The new snow made the trail just  skiable  going
up at the start but I knew I would be walking down part of it as many  rocks
and roots in the dense woods were barely covered.  A party had already  been
up (and down) the trail and I had no trail breaking as  the  forest  thinned
and the snow depth increased higher. I found a  scenic  spot  to  camp  just
above the tree line at 5200 ft (3.5 miles, 2200 ft, 3 hrs). Despite  a  very
late start I had plenty of time to set up  camp,  relax  and  even  take  an
evening tour before turning in at 8:30.

Thursday, March 18 - I was on my way before  8:00  on  a  clear  but  frigid
morning, temps in the low twenties. I worked my way up easy terrain  to  the
crest of Heliotrope Ridge (hitting welcome sun just  below)  and  along  the
ridge to the high point (2200 ft, 2  hrs).  The  view  of  Lincoln  directly
across the Thunder Glacier was stunning, as  were  The  Sisters  beyond  the
Middle Fork Nooksack River. From my high point I skied W along the ridge  to
a  slightly  lower  but  very  attractive  knoll  with  inviting  completely
untracked slopes. Once on that I skied down the friendliest of  terrain  for
a delightful run back to camp (4 miles, 2450  ft,  4  hrs  RT).  I  met  two
parties coming up as I skied down. I took a short nap in a tent  sun  warmed
to a pleasant 60 degrees before heading out (2 hrs  to  car).   Surely  this
has to be one of my most leisurely pleasant trips in a while. A nice  change
of pace.

Total: 11 miles and 4650 ft in two half days

On my trip to Coleman Pinnacle a month ago I was struck by  all  the  lovely
ski terrain on The Portals and the Sholes Glacier. Unfortunately I  ran  out
of time  to  include  them  then.  I  could  barely  wait  to  rectify  that
situation. All I needed was the right conditions again although neither  the
snow nor the weather was as perfect as I had hoped.

Tuesday, March 23 - The ski area had some 9 inches  total  fresh  snow  from
Sunday and Monday, all of which was rapidly turning to slush when I  arrived
at noon. Despite overcast skies, it was downright balmy. I worried that  wet
avalanches could be a problem. It turned  out  they  weren\'t.  I  skied  the
usual approach to Artist Point and under the cliffs  of  Table  Mtn  to  the
saddle with Ptarmigan Ridge.  There  were  no  fresh  tracks  of  any  other
backcountry skiers having gone this way. From the saddle  I  stayed  on  the
right side of Ptarmigan Ridge traversing between  5000  and  5200  ft  until
past Coleman Pinnacle. I had skied this traverse on my previous trip but  it
had been dark so it was like it was all new terrain. Once past the  pinnacle
I climbed up a N facing bowl where the snow was preserved powder to  a  6120
ft saddle. Here I set up camp by some rocks as  a  partial  protection  from
the growing wind (6 miles, 2700 ft. 5 hrs). It was a very scenic  spot.  The
wind increased during the night which did not bode well for  my  summit  day
but it did keep my tent condensation free.

Wednesday, March 24 - It barely got below freezing during the night and  the
day dawned hazy but that didn\'t  prevent  S  slopes  from  turning  to  hard
crust. From camp I made a descending traverse to the broad  6000  ft  saddle
below E Portal. One  short  stretch  was  so  crusty  I  carried  skies  and
cramponed down. But from then on I could ski and the snow was quite good.  I
easily reached the summit of E Portal at 9:30 (600 ft,  1:15  hr).   What  a
view point! It was windy but not horribly so.

I could not descend directly to Portal Saddle because of obvious  cliffs  so
I backtracked to a trough that appeared to go smoothly down  to  the  Sholes
Glacier. It did not. The first part was a fantastic  ski  but  it  ended  in
unseen cliffs. I was able to bypass them on the left on very steep snow  but
I had to boot down to do so. Once  on  the  Sholes  Glacier  it  was  heaven
skiing to Portal Saddle.  Continuous  snow  led  directly  from  here  to  W
Portal, however it looked awfully steep so I elected for an end  run  around
on friendlier terrain. The higher I got on W Portal the windier it  got.  On
the wide open summit plateau it was downright  brutal  and  I  could  barely
stay upright. My guess is a steady 40-50 mph with a few higher gusts. I  had
to sit down to take my summit photos to avoid  being  blown  off.  I  didn\'t
stay long on top (1700 ft, 3:15). I found a semi sheltered spot  in  a  wind
carved hole to remove my skins. I quickly skied out of  the  ferocious  wind
zone and had a great run down the Sholes Glacier  past  all  the  cliffs  to
where I could climb back to the 6000 ft saddle and then to  camp  (6  miles,
2300 ft, 5 hrs RT).

It was only slightly after 1:00. I had been prepared  to  stay  another  day
and ski to other destinations  but  the  brutal  wind  made  higher  terrain
unappealing. And the forecast  for  Thursday  was  rain.  So  I  decided  to
consider the trip a success and retreat. I left at 2:20.  By  now  all  snow
was melting but it was not bad skiing. By the time I reached  the  ski  area
runs they were closed so I didn\'t have  to  content  with  the  downhillers.
Snow in the shade was just beginning to crust over, but not enough to  cause
any difficulties. Good timing. I reached my car at 5:40 (6  miles,  500  ft,
3:20 hrs).

Total: 18 miles and 5500 ft in 2 days

Carlton Ridge (5680+ ft - P520 - White Pass Quad) - March 30-April 1, 2010

I didn\'t think there would be enough lowland snow to ski the  trail  to  Jug
Lake this year, but all that changed with the recent new  dump.  Also,  this
is a perfect area to go to when the avalanche danger is high as the  terrain
is mostly gentle or heavily wooded.

Tuesday, March 30 - Over a foot of new snow stopped me on FR 4510 1.4  miles
past Summit Cr campground at 3000 ft. This left 1.6 miles of  flat  road  to
ski to the TH at Soda Springs, elev 3200 ft. It was snowing heavily  when  I
arrived but the sun came out by the time I got started. Such was  the  order
of the day - showers and sun breaks. The snow was very  wet  and  heavy  and
trail breaking an effort so progress was slow.  Snow cover was  adequate  to
ski the trail. The main problem was the numerous creek  crossings,  although
I only had to remove skis to get across one. I even managed to keep skis  on
at Jug Cr by bridging snow-covered rocks. Shortly after that  I  came  to  a
trail junction sign and headed uphill to Jug  Lake  arriving  at  7:30  with
just enough time to set up camp in fading light  (5  miles,  1550  ft,  5:45
hrs). The temperature was above freezing but dropping fast.

Wednesday, March 31 -  There  was  light  snow  during  the  night  and  the
temperature in the morning was 18 degrees.  Again  showers  and  sun  breaks
occurred all day. I skied around Jug Lake and then  meadows  toward  Carlton
Ridge. The meadows were lovely but had unexpected obstacles in  the  way  of
numerous melted out meandering creek  channels  that  were  hard  to  detect
until almost right upon them.  This  necessitated  frequent  small  detours.
Then the upper reaches of Jug Cr were not as friendly as  I  had  hoped  but
turned out to be steep dense woods above the stream cut. I would  have  done
better to head straight to Carlton Ridge lower down but I really  wanted  to
go to Kincaid Lake, which was totally worth the effort.  From  the  lake  it
was easy access to the ridge high point (1300  ft,  3:40  hrs).  I  hit  the
summit during a sun break and had a pleasant lunch in its warmth.

My main goal of reaching the summit of Carlton Ridge met, I  took  the  rest
of the day to wander wherever my skis led me. And wander I  did.  Slopes  in
the sun were melting and turning slushy so  I  skied  off  the  NW  side  in
delicious powder. I followed the W side of the  ridge  through  two  saddles
and on to Pt 5660, a definite top. I had a nice ski off  that  on  E  slopes
that were wooded enough to still  be  powdery.  I  meandered  the  Jug  Lake
meadows again until I could climb over the low saddle to Upper  Chain  Lake.
I returned to camp along the S shore of Jug Lake.  Open  water  was  showing
here so I didn\'t dare ski across the lake. I had some worry  about  crossing
the outlet creek. To my amazement there was a skiable snow bridge,  although
it was a bit spooky to cross. I reached my tent at 6:00 (7 miles,  2200  ft,
9:45 hrs). It was 36 degrees.

Thursday, April 1 - It had  snowed  about  an  inch  overnight  and  was  25
degrees in the morning. Everything that had melted the day  before  was  now
crusty. But in the woods much of the  snow  was  still  powder.  Skiing  was
really quite good and trail breaking much easier. I really wanted to ski  to
Fryingpan Lake. It was much harder than anticipated to make my way  up  what
appeared on the map to be a short easy slope to the lake. Again steep  dense
woods and the deep gully of upper Summit Creek were  impediments.  But  once
up that the terrain gentled and opened up as I made my way past Little  Snow
Lake to Fryingpan  Lake.  I  was  having  so  much  fun  I  couldn\'t  resist
extending my excursion and climbing Fryingpan  Mtn  again  (I  had  done  it
about 2 weeks ago) just for the downhill run. Despite what looked like  very
steep terrain on  the  map  the  woods  were  open  enough  and  the  powder
preserved and deep enough that I could ski  it  in  style.  And  the  summit
ridge was a delight. Sometimes you just can\'t  tell  from  a  map  what  the
terrain will be like. I returned to camp at 12:20 (4.5  miles,  1500  ft,  4
hrs RT). Again it was 36 degrees.

I left at 1:10. I was able to ski all the way out although  there  had  been
much melting on the lower trail and cover was getting thin in spots. When  I
reached the car at 4:40 it was snowing heavily (5 miles, 150 ft, 3:30 hrs).

Total: 21.5 miles and 5400 ft in 3 days

When I left on Tuesday the forecast was good for all of Wednesday. This  was
to be followed by snow levels rising briefly to 5000 ft and quickly  falling
to 1500 ft in advance of a strong  front  coming  in  Thursday.   Well,  the
front must have intensified and  come  in  early  as  I  got  caught  midday
Wednesday in a late posted winter storm warning. An  avalanche  warning  was
also posted for Thursday. Timing can be everything in winter trips and  mine
was about 24 hours off on this one.

Tuesday, April 6 - I drove over White Pass and up Indian Cr Road 1308  about
1.4 mile before being stopped by snow (elev 3150 ft), which left  1.5  miles
to ski to the TH. The new snow varied from 6-12 inches and was very wet  and
heavy to start. Trail breaking was  a  real  chore.  The  trail  was  easily
followed to the first crossing of Indian Cr, although one side  gully  where
it was washed out took some time. With no bridge, crossing  Indian  Cr  took
even more time. Steep switchbacks on the other side climbed out of the  deep
ravine onto a bench above. I lost the trail leading to the  second  crossing
but found a way across on a snow bridge and picked up  the  trail  again  on
the other side. By the time I reached the  third  crossing  it  was  getting
late and despite my goal to reach Indian Cr Meadows I decided to  stop  here
in a small meadow, elev 4840 ft.  Although the weather had been pretty  good
most of the day, it began to snow lightly as I set  up  my  tent  (6  miles,
2000 ft, 6:30 hrs).

Wednesday, April 7 - It was 27 degrees in the  morning  and  had  snowed  an
inch or so overnight. I recrossed Indian Cr and worked my way to  the  broad
saddle between Arnesons and McNeil Pks. The snow was much  drier  here,  the
woods open, the skiing quite good and  I  was  thoroughly  enjoying  myself.
From the saddle, I climbed onto McNeil\'s NW ridge, the upper part  of  which
was quite lovely, and then onto the SW ridge.  Here I  encountered  some  of
the most heavily rimed trees I have ever seen. There  must  have  been  some
extremely wild weather here recently. Fortunately, the weather was good  for
me up to this point, with even a few sun breaks and a  partial  view  toward
White Pass. I was optimistic it would stay that way. It  didn\'t.   I  booted
the last few feet to the summit (2200 ft, 4 hrs).

Skiing was good off McNeil back to the saddle. I had hoped to get a view  of
Arnesons Pk, the upper part of which is bare, but only got glimpses  through
the trees and thickening clouds. I wandered a bit through the  forest  until
breaking out onto open slopes. It was now beginning to snow and by the  time
I reached the summit of Arnesons (3400 ft,  7:15  hr)  it  was  blowing  and
snowing heavily and downright nasty. I could barely see  to  ski  down.  All
thought of extending my tour to Indian Cr  Meadows  was  abandoned.  By  the
time I reached my camp (7 miles, 3400 ft, 8:40 hr RT), it  was  questionable
whether what was coming down was snow or rain.  As  I  took  shelter  in  my
bombproof tent from the growing  storm  it  soon  became  just  plain  rain.
During  the  night  this  changed  to  heavy  snow  with  gusty  winds.  The
temperature was 36 degrees to start before falling rapidly to 26.

Thursday, April 8 - Packing up in the morning was not  fun.  It  had  snowed
about 8 inches and was still snowing hard. After being rained on and  snowed
on and freezing my tent was an icy disaster. When  I  unpacked  it  at  home
later there were still ice chunks clinging to it. And the poles were  frozen
and stuck. I had to breathe on them  to  get  them  apart.  My  tracks  were
almost completely covered and I had to  break  trail  all  over  again.   It
seemed as much work going out as coming in. I reached the  car  at  1:20  (6
miles, 250 ft, 5:20 hrs). Fortunately there was only a few inches  new  snow
here so I had no trouble driving out to Hwy 12, but I ran into  bad  weather
with blowing snow all the way to Morton. Beyond there  it  was  inexplicably
blue skies and sunny. Strange weather indeed.

Total: 19 miles and 5650 ft in 3 days

When I left for Albuquerque over a week ago for a family visit I  thought  I
was done with ski touring for this  season  but  I  returned  to  continuing
winter weather with fresh snow. So I had to retrieve my  skis  from  storage
once again.

 I drove FR 48 from Hwy 12 near Packwood 7.3 miles before being  stopped  by
a snow patch at 3300 ft. It took another Â½ mile of  on  and  off  skiing  to
reach continuous snow on the road. It was snowing when I  started  and  snow
showers, some quite heavy, continued off and on all day. It probably  snowed
2-3 inches total while I was out. I skied mostly  on  roads  only  going  XC
briefly to reach both summits. The two summit ridges  were  open  enough  to
provide good skiing. I also took a side trip up the 4320+ ft Pt  W  of  Hall
Ridge just to extend the day,  but  I  had  to  boot  up  that  one  due  to
inadequate snow cover and thick trees.

Total: 13 miles, 2200 ft and 7 hrs.

keeps on coming. What to do? I needed a safe destination to ski and  decided
on this trip. I have had it in mind for a while but in a strange  twist  was
not able to do it this winter as there was  never  enough  lowland  snow  to
ski. The conditions were perfect today and it ended up being a  surprisingly
enjoyable tour.

I drove 20.7 miles from Darrington on FRs 2810, 2811 and 28.  It  took  over
an hour to drive this distance due  to  many  potholes  and  much  new  snow
starting at about 2000 ft. I pushed it as far as I  could  in  my  jeep  but
finally came to a dead stop at 3200 ft. No other vehicles had  been  up  the
road or came later. Snow was over a foot deep, wet and  heavy,  and  it  was
snowing when I started but the weather improved as the day went on.

Lucky Logger - I took a spur road right to a clear-cut on  the  SW  side.  I
was afraid I would have to crash tight trees but once out of  the  clear-cut
the woods were open and  pleasant  for  skiing.  No  views  on  this  wooded
summit. I skied more open woods NW to intersect the main road (28) again.

Ole Mtn - This peak has two summits  of  equal  contours.  I  couldn\'t  tell
which was higher. Both have been clear-cut with a spur road to the  top  and
nice views. The ridge to Ole 2 was especially delightful.

Slash Mtn - This peak deserves a better name than this derogatory one as  it
is really very attractive, as least in winter, with a somewhat  alpine  feel
and corniced ridges. It was the best of the three. Another spur road led  to
the saddle with Segelsen Ridge. From here I followed a continuation  of  the
road along the SW slope until I could access the W ridge. I had to  boot  up
the final 40 feet to the top.

I returned to the car in 1:45 hours  despite  several  miles  of  very  flat
road. The fact that snow that was in the sun was beginning to  ice  over  by
this time helped speed things up.

Total: 14 miles, 3800 ft and 8.5 hrs

Ulalach Pk (5040+  ft  -  P440)  and  Higher  Squire  (4879  ft  -  P799)  -
Whitehorse Quad - May 7-8, 2010

Friday, May 7: Ulalach Pk - I started from the Eightmile TH (elev  1700  ft)
off the Clear Cr Rd 2060 and Rd 2065. This  TH  is  much  used  by  climbers
heading for Three O\'Clock Rock and the trail is fairly good to  that  point.
Beyond that it gets quite rough, steep, rocky, rooty and  wet.  I  ran  into
snow starting at 3000 ft and put on snowshoes at 3800 ft although  I  should
have put them on sooner. I used them to 3500 ft on the way out. No  one  had
been this way since the last heavy snowfall. Weather was partly  sunny  both
days with the afternoons cloudy and  threatening  showers.  Farther  to  the
east looked positively stormy. I set up camp at Squire Cr  Pass  (elev  4100
ft) with a lovely view of Three Fingers and Whitehorse (3  miles,  2500  ft,
3:20 hrs).

I started for Ulalach in late afternoon. The  distant  view  of  this  rocky
peak showed the  easiest  route  would  be  up  the  snow-covered  SW  face.
However, it looked steep and was in full sun and I wasn\'t sure it  would  be
safe. I would just have to go and see. I traversed through woods to  the  SW
ridge and followed this ridge to where I could drop off  it  onto  the  open
face. I was a little worried about crossing below  slabs  to  get  to  safer
terrain on a wooded rib on the far left. It might have  also  been  possible
to stay on the ridge all the way to the top but it  looked  to  be  possibly
class 4 and challenging with the partial snow cover. As it  turned  out  the
SW face was no problem and showed no  signs  of  instability  and  the  snow
consolidated enough that I soon ditched the  snowshoes.  But  just  to  make
sure I stayed on the wooded rib all  the  way  to  the  NW  ridge.  Cornices
prevented me from direct access to the summit. I had to drop off the E  side
and traverse below the ridge until right below the summit. This side was  in
the shade and step kicking good. On the return,  following  my  tracks,  one
small slide came off the summit slabs still exposed to the sun  but  it  was
far from me and it stopped as soon as it hit the snow slope (3  miles,  1500
ft, 4 hrs RT from camp).

Saturday, May 8: Higher Squire -  It  was  cold  enough  overnight  for  the
surface of the snow to form a crust so I didn\'t need snowshoes as I  started
for Higher Squire at 8:45.  As I climbed I heard several  slides  come  down
the E face of Three Fingers, which was in full morning sun.  I  reached  the
summit easily from the W saddle and ridge (850 ft,:50 hr). I then turned  my
attention to seeing if I could  find  a  way  up  Squire  Spire.  It  is  an
impressive looking little spire that looked to be  quite  challenging  under
the present snowy conditions. I first tried  from  the  saddle  with  Higher
Squire. I couldn\'t even get past the first bump. A traverse below  the  bump
on the S slope on thinly covered slabs or  a  direct  route  over  the  bump
along the ridge were both above my comfort level. I next tried  from  the  W
ridge. Trying for the first notch to the W I couldn\'t get across  the  moat.
I tried again farther W and made the ridge but again a  traverse  on  the  S
slope was too steep and exposed. I would have to return  at  a  later  date.
It did look to be a fun rock scramble when the snow is gone. I was  not  too
unhappy as that would give me an excuse to return to this lovely area.

I returned to camp at 11:00 (1.5 miles, 1100 ft, 2:15 hrs RT)  and  left  an
hour later. I reached Three O\'Clock Rock, which was swarming  with  climbers
on this Saturday, just as a rain  shower  hit.  I  heard  much  yelling  and
commotion from climbers quickly retreating as I passed.  The  shower  lasted
the rest of the way to the car (3 miles, 1:50 hrs).

Total: 10.5 miles and 5100 ft in a leisurely 2 days

The weather was lovely.  The  snow  conditions  were  not.  Both  days  were
unseasonably warm, SCARY WARM, with  deep  slushy  unstable  snow  and  high
avalanche danger. Because of this I chose these two  "relatively  safe"  day
climbs with a car camp at the Hannegan Pass TH  overnight.  Even  so  I  had
several moments of concern.

Friday, May 14: Slate Mtn - What I thought  would  be  a  short  easy  climb
turned into a bit more due to the snow  conditions.  Beginning  at  noon,  I
dropped north 300 ft from the Baker Ski Area parking lot on the  E  side  of
Bagley Cr until I could cross to the  W  and  start  an  ascending  traverse
below the cliffs of Herman Pk. It was slow  going  in  the  soft  snow  with
evidence  of  recent  avalanches  everywhere  but  nothing  current,   thank
heavens. I eventually rounded Herman to enter an open  basin  from  where  I
could work my way up the SE slope of Slate. There was much avalanche  debris
here with again no current activity  but  the  soft  snow  did  not  inspire
confidence as the slope steepened to 45-50 degrees. I stuck to the trees  as
much as possible using them as anchors and handholds but I was not happy  or
comfortable with the situation. When I pulled onto the summit at 4:00  (2500
ft) I had already decided I wasn\'t going down  that  way.   I  followed  the
gentle ridge SW until it turned rocky and I scrambled to a steep step  above
the col with Mt Herman. I was not expecting anything technical on this  peak
but I did have my 100 ft panic rope with me and two 50 ft rappels put me  on
easy snow. This was a  much  better  way  off  Slate  than  down  the  steep
unstable SE slope. The snow was even softer and more exhausting on the  rest
of the way back to the car but there were no other difficulties.

Total: 3.5 miles, 2800 ft and 7 hrs

Saturday, May 15: Goat Hunter and Mamie Pk - Again what I thought  would  be
reasonably easy and  straightforward  was  not  and  I  encountered  several
problems. From a car camp at the Hannegan Pass TH I headed into  the  brush,
seeking a direct route to Mamie Pass, and encountered problem #1. Unable  to
see where I was going I think I chose the worst possible line. I kept  going
left trying to get to big trees. I should have gone right.  I  ended  up  in
horrible brush  and  then  encountered  an  impassible  cliff  band  with  a
waterfall. It was so bad I very nearly gave up. After  much  verbal  ranting
and cursing I eventually worked my way up right along the base of the  cliff
to a wooded rib and salvation. It took me 2 hours to go this initial 800  ft
gain. But hey, I got to see a waterfall very few, if any, people  have  ever
seen.

Once on the wooded rib things went much better. Breaking out of the trees  I
hit a nice dirt gully and then continuous snow  and  problem  #2,  extremely
soft snow, even softer than on Slate,  and  enervating  trail  breaking.  It
seemed to take forever to reach the ridge at 5700 ft (2700 ft 4:30 hrs).  On
the ridge again things looked up. Views were fantastic and goat tracks  were
everywhere although I never saw one of the  critters.  I  went  over  a  few
bumps until I thought what I was looking at was the summit. It looked  quite
easy and I thought I had it made. Then I came to  a  notch  where  a  higher
pointed summit appeared in the near distance. What  was  this?  It  must  be
Goat Mtn. No it is too close for Goat. My  heart  sank  as  I  came  to  the
realization that this was my peak, Goat Hunter.

Now to problem #3. As I got a closer look I knew I couldn\'t climb this  peak
safely along the ridge. The snow was too steep and too unstable and the  top
was guarded by a vertical cornice. The only other possible  safe  route  was
from the SW side which would involve a drop of 600 ft to get  past  all  the
cliffs. This is when it dawned on me it was going to be  a  very  long  day.
This little detour would add two extra hours. I tried not to think about  it
too much as I dropped down easy slopes to the SW slope  and  plodded  slowly
back up again to the summit. I just went on  auto  pilot  while  time  stood
still. I reached the top at 2:30 (4100 ft, 7 hrs). Then I  reversed  it  all
over again - down 800 ft and up 600 ft back to  the  false  summit,  all  in
deep wet slushy snow.

I still wanted to climb Mamie Pk but  wasn\'t  sure  I  had  enough  time  or
energy left. I guess I got a second wind because I  quickly  made  it  Mamie
Pass (a lovely spot by the way) and charged up the remaining 900  ft.  Which
brings me to problem(s) #4  -  a  series  of  totally  unexpected  technical
difficulties not obvious from the distant view on Mamie. First was  crossing
a short (4 ft) vertical cornice and crack getting from the N onto  the  main
W summit ridge. It wasn\'t really that difficult. It was just that  the  snow
couldn\'t be trusted for secure steps and a slip here would  mean  a  serious
slide over cliffs. The same for a crack forming between snow and  rock  just
above the cornice.  I surmounted both by  excavating  and  harvesting  loose
surface snow to fill cracks and packing it to create  solid  steps.  Then  I
encountered two class 4 rock steps that  could  not  be  bypassed  on  snow,
again due to unstable cornices. All this took time but finally  I  stood  on
the summit of Mamie at 6:00 (5700 ft, 10:40 hrs).

I rappelled the top rock step, downclimbed the next rock step and  rappelled
the suspect snow above the cornice step since there was a handy  tree.  Then
it was fast down to Mamie Pass and on down to intersect  my  uphill  tracks.
Once on the wooded rib below the snow I stayed on it  all  the  way  to  the
valley floor bypassing all the horrible brush and cliffs I  had  encountered
on the way up and came out just slightly uphill of  my  car  at  8:20.  Good
thing I got an early start and the days are long.

Total: 4.5 miles, 5700 ft and 13 hrs

Battle Mtn (7710 ft - P430), Snowshoe Ridge (7816 ft -  P736)  and  Duckbill
Mtn (6536 ft - P616) - Oval Pk Quad - May 29-31, 2010

I think I changed my plans 3 times  before  finally  settling  at  the  last
minute on the Chelan - Sawtooth area as giving the  best  chances  for  good
weather and safe travel. Miraculously I never had to use my  rain  parka.  I
even had a fair amount of sun.

Saturday, May 29: Duckbill Mtn - I ran into heavy rain over Snoqualmie  Pass
but by the time I got to the Eagle Cr TH (elev 3000 ft) up the Twisp  River,
all precipitation had ceased. I started up the trail at  1:30.  It  had  the
usual amount of downed trees for this time of year before  logging  out  has
taken place. At 1.5 miles the trail crosses Eagle Cr. I knew I might have  a
problem right from the TH as I could hear the water  roaring  from  all  the
recent rain and snow melt. Sure enough I could see  no  way  across  without
wading. To do this safely I would have to keep my  boots  on  and  I  didn\'t
want to start the trip with wet  ones.  What  to  do?  The  trail  has  been
rerouted recently to cross the creek to the  south,  continue  on  the  Oval
Lakes trail to a junction, parallel the creek on the  south  side  and  then
cross again to the north. The old trail stayed on the north side  and  never
crossed the creek. So I decided to try and follow the old  trail  and  avoid
the creek crossings altogether.

I found the old trail right at the  Wilderness  boundary  sign.  It  was  in
pretty good shape too, at least to start. Then I discovered why it had  been
abandoned and rerouted. A large section of trail on  a  steep  hillside  had
slid into Eagle Creek. I forced a way around  this  by  dropping  below  and
climbing very steeply back up to the trail. The next section  of  trail  was
fairly overgrown and brushy and I was most  happy  when  I  intersected  the
main trail again. This little escapade had cost maybe an hour but  at  least
I still had dry feet.

I started running into snow at about 4500  ft  and  was  forced  to  put  on
snowshoes about 5000 ft. The snow was unreliable crust in the woods and  wet
slush in any open area. It was  slow  going  with  no  views  to  break  the
monotony. At 6:30 I found a bare ground campsite under trees at the edge  of
a small meadow near Silver Lake, elev 5800 ft (5 miles, 2900 ft, 5  hrs).  I
even had a view of Oval Pk out my front door.

I started for Duckbill at 7:30 fully  expecting  to  get  back  after  dark.
First up I had to get across Eagle Creek. Admittedly it was much  tamer  and
smaller here but still not trivial. Fortunately I found a small  log  fairly
close by - fun crossing with snowshoes on. Then everything went much  better
than anticipated. It was easy snowshoeing through open forest  to  the  base
of the steepening S ridge. Here I  left  the  snowshoes  as  the  ridge  was
mostly melted out and bare. In fact Duckbill is  a  delightful  little  peak
with a wonderful view which I hit at  sunset  lighting.  I  only  needed  my
headlight for the log crossing returning to camp at 9:30 (2 miles,  900  ft,
2 hrs RT).

Sunday, May 30:  Snowshoe  Ridge  and  Battle  Mtn  -  Starting  at  8:00  I
continued on the trail until past the main cliffy S slope of Snowshoe  where
I could see a reasonable route up. Since it started quite steep  and  mostly
snow free, I left my snowshoes here. That was probably a mistake  as  I  ran
into more gentle terrain and deeper snow higher up but it was  not  a  major
problem. Snowshoe is a pleasant ridge with even better  views  (2000  ft,  3
hrs). Massive Oval Peak dominated the landscape and it continued  to  do  so
all day. The summit rocks were bare and I left a register in the  cairn  (as
I did on all 3 peaks).

I returned to my snowshoes and put them back on for  Battle.  The  snow  was
getting very soft by now and the last quite steep climb  to  the  summit  up
the E Ridge was exhausting. At the top I had to chop my way through a  small
cornice to gain the broad summit (3100 ft, 6 hrs). It was now only 2:30  and
too early to return to camp so I decided to climb Pt 6960+ ft.  Although  it
doesn\'t have the requisite prominence, this is  an  attractive  point  above
Eagle Pass.

Filtered sun and warm temperatures were causing numerous  small  spontaneous
slides off the steep E slopes of Battle Mtn and ridge  connecting  to  Eagle
Pass.  I dropped to 7000 ft and traversed below the activity. On the  way  I
came across a fascinating phenomenon I had never seen  before.  It  appeared
to be a type of "avalanche" where the top layer of snow "wrinkles"  down  as
a continuous unit much like a large carpet being pushed downhill.

From spacious Eagle Pass I tried to get up Pt 7960+ but gave  up  about  100
ft from the top. I hit a rock band and the snow was too steep  and  unstable
to traverse around it. But I had accomplished my goal of extending the  day.
I turned around at 5:00. Back at Eagle Pass I came across fresh tracks of  a
bear that weren\'t there on the way up. Mr. Bear needed snowshoes as  he  was
sinking in about a foot with each step. I looked around carefully but  never
saw the creature. The tracks  went  one  way  and  I  another  as  I  headed
directly back to camp. Lower down where I intersected my uphill track  below
Snowshoe Ridge I ran across the  bear  prints  again,  presumably  the  same
animal. He was using my tracks. Smart animal. The tracks continued  to  very
near camp and I feared maybe my dinner was gone. I had  hung  my  food  but,
thinking mostly of rodents, only 5 feet off the ground.  Not  to  worry,  my
food was untouched (8 miles, 4200 ft, 11 hrs).

Monday, May 31 - It rained lightly most of the night but considerately  quit
by the time I was ready to leave in the morning at 8:30. The sun  even  came
out. I was undecided about whether to  return  on  the  old  or  new  trail.
Finding a nice log at the upper crossing of Eagle Creek  swayed  me  to  the
new trail. Two wadings would have been too much. I had hoped that the  water
level would be less than on Saturday at the  lower  crossing.  It  was  not.
Even with my boots on for good footing and only knee deep, the crossing  was
dicey. The water was very forceful. Too  lazy  to  take  off  my  boots  and
change socks, I squished the remaining 1.5 miles back to the car  (5  miles,
3:30 hrs).

Total: 20 miles and 8000 ft in 3 days

Lookout Mtn (5515 ft - P1435 - Twisp West Quad) - Not  wanting  to  hit  the
peak of the Memorial Day backup over Snoqualmie Pass, I chose to  kill  some
time on the delightful trail up  this  peak  just  above  Twisp.  It  has  a
Lookout and the cutest little trail cattle guard. I didn\'t  know  they  came
that small. I did get rained on as the weather had  deteriorated  (3  miles,
1200 ft, 1:30 hrs RT). But I also missed the traffic.

Tatoosh Lakes Quad1 (5880+ ft - P520 - Tatoosh Lakes Quad) - June 3, 2010

I originally didn\'t think I would bother writing a TR for this peak  in  the
Tatoosh Wilderness as I expected it to be  an  unpleasant  brush  bash  that
would interest few people. However, it turned out to be  such  an  enjoyable
and easy little climb I just had to  pass  it  on.  And  the  views  of  the
backside of the Tatoosh Range from the summit are quite stunning.  The  only
real problem is the access road (5260) leaving Skate Cr  Rd  52  at  Johnson
Cr. I was able to drive it 4 miles to the switchback at 3560 ft (stopped  by
snow here) in my Jeep but parts of it are  very  rough  with  several  creek
fords, near washouts and much water damage. The last  mile  is  particularly
rutted and bad. A few more heavy  rain  storms  and  it  may  no  longer  be
passable.

From the switchback I hiked the road .4 mile to a spur just before a  creek.
I tried following this spur but it is so overgrown it is of no help  and  it
is best to just go uphill alongside the creek. The  first  part  was  a  bit
brushy until leaving the second growth  but  it  was  short.  Then  pleasant
brushless forest in the wilderness was easily ascended to an open  basin  at
4600 ft. Snow was solid in the woods. The basin showed  evidence  of  recent
climax avalanches all the way down to dirt. Goat trails led through a  short
bare cliffy section to an upper snow  basin  and  the  SE  ridge  which  was
followed over the false summit to the  true  summit.  The  higher  snow  was
still soft and slushy but snowshoes were not needed (nor taken).

Total: 4 miles and 2700 ft RT. 3 hours up, 1:25 hours down  and  a  glorious
hour on the summit basking in the sun.

Oh, does anyone have a name for this peak? It certainly deserves one. I  did
build a cairn and leave a register (but not a name).

Monday, June 7 - After the long drive and eating lunch in my  car  I  didn\'t
get started on the War Cr trail until  2:00.  That  gave  time  for  morning
showers to improve to afternoon sunshine. My original plan was to go up  the
South Fork trail and climb Sun Mtn and Black Ridge. But I couldn\'t find  the
start of this unmaintained trail.  That was probably just  as  well  because
even if I could I would have had trouble crossing  War  Creek  which  was  a
raging torrent. Anticipating this could be a problem, it was on to Plan B  -
stay on the main War Cr trail and climb peaks near War Cr Pass.

I met a WTA work party coming out that had  logged  the  trail  to  about  3
miles. Past that were a few logs but the trail  was  in  pretty  good  shape
overall. The many small  creek  crossings  were  more  of  a  problem.  Snow
started around 5000 ft and became solid around 5800 ft. At 5  miles  I  came
across the sturdy War Creek Cabin (elev 4600 ft). I didn\'t  even  know  this
cabin existed. It is in excellent condition with a wood stove and  plentiful
supply of firewood. I was tempted to stay at the cabin but I  really  wanted
to get closer to my objectives.  I  began  to  regret  this  decision  after
pushing another 3.5 miles and ending up having a hard time  finding  a  snow
free site for my tent. I was becoming resigned to camping on snow  (which  I
really didn\'t want to do) when I stumbled upon a level spot under a tree  at
6000 ft (8.5 miles, 3200 ft, 6 hrs).

Tuesday, June 8 - After a very comfortable night, I started for Talus  Butte
at 7:00. The snow in the open had  frozen  overnight  enough  that  crampons
would have been useful, but since I didn\'t bring any I stayed off  the  more
direct steep south slope and instead  went  up  the  SE  ridge.  The  summit
itself was melted out to where I could build a cairn and  leave  a  register
(1600 ft, 1:40 hr). The snow was  beginning  to  soften  in  the  sun  as  I
descended the S  ridge  heading  for  Boulder  Butte.  So  much  so  that  I
occasionally broke through into a thigh  deep  hole.  Snowshoes  might  have
helped. Then again maybe not as in places the snow was so rotten and  hollow
that even a snowshoe would have broken  through,  all  a  moot  point  as  I
didn\'t bring any. There was evidence of  fresh  snow  and  weird  conditions
above 7000 ft.

I followed the S ridge to its low point  intending  to  traverse  around  Pt
6659 on the W side and a direct route to  Boulder  Butte.  This  had  looked
good from Talus. Looks  can  be  deceiving.  When  I  actually  got  to  the
traverse it was quite steep and still icy so a no go for me. Instead I  took
a circuitous route dropping and traversing on the sunny  E  side  and  going
through War Cr Pass. Once at the pass it was easy going  to  the  summit  of
Boulder Butte (2800, 4:30 hr). This summit  is  a  marvelous  viewpoint  for
every direction and with a warm sunny snow free  spot  to  hang  out  at,  I
thoroughly enjoyed my stay. I really didn\'t want to  leave.  I  particularly
liked the view across Lake Chelan to the Devore Cr peaks.

My last peak of the day was Splawn Mtn. I  descended  to  Lake  Juanita  and
traversed a long way around Pt 7252 and another bump until I could gain  the
W ridge to the summit (3800 ft, 7:30 hr). By now I  could  see  the  weather
changing as it began clouding up. The forecast  was  for  rain  tonight  and
tomorrow. My thought was to get as  far  as  the  cabin  tonight  and  avoid
spending a wet night out. First I  had  to  get  back  to  camp.  It  seemed
shorter and faster to take a direct line down rather than return the  way  I
had come through War Cr Pass. To this end I descended to the saddle  on  the
W ridge and dropped off the N side into the War Cr drainage. I am  not  sure
I gained much by doing this as I ran into some very steep  terrain  and  had
to wander a bit to find a way down. Even  so  I  ended  up  making  2  short
rappels. I then had to traverse  up  and  down  across  several  basins  and
gullies.  It took 1:40 hr to reach my tent (7 miles, 4100 ft, 9:40 hr RT).

I had a snack and a half hour nap before packing up and leaving at  6:00.  I
made the cabin at 7:40. That was sooner than expected and I figured I  still
had a good 2 hours of daylight left so I just kept going  and  darned  if  I
didn\'t make the TH without needing my headlamp  at  9:45  (8.5  miles,  3:45
hr). I spent the night in my car. I was awakened sometime during  the  night
to the sound of rain.

Total: 24 miles and 7400 ft in 2 days

I did these two peaks after my War Cr Pass trip and spending  the  night  at
the War Cr TH and before  driving  home.  They  were  surprisingly  pleasant
little peaks with  both  summits  open  and  offering  nice  views  in  good
weather. But I had clouds and drizzle. I drove road 800  off  Buttermilk  Cr
Rd 43 about 5 miles to a berm Â¼ mile before the Saddle between N & M  Newby.
The road is rough in spots but not  too  bad  and  better  than  I  expected
considering it is little used. I was in my Jeep though. I  passed  2  gates.
The first was closed but not locked. It had a sign that said  "Please  close
gate" which implies to me public access is permitted. The second  was  open.
Cattle were grazing in the area.

I climbed N first. Some annoying snowbrush and small downed  trees.  An  old
road winds its way up E side and I crossed it twice but probably  easier  to
just go uphill. 500 ft and 37 minutes RT.

Back to car for  M.  Followed  road  and  dropped  to  saddle.  Fence  here.
Traversed around 4041 on way there. (Went over it on way back.)  Dropped  to
next saddle. Fairly good roads intersect at the fence here. May be  able  to
drive to this point. Not sure where to pick  up  these  roads  but  probably
from Newby Cr. Easily follow along fence on path  to  top.  Must  cross  the
fence to Access summit. 1000 ft and 1:30 RT.

Bears Breast Mtn (7197 ft - P1117 - Mt Daniel Quad) - June 12-14, 2010

This trip almost ended at the TH for me. But I am getting ahead  of  myself.
Stefan had researched  an  unproven  route  approaching  Bears  Breast  from
Shovel Lake. This route required snow cover to work best. He  had  tried  to
set it up last spring several times but was thwarted by bad weather so  when
a window of 3 good days appeared this spring he was ready  to  go.  He  also
wanted to come in from Fish Lake going over Cathedral Pass to  pick  up  The
Citadel and Mons Venus on the way to Shovel Lake. Carla and  Franklin  would
join him on this route. Since I had already done those two peaks I  was  not
interested and would approach alone via  the  less  strenuous  Waptus  River
Trail. We would meet at the inlet to Shovel Lake where his  route  up  Bears
Breast started.

Saturday, June 12 - I was at the Waptus River TH (2400  ft)  all  packed  up
ready to go and filling out my  camping  permit  when  I  just  happened  to
glance at the reader board and notice a  not  altogether  obvious  old  sign
(probably from last summer) that stated:

"Hiker bridge over the Waptus River  is  washed  out.  The  only  access  to
Waptus Lake is via the 2 foot deep horse ford."

I couldn\'t believe my eyes. I had crossed the hiker bridge in  the  fall  of
2005 when I had climbed Mons  Venus  from  Spade  Lake.  It  was  a  massive
structure built on rock walls well above the river. It never occurred to  me
that it could be washed out. Well apparently it could be and  it  had  been.
What to do now? It was too late to  join  Stefan  on  his  way  in  and  the
alternate via Pete Lake and  the  PCT  involved  extra  elevation  and  snow
travel that I wasn\'t mentally prepared for. Despite the fact that I  have  a
great fear of river crossings and I was certain the  ford  would  be  deeper
than 2 feet this time of year, I decided to just go see for  myself.  Either
I could get across the river or I couldn\'t. I did add trail  shoes  to  hike
in and use for wading so my boots would stay dry.

The day was sunny and hot and I started in shorts. I hiked the  8  miles  to
the  ford,  crossing  many  high  side  creeks  on  the  way,  in   complete
uncertainty while in constant view of the  raging  Waptus  River.  How  ever
would I get to the other side? But when I came to the ford it looked  to  be
within the realm of possibility. It was  at  a  very  wide  (maybe  200  ft)
relatively shallow spot. I couldn\'t really tell how deep it was  but  I  was
sure it was over 2 feet. And while not white water the  current  was  swift.
What decided me to give it a try  was  a  sturdy  rope  strung  between  the
banks. Without that I don\'t think I would have attempted it. The  water  was
up to my crotch but with the rope for support I never felt close  to  losing
it. The water was cold but not unbearable. I  was  elated  when  I  made  it
across. Somehow I blocked out the fact that I would have to do it  again  on
the return. I would worry about that later.

I had striped to my underwear and continued hiking in  it  to  dry  it  out.
Much to my surprise I passed several campers along Waptus Lake.  However,  I
had run into horse packers coming out which would explain that.   I  wish  I
had met them at the crossing as I would have paid them big bucks to take  me
across. I continued on very wet trail sloshing through  all  the  water.  It
was really quite liberating not to have to worry about keeping my feet  dry.
I began running into the odd snow patch. I missed the  obscure  junction  to
the Shovel Lake way trail and ended up at the PCT  crossing  of  the  Waptus
River above Waptus Lake. This  bridge  is  intact.  At  that  point  I  just
wandered in the woods until I stumbled upon the way trail. I passed  a  nice
campsite at 3200 ft that I noted for possible use on the return and  stopped
to change into dry socks and boots and put my shorts on again.

The way trail steepened as it climbed a wooded rib beside Shovel Creek  then
ended as it dropped into the talus filled canyon. The  next  mile  was  slow
tedious rock hopping with unreliable snow patches to  the  outlet  waterfall
of Shovel lake. I rounded the waterfall on  the  right  and  entered  Shovel
Lake Basin. And just like that I went from summer  to  winter.  Up  to  this
point it had been sunny and hot and I was still comfortable in  shorts.  The
lake is only 4138 ft and I had hoped for  at  the  very  least  a  few  bare
spots. But it  was  all  in  shade,  completely  snow  covered  and  like  a
refrigerator. I hiked the remaining longer than it  looked  distance  around
the east shore to the designated meeting spot  at  the  inlet,  arriving  at
8:00 (14 miles, 3100 ft, 9:30 hrs). There was no sign of  the  rest  of  the
party. I began to get worried. I really thought they would beat me here.

Even though I knew our route started from the west side of the  inlet  creek
I could see no way across other than wading and by now I was much  too  cold
to attempt this. I quickly changed into warm clothes and set up my  tent  on
the east side. I was lamenting the  fact  that  I  had  forgotten  the  fuel
canister for my stove and was eating a cold dinner when much  to  my  relief
Stefan, Carla and Franklin showed up at 9:00, tired and wet. They too  could
see no way across the inlet creek. We would deal with that  problem  in  the
morning.

Sunday, June 13 - Our revised plan was to pack up camp, hike to the  outlet,
leave overnight gear there, cross  (there  was  a  snow  bridge  there)  and
backtrack on the west side of the lake to the route.  We  started  from  the
outlet at 7:45. The route up to the base of Bears Breast  went  quite  well.
Other than a couple of steep sections through short cliff bands, it was  all
on nice snow.

We reached the notch below the rock at 11:00. Here we spent  about  an  hour
basking in the sun, drying out boots and warming cold feet. Then Stefan  led
off in rock shoes. The rest of us were in boots. There was  much  rope  drag
and cursing on the first pitch. Frankln went next carrying the second  rope.
Then Carla went on a prusik on the fixed rope while Franklin belayed  Stefan
on the second pitch. By the time Carla belayed me up, Franklin was ready  to
go up the rope protected by an ascender. Then I was belayed on one rope  and
Carla on the other after me. Up to now I could  not  see  the  upper  route.
When I rounded the corner into  the  chimney  pitch,  I  gasped.  It  looked
frightfully steep and difficult. There was a small snow patch  at  the  base
and solid ice in the floor. The whole pitch gave me  trouble.  I  pulled  on
slings to get over a bulge and then got  stuck  in  the  chimney.  I  didn\'t
rotate soon enough and my pack got caught.  Somehow,  after  much  thrashing
and using all of my limited arm strength I  pulled  myself  through.  Easier
cracks continued to a rappel station. From here  we  unroped  and  scrambled
the remaining short distance to the summit at 2:45 (3100 ft, 7 hrs from  the
outlet).

Two double rappels got us back to the notch and much glissading back to  the
outlet and our overnight packs. It was now 6:30 and we  hoped  to  get  down
Shovel Creek to the nice camp at 3200 ft I noticed the day before.  This  we
did reaching it at 7:45 (6 miles, 3300 ft, 12:45 hrs total for the day).  It
is amazing the difference 1000 ft can  make.  Shovel  Lake  camp  was  solid
snow, cold and damp. This one was bare, warm  and  dry.  A  constant  breeze
even dried most of our gear, excepting the boots.

Monday, June 14 - More revisions.  Stefan had originally planned  to  return
to his car at Fish Lake via the PCT and Deep Lake, but none of  them  wanted
to slog uphill in snow. It would be snow free and shorter to return with  me
down the Waptus River Trail. I for one was delighted to  have  the  company.
Of course there was the "small" problem of  the  river  crossing.  I  really
expected the water level to be lower this time around. At  9:00  am  it  was
earlier and the day was cooler and cloudy, at least to start,  than  it  had
been on Saturday. Well it wasn\'t  lower.  In  fact  it  was  several  inches
higher coming almost to my waist and this time I felt the current trying  to
take me away and without that rope to hang onto,  it  very  well  may  have.
After that it was just a matter of hiking 8 long miles. Carla, Franklin  and
I reached the TH a little before 2:00 (12 miles, 1250 ft, 6:45 hrs),  Stefan
an hour earlier.

I then drove Stefan to his car. By the way, the road to Fish  Lake  is  full
of potholes and in terrible shape, the worst I have ever seen  it.  And  the
Scatter Creek ford was running quite high. It took 2 hours RT to  drive  the
11 miles.  We then stopped for well deserved burgers at Old #3 in Ronald.

This was the first extended trip I had taken with Carla and Franklin  and  I
greatly enjoyed their humor and company.

Total: 32 miles and 7600 ft in 3 days

Tuesday, June 22 - After a 4.5 hour drive I arrived at the  South  Cr  TH  at
1:30 to a large group assembling gear. Upon talking with the leader, a  very
nice young man from Mazama by the way, I learned this was an  Outward  Bound
party going up South Creek, over McAlester Mtn  and  out  Rennie  Creek.  My
experience with large groups has not been all that pleasant over the  years.
Upon expressing concern we might be occupying the  same  area  at  the  same
time, the leader assured me not to worry. They were out for 13  days,  would
get no farther than 3 miles up the trail the first day and would be  nowhere
near McAlester for several more days. They left before  I  did  but  I  soon
caught and passed them and then never saw them again. I must say  they  were
one of the quietest and best behaved large groups I have met.  But  I  still
think encountering 12 people off trail in  a  wilderness  rather  diminishes
that "Wilderness Experience" the Powers-That-Be are so  eager  to  otherwise
protect.

The South Creek Trail is very nice and well maintained and I enjoyed  hiking
easily along until I came to the first  major  side  creek.  I  saw  no  way
across without wading. Now I had brought trail shoes, thinking to  only  use
them in camp. Or maybe I had a premonition, though I really didn\'t  think  I
would have a problem crossing creeks on this trail. But it  is  not  like  I
haven\'t had experience with this of late. So I changed  to  trail  shoes  to
wade across. I had two more creeks to wade, one over my  knees  and  running
so fast it sought to push me  off  balance.  Fortunately  it  was  short.  I
sloshed the rest of the way in wet feet. I should be getting used to this.

I began running into snow in the woods just past the third crossing at  5000
ft but it became bare again when the trail switchbacked  up  an  open  south
facing hillside above South Creek. It was sunny and quite  warm.  Where  the
trail entered woods again near the creek  draining  Banshee\'s  south  slopes
snow reappeared but I found a nice bare campsite  just  big  enough  for  my
little tent near the creek, elev 5840 ft (6.5 miles, 2800 ft, 4:30  hrs).  I
am sure there are better sites available when all the snow is  gone.  I  had
plenty of time to have a leisurely dinner and enjoy a lovely evening.

Wednesday, June 23 - Starting at 7:00, I  was  able  to  follow  the  mostly
snowcovered trail all the way to South Pass. It  had  not  frozen  overnight
and the snow remained soft. From South Pass I climbed  the  north  ridge  to
Peak 7045 (1200 ft, 2 hrs) and continued down the south ridge to  the  broad
saddle with McAlester. I could see no  direct  route  to  McAlester  but  it
looked, from a distance, as if I  could  access  the  east  ridge  from  the
saddle with Gibbs. However, when I got closer I saw the  entire  saddle  was
guarded by large overhanging cornices with no  way  up.  My  only  hope  was
where the cornice thinned higher on the far right. This ended  up  the  crux
of the climb. The cornice here had lessened to a 5 foot  vertical  wall  but
was doable by chopping away at it for 15 minutes. Once on the ridge  it  was
easy going though the sight of overhanging cornices  was  both  breathtaking
and scary.

At the intersection of the east ridge with the south  ridge  the  route  was
bare rock to the false summit. A fun 25 minute  scramble  along  the  narrow
crest led to the true summit (2650 ft, 5:45 hr). Here  I  found  a  register
that looked suspiciously like one of mine but it had been placed by  copycat
Steve Fox in October, 2002.

I returned to the saddle with Peak 7045. I had thought I could  bypass  this
peak by contouring around but the distant view from McAlester  showed  cliff
bands and steep sidehill. It was  easier  to  go  over  the  top  again.  My
original plan was to return to camp and climb Banshee  from  there  tomorrow
morning. But it was still so early I decided to  continue  on  the  inviting
looking ridge that led from South Pass toward that peak. This  plan  started
out well but what I couldn\'t see was that Pt 6869 hid a 250 ft drop  on  the
other side and I couldn\'t follow  the  ridge  the  whole  way  due  to  rock
pinnacles and steep terrain. I had to make another  250  ft  drop  into  the
south basin. Still it was a very scenic and enjoyable route. From the  basin
easy snow slopes led to the SW ridge past the pinnacles. The  summit  itself
was bare so I built a cairn and left a register (5000 ft, 11:20 hrs).

The  day  had  started  sunny  but  had  clouded  up   by   afternoon   with
thunderheads. It threatened serious thundershowers all around me on the  way
up Banshee and I was quite worried (in fact I heard  one  place  in  Eastern
Washington had 6 inches of hail), but nothing ever materialized. I was  darn
lucky. By the time I returned to camp at 7:50 the sun was shining  again  (7
miles, 5000 ft, 12:50 hrs).

Thursday, June 24 - This morning dawned sunny and hot. I left for  the  easy
trip out at 8:30. About Â½ mile down  the  trail  the  tracks  of  many  feet
coming up suddenly appeared, but not before. The NOLS group must  have  left
the trail somewhere around here. I have no idea where they went and I  never
heard or saw them. As I said before they were  uncommonly  quiet.  My  trail
shoes had dried yesterday but my boots were soaked from  being  all  day  on
wet snow so I waded the three creeks in my boots and put on dry trail  shoes
for the rest of the trip out, a real luxury (6.5 miles, 3:30 hrs).

Total: 20 miles and 7800 ft in 3 days

An annual extended 4th of July trip  to  the  Lake  Chelan  area  with  Jim,
Eileen and Beth seems to becoming a tradition. This year we were  joined  by
father/daughter Steve and Lisa Dittmar. The main event was for  5  days  but
both Beth and I lengthened our stay to pick up additional peaks.

Friday, July 2: Tenmile Pass - The trip did not  start  well  when  Jim  and
Eileen literally missed the boat. I won\'t embarrass them by explaining  why.
We remaining four took the Lady II and bus to Holden while  Jim  and  Eileen
scrambled for alternate transportation  via  float  plane.  Steve  and  Lisa
elected to wait for their delayed arrival in Holden while Beth and I  forged
on up the trail to Tenmile Pass. At the campsite at 4600 ft and the  end  of
maintained trail, Tenmile Cr was running too high to wade  but  we  found  a
nice log 15 minutes upstream. Traversing  back  downstream  once  across  we
intersected the way trail leading to the main  trail  at  5200  ft.  In  the
middle of the path at 5800 ft we found a note left by Stefan the day  before
giving his itinerary. I  had  prior  knowledge  he  would  be  in  the  area
climbing multiple summits and that we might run into him. We  soon  came  to
continuous snow but found bare ground for camping on the  ridge  just  above
6500 ft Tenmile Pass (5 miles, 3400 ft, 5:30 hrs).

Saturday, July 3, Morning: Johnson\'s Jonah - Beth and I figured  the  others
wouldn\'t arrive before noon, so we  headed  off  to  climb  Johnson\'s  Jonah
which we figured could be done in half a day. This turned out to be  a  very
enjoyable scramble along the ridge from Pt 7409,  not  as  difficult  as  it
appeared, and mostly class 2-3. We also got a  very  nice  view  of  Riddle,
which looked more difficult than  expected,  and  decided  the  easiest  way
appeared to be up the SW Ridge. When we arrived back  in  camp  at  2:15  (3
miles, 1900 ft, 5:40 hrs RT), the others had arrived and set  up  camp  next
to ours.

Saturday, July 3, Afternoon: Riddle Pk - The six of us  started  for  Riddle
at 2:45, climbing and traversing below the cliffs of the NW Ridge to the  SW
Ridge. A scramble up a loose gully led to a notch  where  Jim  discovered  a
nifty hidden ledge system on the other side that bypassed pinnacles.  Easier
terrain followed to the false summit with a final slightly  tricky  traverse
past a remnant cornice to the true summit. We spent 30 pleasant  minutes  on
top and not finding a register I left one of mine. Before leaving  we  heard
shouting from the Riddle Cr basin. That could only  be  the  incredible  Mr.
Feller who saw us silhouetted against the sky from his camp below.  We  were
back in camp by 8:30 for a prolonged communal dinner and  social  hour  (2.5
miles, 1800 ft, 5:45 hrs RT).

Sunday, July 4: Puzzle Pk - While the other three slept in, Jim, Beth and  I
started together at 7:00, they to do Flora and I to do  Puzzle.  I  had  run
out of time last year when I did Enigma and  Castle.  While  I  would  never
have made a special return trip just for this minor  peak,  it  gave  me  an
excuse to accompany my friends most of the  way  to  Flora  with  the  added
incentive of something new to climb. I have  done  everything  else  in  the
area.

We dropped from Tenmile Pass and traversed steep but  thankfully  soft  snow
to the basin below North and Main Riddle. Then came an  unpleasant  somewhat
brushy traverse taken at 5700 ft to gain the gully north  of  North  Riddle.
Jim  and  I  became  separated  from  Beth  on  this   section   and   heard
unintelligible shouting from below. When we connected once again  with  Beth
we discovered she had incredibly run into Stefan. He  was  on  his  way  out
intending to catch the boat today. I was really disappointed to have  missed
him.

We gained the gully easily climbing  to  the  7040  ft  Devore-Riddle  Pass,
dropped  on  the  other  side  several  hundred  feet  and  climbed  to  the
indistinct 7440 ft Riddle-Castle Pass. Here we  parted  company.  I  dropped
all the way to Castle Creek Basin at 6400 ft before beginning  a  long  flat
traverse past Enigma and scrambling very loose gullies to  the  saddle  with
Puzzle. Once on the narrow ridge it seemed to  take  forever  to  reach  the
summit. It didn\'t help that the weather was not  the  best.  Visibility  was
not bad but a truly icy and gusty wind threatened to blow me off the  ridge.
It was so cold I had to resort to climbing in my down jacket. I reached  the
summit at 2:15 (3600 ft, 7:10 hr).

Since it had taken much longer than anticipated on the  interminable  ridge,
I was sure Jim and Beth had beat me back to the Castle-Riddle Pass.  We  had
agree not to wait for each other. But we actually reached  the  pass  within
minutes of each other (what timing!)  and thus could  retreat  together.  We
all pulled into camp around 9:15, dead  tired  (10  miles,  6250  ft,  14:10
hrs). It had been a cold, windy and inhospitable place all  day  (and  still
was) and Steve and Lisa had decided to call it a trip  and  go  out.  I  was
sorry they left as I had looked forward to more  time  together.   But  they
seemed satisfied with Riddle and I sure can\'t blame them for not wanting  to
hang around camp in such conditions. We all ate  dinner  separately  in  the
shelter of our respective tents.

Monday, July 5: Black Tower Attempt - It has been said  that  summer  starts
July 5 around here.  Right  on  cue,  Nature  flipped  a  switch  and  after
yesterday\'s wintry blast, today started a string of  increasingly  warm  and
sunny days. Jim, Eileen and Beth decided to break camp  intending  to  spend
the night at the 4600 ft forest  camp  along  Tenmile  Cr  after  attempting
Black Tower. I, on the other hand, wanted one more camp  at  scenic  Tenmile
Pass. This, plus a general lack of energy by all but Eileen, led to  a  late
start of 10:30. We reached the way trail junction an hour later,  where  the
others left their overnight  gear,  and  then  continued  on  the  trail  to
Hilgard Pass. We were all blown away by the beauty of the  basin  below  the
pass which was ablaze with an endless field of  yellow  Glacier  Lilies.  We
vowed to return next year and camp in this lovely spot. We  reached  Hilgard
Pass at 2:30 from where we started for  Black  Tower.  We  had  intended  to
climb the easier route on the SW face but  somehow  ended  up  climbing  the
snow couloir to the notch on the South Ridge. The route from  this  side  is
more difficult. We did one scramble  pitch  followed  by  a  roped  class  5
pitch, led by Jim. Increasingly difficult scrambling  loomed  above  and  it
became clear we simply didn\'t have the time to do the route  and  so  pulled
the plug at 7:00. A double rope rappel got us back to the notch at 8:00  and
the trail junction at 9:45 where I left my friends to  plod  slowly  up  the
trail by headlamp reaching my camp at 11:15.

Total for day: 10 miles, 4150 ft, 12:45 hrs

Tuesday, July 6: Hart Lake - I awoke at 8:30 enjoying  my  scenic  spot  for
another gorgeous morning before  leisurely  packing  up  and  heading  down,
making Holden at 2:00 (5 miles,  150  ft,  3:30  hr).  I  had  a  refreshing
shower, changed to clean clothes and reorganized gear. Jim and  Eileen  were
long gone on the Lady Express but I did run into  Beth.  She  was  taking  a
rest day in Holden before climbing Martin. I probably should have  done  the
same as by the time I started up the trail to Hart  Lake  in  the  afternoon
heat at 4:00 I was positively dragging. In addition the heat brought  out  a
swarm  of  mosquitoes  that  had  been  kept  at  bay  previously  by   cold
temperatures. It was only 4.5 flat easy miles to  the  lake  but  I  was  so
tired it took much longer than it should have (4.5 miles, 800  ft,  3  hrs).
I began to worry if I would have enough energy left to climb any  peaks  the
next day. I hoped a good night\'s rest would work its magic.

Wednesday, July 7: North Star Mtn and Cloudy Pk - I did feel better  in  the
morning but not a whole lot. Resident deer had  awakened  me  several  times
wandering around camp during the night and despite  hanging  my  food  high,
savvy rodents had chewed a hole in my  food  bag.  Critters  conditioned  to
associating people with goodies are why I like  to  avoid  camping  in  well
established sites.

I had hoped to find a direct route to North Star, but as I continued up  the
trail all I saw was thick brush and cliffs.  I  was  beginning  to  think  I
would have go almost all the way to Cloudy Pass (5.5 miles from  Hart  Lake)
when I came to a talus slope at 5200 ft that offered  a  possible  route  up
saving a little distance. This it did but not without some  difficulties  of
brush, wet slabs and skirting waterfalls. Once  above  these  it  was  clear
sailing and I found renewed energy on easy snow to  the  final  scramble  up
North Star. There were two survey markers on  top  but  no  register.  North
Star is in the shadow of Bonanza and has a stunning view of the SW  side  of
this much higher peak.

From North Star I headed for Cloudy, but first I  had  to  get  through  the
cliffs of its South Ridge. I traversed a long way under them looking  for  a
weakness. I saw several places that might go later in  the  season  but  now
they were still capped by large cornices. In fact it occurred  to  me  there
was some danger from falling cornices on this very hot day and I moved  past
them as fast as I could. I eventually found a crossing on  rock  much  lower
down at 7400 ft and proceeded up the easy ridge to the  summit  block.  This
summit had an unexpected short  class  3/4  pitch  made  more  difficult  by
remnant snow. But the rock was good and the climbing fun.

I was now in position to quickly descend the gentle  open  south  slopes  of
Cloudy Pk to Lyman Lake where I picked up the trail. I returned to  my  camp
at Hart Lake at 7:30 after washing in the creek just before. All the  creeks
were running quite high by now but this is  such  a  well  maintained  trail
that crossings were always possible without  wading  or  getting  feet  wet.
Camp was occupied by several other parties, one of which had a huge  bonfire
going. Since it was still quite warm, I  assume  this  was  either  for  the
ambience or to keep bugs away. As for me I avoided  the  biting  insects  by
sealing myself in my tent (12.5 miles, 5050 ft, 11 hrs).

Thursday, July 8: Holden - Today was even hotter but I got  an  early  start
at 6:45 to beat the heat and bugs and because of this enjoyed the  hike  out
much more than the one in. I reached Holden in plenty of time to  clean  up,
check out the store and make the bus for the Lady Express  (4.5  miles,  250
ft, 2 hrs).

Grand total: 57 miles and 23,750 ft in 7 days

There has to be an easier way up Devils Pk but I sure didn\'t find it. It  is
certainly appropriately named as only the Devil would feel at home  on  this
evil looking peak of terrible scree, loose  rock,  endless  ridge  pinnacles
and multiple nasty gullies. A dusty  of  fresh  snow  making  for  wet  rock
didn\'t help either.

Monday, July 12: Camp on Robinson Cr  -  I  hiked  6.5  miles  on  the  easy
Robinson Cr trail to a pleasant camp at the edge of a meadow, elev 4800  ft.
The trail crosses Robinson Cr twice and Beauty  Cr  all  on  large  bridges.
However the first bridge has been damaged and horses are banned  from  using
it. I saw three large  peeled  logs  harvested  from  and  lying  in  nearby
forest, presumably to soon replace this bridge. I  was  just  glad  the  old
bridge was still usable by  foot  as  I  would  have  had  trouble  crossing
otherwise. The third crossing of Robinson Cr was by log  but  that  was  far
enough upstream it was no great  problem.  It  was  sunny  and  hot  when  I
started at 1:30 but a forecast marine push made its appearance  as  the  day
wore on and temperatures took a dive so that about halfway along  I  had  to
change to long pants and warmer clothes. It was also very windy and  by  the
time I put up my tent it was drizzling. I had hoped to scope out  the  route
up Devils Pk but the poor visibility precluded this so I turned in early.

Total for day: 6.5 miles, 2200 ft and 5 hrs

Tuesday, July 13: Devils Pk - I awoke at 5:30 to light  rain.  I  guess  the
marine push was stronger than expected as real precipitation  had  not  been
predicted. At least the wind had abated. It did stop raining but  everything
was now wet as I started at 8:00. I was also dismayed to see  a  dusting  of
fresh snow high up. I left the trail about .7 miles up trail  from  camp  at
an open meadow, elev 5100 ft, heading for the west  ridge.  The  meadow  was
topped by wet brush some of which I avoided by heading  into  trees  on  the
left. I was soon funneled into a loose  scree  gully  and  more  loose  open
scree slopes above that. I kept thinking it would get better. It didn\'t.  It
only got looser and steeper, the kind of scree where  for  every  two  steps
forward you fall back one.  It  was  not  difficult,  just  frustrating  and
exhausting. I reached the base of the cliffs at  11:40  and  now  the  "fun"
really started.

I basically had no knowledge of the  route.  Beckey\'s  description  of  "the
ascent (from the W side) does not appear  to  offer  technical  difficulties
but will include talus and broken rock slopes"  is  totally  useless  and  I
didn\'t believe it for a minute. All you have to do  is  look  at  the  close
contours on the map and you know there will be problems. I did read  the  TR
of Stefan\'s climb with Greg but he approached from Slate Pass  and  Robinson
Pass and ended up bypassing pinnacles by going up  from  the  basin  on  the
north, far from my approach. So  I  really  didn\'t  know  where  to  go  and
wandered all over the mountain trying to  find  a  way,  making  many  false
starts that dead ended.

What follows is a condensed version of the way I went (not  to  be  confused
with a "route"). From the highest point of  the  scree  I  entered  a  steep
gully via a narrow ledge and  followed  this  to  notch  1.  The  ridge  was
impassible. I descended a hundred feet or so and  traversed  into  the  next
gully going  to  notch  2  and  another  dead-end.  I  descended  again  and
traversed broken face rock to the ridge and the top of a  pinnacle  which  I
rappelled off of to notch 3 and more  frightful  impassable  pinnacles.  You
would think I would have learned by this time that the ridge didn\'t  go  and
to stay away from it. I descended again farther until I could  make  a  long
traverse into a final gully that led directly to  the  summit  (3600  ft,  7
hrs). I found the climbing  interesting  and  challenging  but  not  exactly
enjoyable. While it was mostly class 3, with maybe a  little  class  4  here
and there, and not above my comfort level, the rock  was  very  loose,  wet,
slick and did not inspire a lot of confidence. At some point I  knew  I  had
probably reached the point of no return. I could not easily reverse  what  I
had done and my best course of action was to  make  the  summit  to  find  a
better way down.

It was now 3:20 and I was worried about getting down. I  was  relieved  when
the SE ridge looked reasonable as a descent route but looking at the  map  I
knew I would run into problems in  the  steep  gullies  lower  down.  Things
actually went better than I expected. I found a gully that took me  most  of
the way down and only had to do two rappels on  my  100  ft  rope  near  the
bottom where it steepened. More loose gully - golly gosh but I  was  getting
sick of loose gullies - some forest, some brush, some meadow and I  stumbled
upon the trail at 6:30 (3 hrs from the summit).

Ten minutes later I was in camp where I discovered an  Outward  Bound  group
had set up housekeeping a few hundred feet from my tent.  I  can\'t  seem  to
escape these large groups. But again the leader was a very nice young  woman
from Mazama and we had a pleasant chat. She was interested in  my  climb  of
Devils Pk and although she had not climbed it herself  she  seemed  familiar
with its reputation and aware of some of the difficulties. She also told  me
to let her know if  the  group  bothered  me  or  made  too  much  noise.  I
appreciated that. As it turned out there was no problem. We  were  separated
by trees and I was close enough to the  creek  that  it  masked  any  noise.
Besides I was so tired I slept like the dead.

Total for day: 4 miles, 3600 ft and 10:30 hrs

Wednesday, July 14: "Devils View", Pk 7280+ - I really wanted  a  good  view
of Devils Pk and so climbed this peak on the other side  of  the  valley  to
get it. Okay, I admit that it being a new summit  was  an  added  incentive.
What a contrast this pleasant little peak was. The  weather  was  good,  the
brush dry and the green meadows  balm  for  my  eyes  (and  feet).  I  won\'t
mention the 1000 feet of brush I had to bash to get to the good  stuff,  but
that was minor in comparison to loose gullies (3 miles, 2500  ft,  5:30  hrs
RT from camp).

Trip Total: 20 miles and 8300 ft in 3 days

Stonesthrow Pk (5823 ft - P423 - Mt Skokomish Quad) - July 17-18, 2010

I accompanied Jim, Eileen and Jim A on a delightful trip to climb Mt  Stone.
 I had climbed Mt Stone (and Mt Skokomish) in August 1997 but  I  remembered
it as so enjoyable that I was looking forward to a repeat,  this  time  with
good company. Jim had also been up Stone but Eileen had  not.  As  an  added
incentive there was a smaller peak to the NW that I had not done.

We hiked the steep Putvin Trail to snowed in Lake of the Angels and  set  up
camp on the only flat snowfree strip of ground in the basin (4  miles,  3500
ft, 4.5 hrs). Almost immediately we were visited by a curious  family  of  5
goats. Two were adorable kids that kept us all entertained for  20  minutes.
Jim A stayed in camp while Jim, Eileen and I headed for Stone  at  3:45.  It
was every bit as much fun as  I  remembered.  The  rock  is  classic  pillow
basalt (that geologist Jim couldn\'t get enough of) and offers  some  of  the
best rock climbing in the Olympics. Unfortunately, by the  time  we  reached
the summit at 5:45 marine air had rolled in and views were restricted.  Even
so we hung out for a good thirty minutes reading the large  summit  register
and catching the occasional glimpse of the rugged ridge to the middle  peak.
We were back in camp by 8:00 for a merry dinner (1700 ft, 4:15 hrs RT).

The next morning dawned with an extremely heavy dew  but  clear  and  sunny.
After a leisurely breakfast, Jim Eileen and I headed  to  the  SW  ridge  of
Stone, I to get to Stonesthrow, the other two for the views. They  ended  up
climbing a pinnacle on the ridge while I looked for  way  off  it  into  the
valley to the west. The ridge is quite cliffy but I  found  a  steep  narrow
snowfinger leading down that I used crampons for. Once in the valley it  was
a walk up to the saddle with Stone and then easy snow slopes to  my  summit.
Near the saddle I hear shouting and saw Jim and Eileen  silhouetted  on  one
of the pinnacles. It looked quite impressive. I had a great view of  the  NW
side of Stone from my summit and I lounged  in  the  warm  sun  for  a  hour
enjoying it all. On the way back I took a more direct route over  the  ridge
that avoided the snowfinger but did require a 50 ft rappel  to  descend  the
other side to. I reached camp at 1:30, the others long gone (1800  ft,  4:40
hrs RT), and left at 2:30.

I was descending the Putvin trail about 30 minutes from the T, alone  in  my
thoughts, and having met no one  when  a  joyous  voice  broke  the  silence
calling my name. What the heck? Who should it be but  Erin  Reading.  I  had
heard she had taken a job in the Olympic National Park during the summer  as
a ranger but what are the odds that I would meet  her  on  this  trail?  She
knew I was on the trail as she had previously run into Jim  and  Eileen.  We
had a nice long chat. She was starting a several day patrol to Lake  of  the
Angels and on to Upper Lena Lake.  Her  pack  was  enormous.  She  mentioned
casually she was carrying a gallon of gas for the ranger cache at  the  Lake
(I didn\'t know they had one there) and was looking and hoping  for  logs  to
saw. Oh the enthusiasm of the young. She was also going to climb  Stone.  It
would have been great if she  had  been  one  day  earlier.  We  could  have
climbed together.

Trip out: 2:i5 hrs including chatting with Erin.

Total for trip: 13.5 miles and 7200 ft in 2 days

Challenger Quad -July 22-25, 2010

Jim and I hatched this last minute trip the  weekend  before  on  Mt  Stone.
Despite attempts at recruiting several others to join us, we had  no  takers
with only three days notice.  So it ended up just the two of us,  which  was
fine with me. I couldn\'t have had a better partner than Jim.

Thursday, July 22: To High Camp - The trip did not start well. With what  we
thought was a bomber forecast and not a mention of  precipitation  anywhere,
we were shocked when it started to drizzle just as we pulled packs from  the
car at the Goodall Cr TH. This can\'t last, we  reasoned.  Just  some  marine
air. Surely it will get better. It didn\'t. It only got worse. It  went  from
drizzle to light rain and soon  everything  including  the  plentiful  brush
(and us) was dripping wet.

The Goodall  Cr  trail  was  in  good  condition,  in  fact  better  than  I
remembered it from last year. At the end of the  old  road  where  the  main
"trail" turns off to Terror Basin (4 miles, 1200  ft,  2:15  hrs),  we  went
straight ahead on a faint path that was hard to  follow.  It  traversed  up,
dropped to cross a ravine, climbed steeply and then went up and down to  the
crossing of Terror Creek at 2000 ft. This short section took  an  additional
1.5 hrs of rough travel. The normal log was under  water  and  not  useable.
There were several alternative ones in the  vicinity.  We  chose  the  least
intimidating one about 10 minutes upstream.

The way trail up to The Barrier ridge  starts  right  from  the  normal  log
crossing. It is fairly easy to follow but very steep as it winds its way  up
through heavy brush and cliffs 1600 ft to the crest at 3600  ft.  This  took
another 2 hours. Once on the crest we thought  things  would  improve.  They
didn\'t. The trail mostly disappeared into thick brush only reappearing  here
and there and we were confronted with several very steep  very  slick  steps
and it seemed to take forever to make any forward progress. By now  we  were
both so wet we couldn\'t possibly get any wetter. Hitting snow at about  5200
ft added to the chill. After 3 more  hours  of  misery  (after  hitting  the
ridge) we broke out into open terrain but had no  visibility  in  thick  fog
and, running out of time (it was 8:15) and getting desperate for a place  to
camp, found a marginal site in the heather at  6000  ft  that  under  better
conditions would have been  less  than  ideal.  Under  these  conditions  it
looked pretty darn good. We most definitely did not want to camp on snow.  I
immediately took refuge in my bivy eating a cold sandwich  for  dinner.  For
me a hot water bottle to warm my chilled feet had a higher priority  than  a
warm meal.  Jim, on the other hand, braved the elements to  sit  around  the
stove eating and drinking and hoping for a better  day  tomorrow.  This  was
the low point of the trip. If things did not improve the next day,  we  were
screwed.

Total: 7 miles, 5700 ft and 9:40 hrs

Friday, July 23: Mt Degenhardt - We awoke to blue skies and sunshine.  Glory
be! We were saved. We spent the next several hours reorganizing and  hanging
wet clothes to dry before starting for Degenhardt at 8:45. We discovered  we
were camped on the edge of  The  Barrier  literally  a  few  feet  from  the
precipice with a grand view into Terror Basin.  As we climbed  to  the  6400
ft col between The Stump and The Barrier we  realized  that  our  choice  of
camp was not that bad and one of the  few  bare  spot  around  with  running
water close by. The col itself had several bivy sites but I didn\'t  see  any
obvious source of water.  From the col we could  look  into  Crescent  Creek
Basin and the heart of the Southern Pickets. All was  snow-covered  and  the
approach to both Terror and Degenhardt looked to be relatively simple.

We descended about 300 ft and traversed  beneath  The  Barrier  until  below
Degenhardt where we took a direct but quite steep line straight  up  to  the
notch just left of the summit horn on the north ridge. It  was  snow  almost
the whole way with only the last little bit  being  loose  rubble.  Here  we
roped up for a very enjoyable short pitch on  excellent  rock  to  a  rappel
sling. An easy but exposed ledge on the east led to  the  final  section  on
the south side and the summit (2700 ft, 5:30 hrs). We spent over a  glorious
hour on top before heading down  at  3:20.  Down  climbing  and  one  single
rappel got us off the rock. Not wanting to descend the  steep  snow  of  our
ascent route we traversed to the notch just below the East Ridge  of  Terror
where an easier gully put us back on the traverse to the  col.  We  returned
to camp at 7:00 where all our hung clothing had dried  nicely  and  spent  a
much more comfortable evening than the previous one. Degenhardt  turned  out
to be an unexpectedly pleasant and leisurely  paced  climb  for  us,  highly
recommended when the rubble is covered with snow.

Total: 4.5 miles, 3100 ft and 10:15 hrs.

Saturday, July 24: Mt Terror - We got a somewhat earlier  start  for  Terror
at 7:15 again starting in crampons. It was a repeat climb  to  the  col  and
down the other side to traverse this time to the base of the Terror  couloir
at 9:30 where we roped up. The couloir was continuous  firm  snow,  slightly
icy in places. About halfway up it constricted to less  than  10  feet  wide
with nasty deep moats on either  side.  Here  Jim  placed  our  one  picket,
although we continued to climb  simultaneously.  We  reached  the  notch  at
10:50.

At this point I kind of lost track of time as the  problem  of  gaining  the
rock became apparent. We could see the rappel anchor one pitch above us  but
had trouble figuring out how to get to it.  We  could  not  cross  the  moat
directly to the best rock. We spent at least an hour  trying  varying  other
options. First we found an entrance into the base of the moat  that  put  us
20 feet or so directly below the step across the moat,  but  the  rock  here
was unprotectable. Jim tried several other places nearby  with  no  success.
We were both getting discouraged and could feel Terror slipping away.  As  a
last resort Jim went farther to the right up a steep but  protectable  crack
and made it work. We were jubilant when we  reached  the  rappel  anchor.  A
second low class 5 pitch gave way to several hundred feet of blessedly  easy
class 2 scrambling which we almost ran up in a rush of impending success.

As we crossed below the false summit to the gully leading to the notch  with
the main summit, we were absolutely shocked  to  hear  another  human  voice
calling to us and saw a lone climber just  entering  the  gully  behind  us.
Where the heck did he come from? Incredibly Randy had come up that day  from
a camp at the ice lake in  Terror  Basin,  crossed  the  Barrier  high  near
Degenhardt, climbed the couloir without  crampons  and  scrambled  the  rock
above the notch unroped. He certainly put us to shame. We all  continued  on
the good rock of the final class 3-4 section to the summit arriving at  2:45
(2500 ft, 7:30 hrs). Randy was an unassuming guy who  seemed  to  think  his
solo feat was no big deal but he was as thrilled to be on the top of  Terror
as we were. He graciously took multiple summit photos  of  Jim  and  me.  We
stayed for most of an hour with Randy taking off before  us.  We  never  saw
him again.

We downclimbed to the class 5 section where 2 single rope rappels got us  to
the notch. We then carefully cramponed down the couloir, leaving the  picket
at the scary constriction for a belay. All the way we saw the heel  plunging
steps of Randy\'s descent. It was absolutely unbelievable to me that  he  was
able to do this. He was either incredibly bold  and  talented  or  had  zero
fear. Probably all three. As for Jim and me we breathed  a  sigh  of  relief
when we reached the bottom of the couloir. Two more  hours,  fueled  by  the
glow of success, put us  back  at  camp  at  8:10  where  we  celebrated  in
contentment until after dark.

Total: 4.5 miles, 2900 ft and 12:45 hrs

Sunday, July 25: Trip out - Neither Jim nor I were looking forward  to  this
day and I would have to say it was pretty much as bad as expected.  Although
all was dry, this was a very hot day and we suffered in the heat even  going
downhill and couldn\'t seem to drink enough. It was difficult to stay on  the
climber\'s trail and we kept  losing  it  in  the  brush.  We  did  find  the
critical start of the trail off the ridge which I had marked  with  my  GPS,
but it seemed even steeper on the descent than it had on the ascent  and  by
the time I reached Terror Cr my knees (and other body parts) were  beginning
to complain. We again had trouble sticking to the path past the crossing  to
the Goodall Cr Trail, which seemed like a virtual highway in comparison.  At
this point Jim went on ahead with my blessing to lessen the duration of  the
pain and I limped in somewhat after him to the TH at 3:50 (7 miles,  400  ft
and 8 hrs).  We salved our various aches with burgers at Good Food and  milk
shakes at Cascadian Farm.

Total for the Trip: 23 miles and 12,100 ft in 4 days

Cloudcomb Pk (8085 ft - P445) and Squaretop Mtn (8189 ft - P309)  -  Pyramid
Mtn Quad - August 6-8, 2010

With a good forecast for Friday but  a  dismal  one  for  the  weekend  most
areas, I had to scramble at the last minute to find a suitable objective.  I
wanted to go to the Entiat where  the  forecast  was  good  to  about  2  pm
Saturday, but Hwy 97A was closed between  Wenatchee  and  Entiat  due  to  a
mudslide from recent thundershower activity.  Upon  hearing  Friday  morning
it had reopened, that is where I headed.

Friday, August 6: Pugh Ridge - From the North Fork Entiat TH at 3900  ft,  I
elected to approach  via  the  scenic  Pugh  Ridge  Trail,  even  though  it
entailed extra elevation gain over going up South Pyramid Creek. I  was  not
disappointed with my choice as once on this  lovely  ridge  the  views  were
marvelous. I dropped off the ridge into  the  headwaters  of  South  Pyramid
Creek, passed luxurious Buck Camp on trail and headed cross-country  to  the
basin south of Pt 7378 where  I  had  my  choice  of  dozens  of  delightful
campsites. A crystal clear  creek  meandered  nearby  through  lovely  green
meadows.

Total: 8.5 miles, 3500 ft, 6 hrs

Saturday, August 7: Cloudcomb Pk - I got an early start at  6:30  hoping  to
beat the coming rain. Things didn\'t go exactly as planned. I  headed  toward
the ridge between Squaretop and (north of) Pt 8000, but when  it  came  into
view I saw cliffs would make access difficult so I did an abrupt right  turn
to the ridge between (south of) Pt 8000 and Pyramid. Up to now  I  had  been
questioning lugging crampons and ice  axe  along  as  I  had  seen  no  snow
anywhere on my route. However, my decision was justified  as  I  topped  the
7920 ft col and saw continuous snow plunging down for  a  thousand  feet.  I
also got my first view of Cloudcomb. My first thought was my that is a  long
ways off and I would have to descend a long ways. My second thought was  how
in the heck was I going to get up this  thing.  It  was  all  pinnacles  and
cliffs and gullies. I studied the view and came up with a plan. I could  see
a ramp that traversed between cliff bands and would get me to a major  gully
that led to a notch south of the summit ridge. I knew I didn\'t  want  to  go
all the way to that notch. I  had  to  reach  another  notch  farther  north
adjacent to the summit pinnacle. I couldn\'t  see  an  obvious  way  to  this
notch, but hoped I could traverse out of the gully just below the ridge.

I cramponed down to the end of continuous snow,  stashed  crampons  and  axe
and traversed talus to the ramp I had seen.  This  led  below  cliffs  to  a
minor notch.  I  descended  a  short  ways  on  the  other  side,  traversed
(generally at 6800 ft) just below  cliffs  to  a  creek  gully,  crossed  to
another minor notch and entered the major gully I had seen from  afar.  This
gully varied from enjoyable  class  3  -3+  to  unpleasant  loose  class  2.
Wherever it had a steep step the rock was solid with good holds.  I  climbed
upward always intending to eventually veer right but I saw  no  obvious  way
out of the gully and terrain led me all the way to the south notch.  I  knew
I didn\'t want to be here and knew where I wanted to go but I  just  couldn\'t
get there.

I reached the notch (notch 1) at 10:45 (2500 ft, 4:15 hrs).  This  is  where
things fell apart. I was over .1 mile from the summit with  a  jagged  ridge
of pinnacles between me and it and no obvious way  to  get  there.  I  first
crossed to the west side and tried various routes but there  were  too  many
nasty gullies and ribs to cross. I did make it the ridge at a  higher  notch
(notch 2) but the ridge looked impossible. I retreated to notch 1 and  tried
a gully on the east side. It steepened to class 4 and I spied a  rap  sling.
Hope surged that I was on route. I  continued  to  the  ridge  where  things
looked vaguely familiar. I was back at notch 2.  I  had  wasted  2  hrs  and
gained nothing. The sling was not on route. It  was  placed  by  someone  as
confused as I was.

Whereas previously I had dismissed a ridge route I now looked  at  it  again
with different eyes. I was running out  of  options  and  time  and  getting
desperate. Adding to my worries the weather  was  beginning  to  deteriorate
and I was racing  the  coming  rain.  I  worked  my  way  along  the  ridge,
bypassing several pinnacles. The holds were good, mostly class 3 with a  few
class 4 moves but quite exposed and I will  admit  I  was  at  or  a  little
beyond my comfort level. And the uncertainty  of  my  route  with  the  real
possibility of getting stuck made me nervous. Eventually I came  to  a  deep
notch (notch 3) where I could see one  more  pinnacle  between  me  and  the
summit. I rappelled into the notch and again down  a  gully  until  I  could
traverse to the final notch (notch 4) below the summit tower. I  crossed  to
the west, circled around to a  minor  west  notch,  crossed  and  climbed  a
chimney to the summit just as it began to rain lightly (3200 ft, 7:15  hrs).
It was 1:45. I snapped a few foggy  pictures  and  left  a  register  before
quickly retreating.

My worry now was how to get off this thing. I was  able  to  down  climb  to
notch 4 as the rock was not yet  terribly  wet  or  slippery.  I  could  not
return along the ridge so continued down the gully from the  notch.  It  was
quite steep in places but again I was able to down climb. I traversed  right
as soon as I could once below cliffs of the summit pinnacles and  darned  if
a reasonable route didn\'t appear back my ascent gully. This  is  the  way  I
should have come up. It would have  saved  hours  but  I  did  not  see  the
correct line from below. It was now clear sailing  down  the  gully,  across
the traverse to the ramp, across the talus and up to the col. It rained  the
whole way but only lightly and since there was no brush, it was not bad  and
I did not get very wet although I did have  to  move  carefully.  I  reached
camp and my dry spacious tent at 7:30 (5 miles, 4900 ft, 13 hrs). It  rained
for several more hours.

Sunday, August 8: Squaretop Mtn - The rain had quit and there  were  patches
of blue so at 8:00 I was  off  to  climb  Squaretop.  After  yesterday  this
turned out to be a very pleasant little scramble in  comparison.  Just  easy
meandering  through  larch  meadows  and  up  heather  and  scree.  My  only
disappointment was that I had no good view of  Cloudcomb  from  the  summit.
Clouds and fog kept wafting up from Lake  Chelan  emphasizing  the  peak  is
aptly named. I stayed on top for well over an hour hoping for  clearing.  It
never came. On the way down I went over the  inviting  gentle  ridge  of  Pt
7378 (2 miles, 1600 ft, 3:40 hr RT).

I hiked out via South Pyramid Creek. This trail crosses South Pyramid  Creek
four times. The third crossing I had to wade.  I  was  also  surprised  this
trail had not been logged out yet whereas the  North  Fork  and  Pugh  Ridge
Trails had (7.5 miles, 200 ft, 4:15 hrs).

Total: 23 miles and 10, 200 ft in 3 days

In 1998 I did the Skyline trail in 4 days  climbing  Zindorf,  Kimta,  Noyes
and Seattle on the way. I had run out of  time  for  Meany  and  had  always
wanted to return for it. Mt Christie was also on my wish list, so when  Paul
suggested this trip with Meany and Christie as the main  objectives,  I  was
all for it. Six days with just Paul and me! Now that would be an  adventure.
It actually worked out very well. I enjoyed Paul\'s company  and  his  humor.
He kept me entertained the whole time. I also appreciated his  attention  to
detail,  his  excellent  route  finding  skills  and  the   fact   that   he
accommodated my desire for a somewhat leisurely trip. I  am  sure  he  could
have done the whole thing faster and in less time  alone.  The  weather  was
sunny and very hot the whole time, until the last day.

Friday, August 13: Twelve Mile Camp -The first day we hiked the  North  Fork
Quinault River Trail to a very pleasant camp  on  the  river  at  Twelvemile
(11.4 miles, 2300 ft, 6:30 hrs).

Saturday, August 14: Low  Divide  and  Mt  Christie  -  The  second  day  we
continued up the North Fork Trail to a camp at Low Divide (4.6  miles,  1800
ft, 3:15 hrs) where we spent the next three nights. The  river  crossing  at
Sixteenmile Camp (inexplicably .7 miles from Twelvemile  Camp)  was  running
high and fast but fortunately a convenient large log was a few hundred  feet
upstream and fording was not necessary.

We arrived at Low Divide early enough  to  go  for  Mt  Christie.  From  Low
Divide we followed the rough Martins Lakes Trail  to  the  lower  basin  and
climbed a wide talus/snow gully to a 5560 ft notch on  the  ridge.  Here  we
had our first view of Christie. It is a very attractive mountain and  I  was
pleased to see the glacier was in good condition. From the notch we  dropped
about 150 feet (some looseness) to get onto the glacier. We donned  crampons
(probably not strictly needed) to get past an icy patch  and  climbed  to  a
6000 ft col on the East Ridge. Except for an annoying  patch  of  krummholz,
the ridge to the summit was easy and we were on top  at  4:30  (3000  ft,  4
hrs). Views were good except to the  SE  where  smoke  from  a  forest  fire
obscured the sky. I left a register. We would have  stayed  longer  but  for
the voracious mosquitoes. They chased us all the  way  back  to  camp  where
they were replaced by biting flies (6.5 miles, 3500 ft, 7 hrs RT).

Sunday, August 15: Mt Noyes and Mt Meany - We started for Meany at  7:30  by
taking the Skyline Trail about 3.5 miles to the high point at a creek. A  way
trail then led up and down on a traverse across meadows, talus and  snow  to
the 5480 ft notch in the ridge between Cougar Mtn  and  Mt  Noyes  (3  hrs).
From here, if only after Meany, it would be best to drop  300  feet  on  the
other side and climb back up  to  the  ridge  beyond  Noyes.  However,  Paul
wanted to also climb Noyes. I had already done this peak but was willing  to
repeat it.

Impenetrable krummholz right at the notch forced us onto the north slope  on
extremely loose unpleasant rock. Oddly I had no recollection  of  this  from
my previous ascent. Paul was very vocal as to his dislike of  this  section.
In fact he generally disliked Noyes so much he barely  stopped  long  enough
to acknowledge reaching the summit (4:40 hrs) before continuing on down  the
North Ridge toward Meany. This ridge proved just as  bad  with  some  tricky
moves and exposure thrown in for  good  measure.  We  lost  a  lot  of  time
climbing over Noyes.

Once at the low point in the ridge things improved and I began enjoying  the
scrambling. From a snow col to the right of the summit block we scrambled  a
short section along the ridge to the final steep section. We  roped  up  and
belayed this single pitch but the holds were good and it was  not  difficult
(maybe class 5.0). The solid rock of this pitch was  in  sharp  contrast  to
the loose shattered shale we had been encountering all  day.  Another  short
scramble above (again loose rock) and we were on the summit  at  3:00  (3850
ft, 7:30 hrs) where swarms of obnoxious flying insects made it difficult  to
take photos. There was a pill bottle register (in good shape)  with  only  2
entries since 1998 (one of which was Mike Torok\'s party) but  there  was  no
pencil so most likely there were more unrecorded ascents. In  order  to  fit
in my pencil I had to leave one of my registers.

We did one rappel and downclimbed everything else to the col.  Then  it  was
easy to the low point of the ridge where Paul had noticed a nice route  down
a rib (to get below steep snow) and into a gully  (some  looseness  but  not
too bad) until we were low enough to traverse below Noyes and climb back  up
to the Cougar-Noyes notch on snow.  This  way  was  infinitely  better  than
going over Noyes (1:15 hr from Meany col). It took an hour  from  the  notch
to the Skyline Trail and another 1.5 hours to reach a creek near  Low  Divide
where Paul had stashed a very much anticipated beer. I refreshed  myself  by
washing in the cold water. We pulled into camp at 8:00 (12  miles,  4700  ft
and 12:30 hrs).

Monday, August 16: Pk 5448 and Martins Lakes - We had thought  to  climb  Mt
Delabarre today but when we returned up the Martins Lakes Trail and  climbed
to the saddle between Pk 5448 and Christie, it just looked too far away  and
our ambition dwindled.  After our experience with the  ridge  between  Noyes
and Meany yesterday (this ridge was twice as long) we knew  it  would  be  a
mighty effort. We were tired and it  was  so  darn  hot  we  decided  to  be
satisfied with climbing Pk 5448 after which we meandered  to  Martins  Lakes
and spent over an hour cooling off in the water.  We  returned  to  camp  at
4:00 for a very leisurely day (7 miles, 2300 ft, 7:30 hrs).

Tuesday, August 17: Halfway House - Paul still had Mt Seattle  to  fit  into
his itinerary, so while I slept in and lounged around camp, he got up  early
and climbed the peak directly from Low Divide in 3.5 hrs RT. He  reported  it
as a nice route with no difficulties other than some  brush  at  the  start.
After his return, we packed up and left at noon making it to  Halfway  House
for the night (10.9 miles, 600 ft, 6 hrs)

Wednesday, August 18 - We hiked the remaining 5.1 miles to the  TH  arriving
at 10:00 (5.1 miles, 400 ft, 2:15 hrs.) after which  we  feed  our  famished
bodies hamburgers in Amanda Park and  further  entertained  ourselves  on  3
nearby little bumps. One (Higley Pk) had an  absolutely  delightful  Â½  mile
trail through lovely woods to the top. We still got home  at  a  respectable
hour.

Total for the Trip: 57.5 miles and 15,600 ft in 6 days

A note on bear wires: Low Divide has bear wires provided  but  the  resident
rodent population seems to have become proficient  in  climbing  the  wires.
The rodents are as much of a problem as the bears. They were  able  to  chew
into our stuff sacks each night to get to the food. If going to this area  I
recommend rodent proof (Kevlar) bags to hang food in.

Mt Despair (7292 ft - P1852 - Damnation Pk Quad) - August 23-25, 2010

Unfinished business. I hate unfinished business and that is what Mt  Despair
was to me. I had failed miserably 3 weeks ago (July 30-August 1)  due  to  a
combination of unexpected bad weather  and  lousy  route  finding.  The  bad
weather was a deal breaker but even without that I doubt I could  have  made
it. I got hung up on cliffs descending into Triumph Cr valley  and  I  would
have run out of time in any event. I made it  to  Triumph  Pass  before  the
rain hit and it became clear I had to turn around. The return to my camp  on
Thornton Ridge in the rain and through impenetrable steep wet brush was  one
of the most miserable climbing experiences I have ever had (rivaled only  by
the wet approach to Mt Terror the week before). I vowed to return only  with
a foolproof forecast. I really didn\'t think I would get  to  it  this  year.
But when a 3 day stellar window appeared I  found  myself  trudging  up  the
Thornton Lakes trail once again.

This time my game plan changed. I do occasionally learn  from  my  mistakes.
Triumph Pass is the logical bivy site for a climb of Despair  but  I  really
didn\'t think I could carry a full  pack  over  the  rugged  terrain  to  get
there. I have trouble with heavy packs on difficult  moves.  Neither  did  I
think I could make it to Despair in one day from a camp  on  Thornton  Ridge
where I had camped before. I had Jim Brisbine\'s TR from 2006  when  he  took
18 hours to do just this. And I am slower than he is. My  new  plan  was  to
bivy as far as I could go before the horrible  steep  drop  to  Triumph  Cr.
This would save me several hours on summit day and most importantly put  off
the 1000 ft climb back to Thornton Ridge until the next day.

Monday, August 23 - From lower  Thornton  Lake,  I  followed  the  climber\'s
trail up onto the lovely open broad east spur leading to Thornton Ridge  and
along the main ridge, up and down, to the saddle at 6120  ft.  From  here  I
descended on the other side, steeply  at  first,  and  traversed  below  the
cliffs of Thornton Peak. This being my 4th time here (2 for  Triumph  and  2
for Despair) I pretty much have the route dialed. I have found  it  best  to
stay high just below the cliffs or snow remnants to avoid steep heather  and
brush as much as possible and to cross a very annoying loose erosion  gully.
This traverse is tedious, slow and unpleasant when snow is gone.  Once  past
the loose gully I began looking for a bivy  site  but  had  trouble  finding
anything remotely suitable. It  was  all  steep  slopes  and  talus.  I  was
beginning to think I would end up sleeping sitting sandwiched between  rocks
when I spied a reasonably flat boulder that would do nicely.  It  had  a  10
foot drop off the end so I tied my bivy to shrubs  to  prevent  falling  off
during the night but other than that it was really quite comfortable. I  had
a great view and there was even a small creek for water nearby  (8.5  miles,
4800 ft, 8 hrs).

Tuesday, August 24 - I left my bivy at 6:45  and  plunged  downhill  at  the
bottom of the last talus field. I did not  cross  the  creek  of  the  usual
route. I was funneled into a watercourse slot that gave a  way  through  the
brush. This was how I went on my failed attempt and it was reasonable  going
until I hit a final cliff at 4500 ft. Previously I  had  exited  to  skier\'s
right to get into the creek gully and  this  is  where  I  got  hung  up  on
waterfalls and cliffs. This time I exited to the left.  It  was  very  steep
forest and brush but I had branches to hang onto as I lowered myself  and  I
was at the bottom at 7:50. I traversed at 4300 ft at the base of  the  cliff
and past the waterfall creek of my previous drama. All in all not too bad  a
way to go. I had to drop farther than the regular route but once down I  was
on easy terrain the rest of the way  to  Triumph  Pass  (5480  ft)  which  I
reached at 9:10. My oh my but Despair still looked a long way away from  the
Pass.

I donned crampons for the snow descent to the 4800 ft lake where I  followed
fresh bear tracks around the shore to the moraine at the  far  end.  Here  I
climbed alongside a deep gully until I could cross at about 5300 ft. I  then
began a long  mostly  level  traverse  through  lovely  terrain  of  heather
benches, talus and numerous creek gullies. I really enjoyed  this  traverse.
I then dropped a bit to a sparkling tarn  at  5100  ft.  I  couldn\'t  resist
taking a 20 minute break to soak my feet. I  left  the  tarn  at  11:55  and
climbed up a heather slope, talus  and  some  snow  to  the  cliff  band  on
Despair\'s SE face at 6600 ft reaching it at 1:15.  I  spied  a  weakness  in
this band on the far left and traversed to  steep  heather.  I  was  feeling
really good and thought I would soon be on top  but  this  scramble  section
took longer than anticipated. It was not difficult but it  was  quite  steep
and I moved with care as I zigged and  zagged  on  ledges  across  the  face
avoiding remnant snow and seeking out the easiest route. At the base of  the
summit block I scrambled up the only  way  that  seemed  possible,  a  short
class 4 dihedral. When I came to the top at the summit  ridge  and  found  a
rappel sling I knew I was on route. An easier scramble  on  the  other  side
led to the summit at 2:30 (4750 ft, 7:45 hrs).

An historic Trailblazer register in a waterproof case was placed  9/5/65  by
Cliff Lawson but he had included every known previous ascent  starting  with
the first in 1939. The staples had rusted out so the pages  were  all  loose
but otherwise they were in good condition. They were also out  of  order  so
while I perused them I put them back in order. I saw many familiar names.  I
found Jim Brisbine\'s entry for 7/28/06. Mine was the 6th  entry  after  his.
Despair seems to be climbed  on  average  once  or  twice  a  year.  Despite
getting concerned about the time I stayed  40  minutes  on  top.  It  was  a
gorgeous day with views to match.

I figured it would take almost as long to  return  as  it  had  to  come.  I
wasn\'t far off the mark. I rappelled the dihedral and downclimbed  all  else
reaching the tarn at 5:00, the lake at 6:25, Triumph Pass at  7:00  and  the
base of my cliff at 8:15. I pulled myself up on branches  through  200  feet
of cliffy woods on climber\'s right and entered my drainage slot just  as  it
got dark. The rest of the way was by headlamp. It  is  funny  how  different
things can look in the dark. There were times I swore I  was  in  the  wrong
place and had lost my way. I wasn\'t and I hadn\'t but it sure  seemed  harder
than in the daylight and slower too. But I eventually emerged from  my  slot
onto the talus where marking my camp with my GPS paid off in spades (I  will
never again not do that). I reached my bivy at 9:45 (8 miles,  6000  ft  and
15 hrs).

Wednesday, August 25 - I left at 9:40 taking 2 hours to climb to the  ridge,
and another 2.5 hours to reach Thornton Lake. No one was  around  so  I  was
able to strip to cool off on this very hot day. A final  climb  out  of  the
lake and the rest was all downhill. As I hiked out  I  was  cheered  by  the
thought that I would never again have  to  do  that  horrible  traverse  and
descent into Triumph Cr valley (8.5 miles, 2000 ft, 7:30 hrs)

Total: 25 miles and 12,750 ft in 3 days

(8069 ft - P709) - Silver Star Mtn Quad - September 9-12, 2010

I knew Roy McMurtrey had climbed Silver Moon from Cedar  Creek  and  he  and
Don Duncan had climbed Wolf Head from Wolf Creek  earlier  this  summer  but
details were lacking. I knew nothing at all  about  Shelokum.  I  wanted  to
climb all three from Cedar Creek. I wasn\'t sure I could do it but I  had  to
try. I really  enjoy  puzzling  out  routes  on  my  own  with  very  little
information and an uncertain outcome. It makes success all the sweeter.

Thursday, September 9: Camp on W Fork Cedar Cr - The  weather  was  forecast
cool with showers through the period but it looked reasonable to me east  of
Washington Pass. When I arrived at the Cedar Creek TH it  was  partly  sunny
and warm. The trail was very good and well used to popular Cedar Falls  (1.7
miles), still good but less travelled thereafter with occasional brush  that
would only really be noticed if wet.  At 4700 ft I  found  a  nice  campsite
just before the trail crosses the West Fork. The sun had now  given  way  to
light sprinkles but I was able to set up my tent before things got too  wet.
It rained lightly the rest of the evening and night  (6.5  miles,  2000  ft,
4:20 hrs).

Friday, September 10: Wolf Head and Shelokum Mtn  -  It  was  still  raining
lightly when I awoke. I procrastinated, decided to start out anyway  and  by
the time I was ready to leave at 8:00 it magically stopped and the sun  soon
came out. I continued on the Cedar  Creek  trail  intending  to  follow  the
South Fork to the basin below Wolf Head once  the  trail  crossed  the  main
Cedar Creek. I ended up staying with the trail all the way to 5800 ft  as  I
saw nowhere appealing to leave it. At that point I had to  leave  it  as  it
headed up a break in cliffs to Abernathy Pass. I spent the next hour  and  a
half traversing above the South Fork through very unpleasant and  still  wet
brush until I emerged onto open terrain.  Here I was dismayed  by  my  first
view of Wolf Head. It presented as continuous slabby cliff with  no  obvious
easy scramble route. This was going to take some time to puzzle out  a  way.
I wasn\'t even sure I would be able to climb it from this side.

I made better progress on talus and through larch groves, crossed the  South
Fork and climbed a short headwall to a talus/scree slope beneath the  cliffs
and above Lamont Lake. I spied a weakness in the  cliffs  on  the  left  and
headed up. It was 12:25 and I was already worried about time. I knew  I  was
too far left but that seemed the only reasonable way to go. I worked my  way
up and when encountering impassible cliffs went  right.  I  always  found  a
scramble route though a few moves verged on class 4. I  reached  the  summit
at 2:40 (3800 ft, 6:40 hrs) where I found Don  and  Roy\'s  record  of  their
ascent in a plastic bag. I removed the paper and added it to the register  I
left.

I spent a pleasant 35 minutes eating lunch, basking in the  sun  and  trying
to dry out wet feet. Then it was off to Shelokum. Try as  I  might  I  could
come up with no alternative to descending the same way but it wasn\'t as  bad
as I thought it would be and I managed to stay on course. I thought I  would
have to drop all the way to the talus slope but I found  a  slightly  higher
traverse that went just below the 7320 ft saddle before climbing to  the  SE
ridge. I hoped I could climb the ridge all the way to the  summit.  I  could
not. After topping a false summit several pinnacles had to  be  bypassed  on
the left. A final loose gully led to the summit at 6:15  (5150  ft,  10  hrs
and 3 hrs from Wolf Head). I left another register.

From the summit I descended straight down a gully that continued  in  fairly
open forest all the way to the South Fork at 8:00. Once across the  creek  I
encountered the same horrible brush as in the  morning.  The  fact  that  it
wasn\'t wet anymore was offset by it now being  dark.  I  stumbled  onto  the
trail at 9:00 some 200 feet lower than where I had  left  it  and  staggered
into camp at 10:00 (9 miles, 5200 ft, 14 hrs).

Saturday, September 11: Silver Moon - I was still  hoping  to  climb  Silver
Moon and go out today. It  didn\'t  happen.  As  with  the  two  other  peaks
everything was harder and took longer than  expected.  Leaving  at  7:40,  I
traversed from camp heading for the NW Fork, crossed the creek   and  picked
up the way trail mentioned by Roy on the other  (N)side.  This  is  quite  a
good way trail though its beginning is a bit  obscure.  There  are  numerous
possibilities to camp in the NW Fork basin above 5800 ft.  I  think  I  made
the same mistake as Roy in getting too  high  too  soon  after  leaving  the
trail. I knew I needed to be farther  left  but  cliffs  prevented  me  from
getting there. I ended up climbing all the way to the base of  the  pinnacle
on the E ridge and having to make a sketchy  traverse  across  slabs  and  a
gully to get to the summit  gully.  I  had  to  make  one  short  rappel  to
accomplish  this.  Once  in  the  summit   gully   interesting   scrambling,
approaching class 4, on beautiful white slabs led to the false summit and  a
narrow exposed ridge to the true summit (3700 ft, 4:45).  I  confirmed  with
my clinometer that the far W point was higher than the small  pinnacle  with
boulders on top and I left my register there.

Worn out from my previous  strenuous  day  I  had  been  moving  slowly  all
morning. It was now 12:25 and clear to me that I would not have time to  get
out before dark and so made the decision to stay another  night.  With  that
in mind I enjoyed a  leisurely  hour  on  the  summit  enjoying  the  views,
especially gorgeous and rugged Silver Star Mtn. I was  not  looking  forward
to the descent. I had to find another way down as I  could  not  reverse  my
rappel.  I  essentially  went  straight  down  the  summit  gully  on  those
beautiful but treacherous white slabs. I  zigged  and  zagged  my  way  down
avoiding the steeper slabs by going to the sides  where  possible.  Lower  I
was funneled into boulders and finally a brushy water  course.  When  I  hit
the blessedly level and lovely meadows of the basin, I stopped at the  creek
to rest and soak aching feet for 30 minutes. I picked up the way  trail  and
followed it back to the main trail and then to camp at 5:00 (4  miles,  3850
ft, 9:30 hrs).

Sunday, September 12 - I awoke at 3:30 am to the sound of light rain  -  not
unexpected. Since I had gone to sleep at 7:00 the previous night I was  well
rested and so figured I might as well get up. I was packed and ready  to  go
by 4:25. It never really rained hard and I found the hike out on good  trail
half by headlamp, half by breaking daylight pleasant. I reached  the  TH  at
7:35 (6.5 miles, 150 ft, 3:10 hrs). I was able to stop  at  Cascadian  Farms
for my usual milkshake and box of blueberries (most likely the last  of  the
season) and still get home a little after 11:00  to  celebrate  my  birthday
with my family.

Total: 26 miles and 11,200 ft in 3.5 days

The continued unsettled weather had me looking for a mellow trip, mostly  on
trail with easy objectives close by that could be done  even  in  the  rain.
This trip fit the bill and even exceeded my expectations in  both  resulting
conditions and scenic quality.

Wednesday, September 15: Slate Lake - It is only 5 miles to Slate  lake  but
almost all the elevation (some 3600 ft) is gained in the first 3 making  for
one steep trail. The last 2 miles ramble up  and  down  along  a  delightful
ridge and around a spur before dropping slightly to  the  6645  ft  lake.  I
started in warm sunshine and shorts which gradually gave way to cool  clouds
and more clothing and finally drizzle and rain gear by the  time  I  reached
the lake at 6:30. I set up my tent in a nice site  nestled  in  a  grove  of
trees. It was the only one I found. Although it is a good trail, it  appears
to be lightly used. It rained lightly the rest of the night (5  miles,  4150
ft, 4:30 hrs).

Thursday, September 16 - Morning: Midnight Mtn - By  morning  the  rain  had
stopped and clearing begun. I started for Midnight Mtn at 8:30 by  wandering
down the lovely meadows of the  upper  Little  Slate  Cr  basin.  I  had  to
descend to about 6200 ft past cliffs to get  to  Little  Slate  Lake  outlet
creek where I picked up a way trail to that lake.  I  wandered  more  lovely
meadows above this lake until I could turn right and  climb  easily  to  the
summit of Midnight Mtn (1450 ft, 2 hrs). It remained  party  sunny  for  the
return to camp at 12:40 (4.5 miles, 1900 ft, 4 hrs RT).

Afternoon: Abernathy Ridge - I barely stopped at  camp  before  heading  out
again climbing the easy slope above the lake  to  the  saddle  south  of  Pk
7576. I traversed past this peak to the saddle on the NW  and  followed  the
ridge to the high point of Abernathy Ridge (1600 ft, 2 hrs). This is  a  fun
easy ridge  with  interesting  and  varied  terrain.  I  could  see  weather
approaching from the west and made it  to  the  summit  of  Pk  7576  (P376)
before it began to drizzle. I continued  on  to  PK  7195  (P395).  Although
neither of these peaks has 400 feet of  clean  prominence,  both  are  close
enough to catch my attention and  are  attractive  little  summits.  Shortly
after returning to camp, the drizzle turned to light rain (4.5  miles,  2650
ft, 4:30 hrs RT).

Friday, September 17 -  It  rained  moderately  all  night  so  I  was  very
surprised when once again it quit by morning and I had no rain for the  hike
out. However, the brush was wet so I still ended up with wet feet. Still,  I
could get used to this pattern of nightly rain and clearing during the  day.
I reached the TH at 11:30 (5 miles, 550 ft, 3 hrs).

Total: 19 miles and 9250 ft in 3 days

Quad; and Pk 7452 (P412) - McLeod Mtn Quad - September 22-26, 2010

I used Jim and Eileen\'s annual larch trip - a grand loop from  the  Robinson
Cr TH to the Monument Cr TH  -as  an  opportunity  to  climb  the  far  from
anywhere peaks of Many Trails and Trailblazer. Jim\'s main climbing goal  was
Lost Peak. Also joining the party were Kevin W, Kevin  K,  Maria,  Doug  and
Lisa (for the last 3 days). We  all  achieved  our  goals  despite  marginal
weather at times and a few adventures along the way.

Day 1 - Wednesday, September 22: Robinson Cr  TH  to  camp  on  Middle  Fork
Pasayten River - We began the trip in beautiful sunny warm  weather,  hiking
over Robinson Pass and dropping to a camp along  the  Pasayten  at  5000  ft
which we reached right at dusk. It rained lightly during the night.

Day total: 12.5 miles, 3750 ft and 7:45 hrs

Day 2 - Thursday, September 23: To camp east of Shellrock Pass  -  The  rain
stopped long enough to eat breakfast and pack up, then off  and  on  showers
occurred the rest of the day. We had a pleasant rain free  lunch  at  Fred\'s
Lake, more light rain climbing over Rolo Pass and dropping to Eureka Cr  and
 wind with snow flurries over Shellrock Pass. The  high  peaks  were  mostly
obscured by clouds and fog with the occasional tantalizing  view.  Kevin  W,
Kevin K and Doug had forged  ahead  hoping  to  pick  up  Blackcap  but  the
deteriorating weather caused them to give up on that idea. We found camp  at
6800 ft on the other side of Shellrock Pass, again at dusk. A short lull  in
the precipitation allowed us to eat dinner  outside  until  increasing  rain
and snow mixed chased everyone into their tents.

Day total: 11 miles, 4400 ft and 9:20 hrs

Day 3 - Friday, September 24: Trailblazer and Many Trails, camp on  Monument
Cr - We awoke to about an inch of new snow and brief blue  skies.  This  was
to be my summit day and I was encouraged by the seemingly good  weather.  It
was short lived. The party split into three groups.  The  guys  would  do  a
carry over Lost Pk planning to then drop straight down to  the  Monument  Cr
trail and up to a camp at Lake of the  Woods.  The  gals  would  follow  the
trail directly to Lake of the Woods. I was  on  my  own  planning  to  climb
Trailblazer and Many Trails and camp somewhere along Monument Cr,  hopefully
near the crossing by Clint\'s Cabin. I knew I wouldn\'t be able to make it  to
Lake of the Woods.

I took off first leaving my big pack at the Butte Pass  trail  junction  and
continuing on with a light day pack. I followed the trail  over  Butte  Pass
and a short ways down the other side until  I  could  traverse  to  a  small
tarn. From here I picked out my route up a gully and snow  covered  rock  to
the summit of Trailblazer (2000 ft, 3 hrs). I had some views on the  way  up
but the weather turned just as I reached the summit  and  was  so  miserable
with blowing snow that I could barely stay long enough to place a  register.
At that point I  seriously  considered  forgetting  about  Many  Trails  and
retreating. I still had time to make it to Lake of the  Woods  and  join  up
with the rest of the party. But the wind was so bad all I could think  about
was taking shelter from it, which happened to be on the side  of  the  ridge
opposite retreat and when I  spied  what  looked  like  a  reasonable  gully
leading down toward Johnny Lakes that is where I  headed  and  my  fate  was
sealed.

The gully was steep and slick with new wet snow. I soon came  to  a  section
that gave me enough concern that I did 3 short rappels off small trees  with
my 50 foot panic rope. Once past that I was able to find  a  scramble  route
the rest of the way down to Johnny Lakes where the  conditions  turned  more
hospitable. Johnny Lakes are lovely and I found myself wishing I could  stay
longer and camp. From the middle lake I began a long traverse  below  cliffs
and across a large gully until I could head up to the south  ridge  of  Many
Trails. Once on the crest it was an  easy  ridge  walk  to  the  high  point
although it seemed to take forever with numerous false  summits.  I  reached
the summit at 3:30 (3800 ft, 7 hrs).

It was no longer precipitating but the wind was as fierce as ever. I  needed
all my wind shells to block it. I quickly left a register  and  then  I  was
faced with the dilemma of how to retreat. It had taken 7 hours to  get  here
and wouldn\'t be all that much faster on the return.  I  considered  dropping
straight down the west slope to Ptarmigan Cr and picking up the trail  there
thinking it might be faster. But it looked so far  down  (I  would  have  to
drop to 5200 ft before climbing back up to 6900 ft  Butte  Pass)and  I  knew
from my experience with that  trail  while  climbing  Ptarmigan  Pk  several
years ago that is was very slow going with many logs and much  brush.  So  I
ended up just  reversing  my  route,  except  I  took  an  easier  route  up
Trailblazer south of my descent gully. This put me  on  Trailblazer\'s  south
ridge 300 feet below the summit. I was worried  about  finding  a  way  down
through the cliffs on the other side to the tarn but as luck would  have  it
I hit the ridge right at a reasonable gully. It was not pleasant but it  did
go. I was back to my pack at 8:30 needing my headlamp from the tarn on.

I still hoped to get to Clint\'s Cabin before  stopping  for  the  night  but
soon discovered the Monument Cr  Trail  in  this  section  is  difficult  to
impossible to follow in the dark. After losing it a few  times,  I  gave  up
when I found a perfect campsite near the creek at 9:30, elev 5800 ft. I  set
up my tent under clearing skies and by the light of a full moon.

Day Total: 10 miles, 5500 ft and 13 hrs

Day 4 - Saturday, September 25: Pk 7452, camp on Eureka Cr/Lost  River  -  I
awoke to a glorious day with glorious views. I hadn\'t  gotten  as  far  down
Monument Cr the night before as I had wanted so I was concerned I  would  be
late meeting up with the main party. The fact that the  trail  continued  to
be difficult to follow in daylight didn\'t help  the  situation.  I  lost  it
several times but always managed to find it again. I learned later that  the
others had trouble with the trail also. In fact Eileen  and  Maria  lost  it
completely and had their own adventure making  their  way  to  Lake  of  the
Woods. Once past the crossing near Clint\'s Cabin the trail  improved  and  I
had no more trouble with it other than the fact that it  climbed  2500  feet
to Pistol Pass.

Shortly past Pistol Pass I ran into Maria  relaxing  in  the  sun.  Jim  and
Eileen had left the trail at this point to climb Pistol  Peak  and  she  was
waiting for them. I learned that Lisa had made it to Lake of the  Woods  the
day before and she and the other guys  were  all  climbing  Lake  Pk  before
heading out. So I went from being  worried  about  holding  everyone  up  to
being at the head of the pack and even having time to run up  Pk  7452  (900
ft, 1:10 hr RT from trail) before the whole  party  came  together  for  the
masochistic 4000 ft descent to our last camp at the Eureka/Lost  confluence.
Not wanting to break the cycle we again had dinner in the dark, but  it  was
brightened by feelings of success, good company and a cheerful Eileen fire.

Day Total: 14 miles, 3700 ft and 11 hrs

Day 5 - Sunday, September 26: Monument Cr TH - Once again it  rained  during
the night and once again I packed a wet tent. But the short  leisurely  trip
out on good trail was sheer delight and a pleasant way to  end  a  wonderful
loop trip.

Day Total: 4 miles, 400 ft and 1:30 hrs

Total for trip: 51.5 miles and 17,750 ft in 5 days

Big Kangaroo (8280+ ft - P1000) - Silver Star Quad - September 30, 2010

I started from the hairpin curve on Hwy 20 at 10:10  and  followed  the  way
trail to Kangaroo Pass about .6 miles to a clearing where I  could  traverse
to a crossing of Early Winters Creek.  Here I ran across an  extensive  area
of old airplane wreckage.  I  wonder  what  the  story  is  behind  this.  I
encountered moderate (and wet from heavy dew) brush for the next  1000  feet
or so before things began to open up. Eventually I ended  up  in  the  major
gully southwest of the summit. It steepened to a class 3 section  then  laid
back a bit but became very loose and unpleasant.

Approaching the summit rocks I crossed left into another gully topped  by  a
chockstone. Serious scrambling began here. I wiggled under  the  chockstone,
and climbed to the right above it on solid rock to the ridge  north  of  the
summit where there was a rappel  anchor.  I  crossed,  downclimbed  maybe  5
feet, traversed a short distance and climbed back to the ridge at  the  base
of the summit tower. Here I put on rock shoes and  roped  up.  An  easy  but
exposed ledge led to a spacious shelf below the final slab.  It  took  me  a
while to get up the nerve to make  the  unprotected  move  to  a  depression
midface where I was able to get  in  a  cam.  I  couldn\'t  quite  reach  the
slinged bolt on top so instead traversed right to the ridge and finished  au
cheval (5 hrs).

There was no room to stand on top so I  took  my  pictures  and  set  up  my
rappel sitting straddling the crest. I rappelled the  slab  and  downclimbed
the rest to the rap anchor on the  ridge  above  the  chockstone  where  one
rappel got me down to the gully below the chockstone. My  120  ft  rope  was
sufficient. The upper gully descent was very unpleasant with loose  rock.  I
followed a better line with less brush lower down and still  hit  the  creek
crossing right at the plane debris. I reached the car at 6:00.

Total: 3 miles, 3150 ft and 7:50 hrs



Liberty Bell Mtn - Beckey Route (7720+ ft - P200) - Washington Pass  Quad  -
October 1, 2010

I car camped at the Blue Lake TH and  had  it  all  to  myself  until  other
climbers started showing up beginning at 5:30 am. Jim and Eileen made  their
appearance promptly at the appointed hour of 9:00 and we were under  way  by
9:30. We followed the smooth Blue  Lake  Trail  1.6  miles  to  the  cairned
junction of the rough climber\'s trail to the Liberty  Bell  notch  which  we
reached at 11:40. Here we all changed to rock shoes and roped  up.  Although
the day was sunny and generally warm the notch itself was in the  shade  and
quite cold. The sun was just out of reach about halfway up the first  pitch.
I had to put on all the meager clothing I had  brought  along  in  order  to
stay warm while waiting for my turn to climb.

Jim led, followed by Eileen and I was last. The first pitch  traversed  easy
ledges to a rib and up this rib to a  spacious  belay  at  a  tree  below  a
chimney. While Jim was climbing another party of 3 showed up  at  the  notch
but there was never any conflict between our groups. They  were  just  ready
to start by the time I had finished the first pitch.

The second pitch went up a strenuous  (for  me)  chimney  and  a  series  of
cracks to a belay at the base of a moderate slab.

The third pitch went up the slab to a fixed pin below  a  short  wall,  then
went left on a finger tip traverse, right to  a  lieback  crack  on  another
slab and around a corner to another spacious belay at a tree.

The fourth pitch went across a shoulder to  the  base  of  the  white  slab.
Being of short stature I had some trouble  with  this  slab  as  I  couldn\'t
reach the key handhold at the top. I finally just  had  to  go  for  it  and
launch myself upward to reach for it.

Above the slab was a short easy class 4 bit at the top of which we left  the
ropes for the last easy scramble to the roomy summit (6:40 hrs).   The  view
was fantastic and we spent a glorious hour on top. I am not sure any  of  us
really believed we were actually finally on Liberty Bell  and  we  were  all
positively beaming. Success was sweet indeed. It had certainly been  a  long
time coming but well worth the wait.

We downclimbed to our ropes, did one single rappel over the white  slab  and
downclimbed easy slots and ledges to the rappel  bolts  directly  above  the
notch. These bolts (with chains attached) are on a  vertical  wall  above  a
wide but sloping and  very  exposed  ledge.  We  all  took  care  to  anchor
ourselves carefully as we set up the final double rope rappel to the  notch.
Two 50 m ropes just reach. There is also an intermediate  rap  station  half
way down for those with only one rope. We reached the notch at 6:15 and  the
car at 8:00 using headlamps for the last 30 minutes on the trail.

I found the Beckey Route to live up to its reputation. It is  a  challenging
and enjoyable route on solid rock with much  variety.  All  the  belays  are
spacious with room to relax, regroup and access packs without  the  fear  of
losing things. It is very popular for good reason.

Total: 4.5 miles, 2300 ft and 10:30 hrs.

We celebrated with a  gourmet  dinner  in  Mazama  before  crashing  at  the
Klipchuck campground. Jim and Eileen pulled out the next morning at 6:30  to
meet Mike Torok at 7:00 for a climb of Cutthroat. I (having already  climbed
Cutthroat) passed on joining them. I slept in  and  had  a  leisurely  drive
home stopping at the Washington Pass  Overlook  for  a  short  walk  and  at
Colonial Creek Campground for the delightful 4  mile  RT  trail  up  Thunder
Knob.

Quad; and Pk 7665 (P505 - Ashnola Pass Quad) - October 5-7, 2010

Most people climb Sheep Mtn from Canada. It is certainly shorter  that  way.
But I also wanted to climb Two  Point  Mtn  and  to  experience  the  lovely
terrain between Larch  Pass  and  Peeve  Pass.  Gorgeous  doesn\'t  begin  to
describe it this time of year with the larches in full color. It  is  simply
to die for.

Tuesday, October 5: Camp below Larch Pass - I started from  Billy  Goat  TH,
elev 4800 ft, at 11:15. The day was warm in the sun but icy  in  the  shade.
The trail was in excellent shape making for speedy travel except  for  those
previous muddy and now frozen sections  that  had  been  churned  by  recent
horse traffic to a minefield of deep divots. I climbed to  6600  Billy  Goat
Pass, dropped to 5500 ft Drake Creek, climbed to 6000 ft Three  Fools  Pass,
dropped to 5500 ft Diamond Creek and contoured several miles  before  making
the final climb to below Larch Pass. I had  to  backtrack  slightly  when  I
realized Larch Creek had dried up in the meadows below the pass. I  found  a
nice spot to camp at the last running water at 6:15, elev 6600 ft.

Day total:  12 miles, 3700 ft and 7 hrs

Wednesday, October 6: Sheep Mtn, Sand Ridge, Pk 7665 and Two Point Mtn  -  I
awoke in the dark and was ready to  go  at  7:15.  It  froze  overnight  but
warmed quickly during the 40 minutes to 7200 ft Larch  Pass  where  I  broke
out into welcome sunshine. From this point on I  was  in  heaven.  A  mostly
level traverse led to wide open McCall Gulch and 7500 ft  "McCall  Pass".  A
sign here listed Peeve Pass as 4 miles distance and Billy Goat  Pass  as  11
miles. I dropped 500 ft  into  stunning  larch  meadows  above  Timber  Wolf
Creek, climbed to 7300 ft on a  shoulder  of  aptly  named  Sand  Ridge  and
dropped to 6900 ft Peeve Pass. From the pass it was a  gentle  stroll,  with
some minor talus, to the broad summit of Sheep Mtn, which I reached  shortly
before noon (8 miles, 2800 ft, 4:40 hrs).

Sheep Mtn is a twofer. In addition to being on the Top 200 list it also  has
over 2000 feet of prominence. So despite being a gentle summit  it  commands
quite a view of the Pasayten highlands, which I  thoroughly  took  in  while
eating lunch. I improved a bit on the summit  cairn  and  added  a  register
before leaving at 12:25. On the way back I climbed  to  the  high  point  of
Sand Ridge becauseâ¦ well, because I cannot resist ridges. Then I had my  eye
on Pk 7665 across the way. It just looked so inviting  I  had  to  climb  it
also despite still wanting to get up Two Peak Mtn this day. I knew doing  so
it would be close for making the latter before dark.

I returned to Larch Pass at 5:30 where  I  picked  up  the  abandoned  trail
(shown on the USGS map but not GT) that goes  to  Dollar  Watch  Pass.  This
trail soon essentially ended at  a  camp  on  a  bench  so  I  just  climbed
straight uphill to the south ridge of Two Point East. The  main  summit  was
west along a rocky but easy ridge that I ran as fast  as  possible  arriving
on top just as the sun set. A glorious experience but not one  conducive  to
summit photos. Naturally I had to climb both points  of  Two  Point  Mtn  so
went over the east summit on the way down. I made a direct  descent  to  the
trail by headlamp. Despite being camped no more than a hundred  feet  or  so
off the trail I was happy I had marked it with my GPS. Everything  looks  so
different in the dark. I stumbled into camp at 8:05 glad  to  have  used  up
some of the hours of darkness.

Day Total: 19 miles, 5900 ft and 12:50 hrs.

Thursday, October 7 - All I had to do this day was hike out  so  I  took  it
leisurely just enjoying the scenery and  trail  hiking.  I  stopped  to  eat
lunch and soak tired feet at cute Two Bit Creek. I could have  done  without
the 1100 ft climb up to Billy Goat Pass but other than that  it  was  mostly
pleasant and I reached the TH at 3:00. I saw no one else the entire trip.

Day Total: - 12 miles, 1800 ft and 6 hrs

Trip Total: 43 miles and 11,400 ft in 3 days

2010

I was so enchanted by the area I  visited  last  week  I  couldn\'t  wait  to
return. My main goals this time, besides just being in  heaven  once  again,
were Dollar Watch and Ashnola and I really wanted to  visit  Whistler  Basin
which looked so unreal on the map. There were several other  possible  peaks
if I had the time  and  energy,  most  notably  Quartz  Mtn.  This  one  was
doubtful as if anything it was farther away than Sheep. I  accomplished  all
my goals and then some but at a toll on my body.

Tuesday, October 12: Camp below Dollar Watch Pass -  I  again  started  from
the Billy Goat TH hiking over Billy Goat Pass and Three Fools  Pass  but  at
8.5 miles took Trail 451 to Dollar Watch Pass instead of the  one  to  Larch
Pass. The day was not as sunny as I had hoped and quite  chilly  but  I  had
plenty of clothes to keep me  warm.  I  had  also  switched  to  my  heavier
sleeping bag. There was a very nice camp at Tony Creek but I wanted  to  get
as far as possible so continued to just below  Dollar  Watch  Pass  where  I
found a scenic flat spot for my tent with water nearby at 5:30.

Day Total: 12 miles, 4100 ft and 7 hrs

Wednesday, October 13: Ashnola Mtn, Pk 7330 and  Quartz  Mtn  -  It  was  28
degrees and cloudy and so again quite chilly  when  I  started  at  7:00.  I
climbed the short distance to Dollar Watch Pass  and  descended  850  ft  to
cross the E Fork Pasayten River. I had hoped to take a higher traverse  into
upper McCall Gulch but XC travel was not appealing  and  it  was  easier  to
stick with the trail until it took a definite turn downhill  and  away  from
where I wanted to go. At this point I did strike out XC until  I  hit  Trail
548 higher up. I stuck with this trail until I hit open  terrain  with  easy
travel to the summit of Ashnola Mtn (5 miles, 1900 ft, 3:15 hrs).  From  the
summit I got the surreal view I was looking for into Whistler Basin.

Next up was Pk 7330 across Whistler Basin. Rather than follow the ridge  all
the way to Whistler Pass and an easy way down I opted for a  direct  descent
down a gully through cliffs, class 3 except for  one  class  4  move  off  a
ledge. Once in the mile wide basin I was in heaven again.  What  a  gorgeous
place! Camping would be superb. And water is no problem. Even this  time  of
year I crossed several small  running  creeks  and  even  marshy  areas.   I
strolled across the flat lower basin heading  for  the  saddle  east  of  Pk
7330, climbed the short steep rocky SE nose and  did  more  strolling  along
the gentle ridge to the high point (7 miles, 2300  ft,  5:15).  I  found  no
signs of a previous ascent so built a cairn for  my  register  while  eating
lunch.

I left Pk 7330 at 12:50 hoping to continue on to Quartz Mtn.  It  looked  an
awfully long ways away and I didn\'t know if I had time to make  it.  It  all
depended on if I could find the dotted trail shown on GT and what  condition
it was in. Well, I ran into it easily a short ways from the  saddle  and  it
was in excellent condition. Usually I  am  cursing  the  trail  builders  in
horse country that consider only horse travel and not foot travel and  think
nothing of adding unnecessary distance and elevation. This  time  I  blessed
the trail builders. The trail was an  almost  perfect  contour  beneath  the
slopes of Sand Ridge, flat and smooth, making for  swift  and  easy  travel.
Without such a trail I doubt I could have made Quartz. The day  had  finally
turned warm and sunny so much so that I  shed  to  shorts.  I  followed  the
trail past the junctions to Peeve  Pass  and  Quartz  Lake  until  below  SE
slopes where another XC stroll led to the summit, an  outcrop  of  rock  for
which the peak is named (12 miles, 3400 ft, 8 hrs).

I took a slightly more direct route down to  the  trail  to  return  beneath
Sand Ridge and across enchanting  upper  Whistler  Basin  to  Whistler  Pass
(16.5 miles, 4400 ft, 10:30  hrs).  A  cool  wind  and  lengthening  shadows
prompted adding warm clothes. I continued on trail to McCall  Pass  where  I
headed uphill to "Pk 7821". Why  climb  this  particular  bump  of  so  many
others on the ridge? Because  for  some  strange  reason  it  is  in  Beckey
despite having only 221 ft prominence and limited climbing appeal. Well,  it
did have a cute cairn and was a nice viewpoint - or it would  be  with  more
light. I reached the top at sunset (17.75 miles, 5000 ft, 11:15 hrs).

I now had to think about how the heck I would get  back  to  camp.  I  could
return on good tread via Trails 548 and 451 but this meant  dropping  to  at
least 6100 ft (more if I stayed entirely on trail) before climbing  to  6960
Dollar Watch Pass. Or I could take Trail 502 to Larch  Pass,  pretty  level,
and pick up the abandoned  trail  going  over  Two  Point  ridge.  This  was
shorter and involved climbing only about 400 feet but I wasn\'t sure I  could
follow this trail. To add to the mix my bad right leg, the one  I  broke  in
1997, was starting to bother me. This is not unusual as it has  bothered  me
off and on for years when I overdo, the result of damage  from  3  surgeries
to add and remove hardware to both the ankle and the knee. Well I would  say
I was certainly "overdoing" and my leg was  letting  me  know.  It  manifest
itself such that I was now beginning to have trouble  lifting  the  leg  and
bending the knee. That made going uphill difficult. So I reasoned  the  less
uphill the better and opted to return over Larch Pass.

At Larch Pass I picked up the abandoned trail by headlamp. My  progress  was
pitifully slow as I could now only step up with  my  left  leg.  But  I  was
pleased I was able to stick with the trail all the way to  Two  Point  ridge
and was even congratulating myself on that fact when I couldn\'t  find  where
it left the ridge and I was hit with a dose of reality. For  the  next  1.5
hours  I  wandered  in  the  wilderness  never  finding  the  trail   again,
descending to Tony Cr and making an unpleasant traverse around Two  Point  S
Ridge. Fortunately it was all downhill and downhill didn\'t bother my leg  as
much. But by the time  I  reached  camp  at  9:30  my  leg  was  essentially
nonfunctional.

Day Total: 22 miles, 5500 ft and 14:15 hrs

Thursday, October 14:  Dollar  Watch  Mtn  and  Pk  7455  (P392)  -  My  leg
recovered enough overnight to take  me  up  Dollar  Watch  Mtn  on  a  sunny
morning. A good trail the whole way. There was a nice  campsite  with  great
views on top but water would have to be carried. I  returned  to  camp  over
Peak 7655 just because it looked inviting and its  prominence  is  close  to
400 (3 miles, 1500 ft, 3 hrs RT).

I left at 11:30, had lunch at Diamond Cr and reached the  car  at  6:00.  My
leg lasted the trip out (12 miles, 1900 ft and 6:30 hrs).  Again  I  saw  no
one the whole time, not even at the TH.

Trip Total: 49 miles and 13,000 ft in 3 days

 Holliway Mtn (8000+ ft - P600 - Washington  Pass  Quad)  -  October  19-21,
2010

Holliway is overshadowed by  loftier  neighbors  on  all  sides  -  Azurite,
Hardy, Golden Horn and Tower  -  and  probably  for  that  reason  is  often
overlooked and seldom climbed. It is also not that easy to  get  to.  Stefan
climbed it two years ago from Tower Cr. Roy approached last  week  by  going
up Swamp Cr to Methow  Pass.  Both  ways  are  shorter  than  my  choice  of
Cutthroat Pass but I didn\'t mind the extra distance and elevation. I  really
like the scenic PCT from Cutthroat Pass to Methow Pass. It is  an  excellent
trail with easy hiking. I saw no one  in  this  usually  popular  area  from
Cutthroat Pass on.

Tuesday, October 19: Camp in Snowy  Basin  -  I  hiked  the  10  miles  over
Cutthroat Pass, down to Granite  Pass  and  on  to  the  beautiful  spacious
campsite in the basin at the Snowy Lakes junction, elev 6200 ft.  The  views
were as spectacular as ever but the larch color was gone  with  most  having
lost all their needles. The day was warm enough for shorts in the sun and  I
had visions of setting up camp  in  the  comfort  of  sunshine  only  to  be
disappointed. In spite of  it  still  being  fairly  early,  the  basin  was
already in the shade when I arrived and you know what that means  this  time
of year - the temperature plummeted.

Day Total: - 10 miles, 2400 ft and 6 hrs.

Wednesday, October 29: Holliway Mtn - I started at 7:00 and was  treated  to
a gorgeous sunrise while hiking the mile to 6600 ft Methow Pass.  The  trail
then dropped 4 miles into perpetual shade to 4600 ft Wills  Camp  on  Golden
Cr. Here I left the trail and went up the left side of the  creek  intending
to go to Nugget Lakes. Easier said than done. I  began  in  reasonable  open
forest but soon found myself traversing  steep  brushy  sidehill  below  the
slabs mentioned by Roy. This was not fun. I gave up on the idea of going  to
the lakes and as soon as I felt I was past the slabs I headed on  an  upward
traverse to a gully that goes directly from  the  lakes  to  the  summit.  I
reached the edge of this gully and the first sunshine of the day  at  11:30.
Now things were looking up. The gully itself  was  slabby  and  loose  so  I
climbed on the rib to the left. Near the top I went  to  the  right  of  the
summit tower up a steepening gully and then left to the summit  cairn  (3900
ft, 6:30 hrs), mostly class 2 with maybe some class 3-3+ depending upon  the
exact route taken. No rope needed.

I dug in the summit cairn and found the original film can register  left  by
Dan Sjolseth and Cliff Lawson on their first ascent of July 3,  1981.  There
were no other names entered. I found this puzzling. I know personally  of  4
parties who have climbed this peak and surely there were others.  Were  none
of them able to find the register? It was  only  under  one  rock.  Then  it
occurred to me that perhaps there was a newer  register  that  everyone  had
signed that has since disappeared. I left the film can in the  same  spot  I
found it for historic reasons while adding my own register  well  buried  in
the center of the cairn.

I spent an hour basking in sunshine and views. I knew I would  soon  descend
into shade and would get back to  camp  well  after  dark.  But  I  was  not
worried. All I had to do was get to the PCT in daylight and I  could  easily
follow that to camp by headlamp. I went down the gully, or on  skiers  left,
directly to the lakes. The whole way was dominated by the sheer  north  wall
of Golden Horn looming ominously above. Slightly before hitting the lakes  I
entered shade. I had only a short distance to get around  the  eastern  lake
but as is often the case with mountains lakes the  shore  was  quite  steep.
And it was frozen and slippery. This was probably the  most  dangerous  part
of the whole climb as I traversed icy turf and  rock  above  deep  water.  I
could have used both crampons and ice axe. Fortunately it was  short  and  I
had brush to hang on to. The surface of both lakes had a thin layer of  ice.
I would venture a guess that this time of year the sun never shines in  this
deep dark hole and the temperature never gets above freezing.

Seeking a better way down I followed Golden Cr, first on the right  to  pass
a frozen slab waterfall, then on the left, then on the right and finally  on
the left again. I still ran into brush but it was better than my  up  route.
My only suggestion in hindsight as to route is to stick fairly close to  the
creek and cross as terrain dictates. I hit  Wills  Camp  and  the  trail  at
5:00. The 2000 ft up to Methow Pass took until  7:30  from  where  I  zipped
down to camp by the light of a full moon at 8:00.

Day Total: 14 miles, 6000 ft and 13 hrs

Thursday, October 21: Golden Horn Revisted and Pt 7140 -  This  was  another
beautiful day so I just couldn\'t leave without visiting Snowy  Lakes  again.
Well one thing led to another and another and another. At the lakes I  still
wasn\'t ready to leave so I decided to head up toward Golden Horn for a  view
of Holliway. Well I had to go almost to the summit  to  get  my  view  so  I
figured I might as well climb it again. Darned if  there  isn\'t  a  10  foot
sling now to hang onto on the final tower. That wasn\'t there when I  climbed
it the first time a few years ago. Sure  makes  it  a  lot  easier.  Anyway,
Golden Horn is a delightful scramble and it is also a fast descent with  all
that plungestepable scree. I was having  so much  fun  and  it  was  all  so
beautiful I prolonged it even more  by  rambling  the  inviting  ridge  from
Upper Snowy Lake to Pt 7140  above  Methow  Pass  before  making  a  beeline
straight down to camp (4 miles, 3000 ft, 5:30 RT).

My little side trip had taken longer than I had intended so I  didn\'t  break
camp until 2:45, which insured I would get to the TH after  dark.  Oh  well,
that is what headlamps are for (10 miles, 1000 ft, 4:20 hrs).

Trip Total: 38 miles and 12,400 ft in 3 days

As an added comment, the leg that shut down on me last trip  did  okay  this
time. I guess I didn\'t reach the threshold distance. Oh sure  it  still  had
twinges, as did other body parts, but  it  was  nothing  serious.  Just  the
usual aches and pains and everything still  functioned  reasonably  well.  I
can live with that.

Sunrise Pk (8144 ft - P1024 - Sweetgrass Butte Quad) - October 27, 2010

Tuesday, October 26: Goat Pk and Sweetgrass Butte - I drove over  Washington
Pass and hiked the trail to Goat Pk (7001 ft -  P1361  -  McLeod  Mtn  Quad)
above Mazama (5 miles, 1500 ft, 2:40 hrs RT).  I had some partial views.

I then drove up Rd 52 to Sweetgrass Butte  (6109  ft  -  P349  -  Sweetgrass
Butte Quad) hoping for a view of Sunrise Pk. No luck with  that  but  I  did
have fun negotiating the 6-8  inches  of  fresh  snow  on  the  steep  road.
Backtracking on Rd 52 I took a spur up the E side of Goat Cr  2.2  miles  to
its end and car camped in the spacious turn around, elev 4600 ft.  There  is
a gate on this road but it was open. It was a cold night but the  heater  in
my car works well. I was very comfortable.

Wednesday, October 27:  Sunrise  Pk  -  I  began  at  first  light  and  was
delighted to discover an unmarked trail traverses above Goat Cr for  over  2
miles. This greatly facilitated travel but I was puzzled as  to  the  reason
for its existence until I came across an old cabin at its  end  (1.5  hrs).
The cabin is no longer usable but the trail is  still  being  maintained  by
someone. At the cabin there were signs  the  trail  crossed  the  creek  and
continued but it was no longer maintained and I soon lost it. For  the  next
2 hours I was slowed by dense forest littered  with  downed  trees  until  I
broke out into the open below the SE Basin of Sunrise at 6400 ft.  Snow  was
about 1 foot deep here. Easy slopes led to  the  South  Ridge.  I  had  some
views and sucker holes held out the hope for improving weather but  once  on
the  broad  open  ridge  things  deteriorated  and  I  encountered  whiteout
conditions and a brutal wind. Needless to say I didn\'t hang  out  very  long
on the summit (6 hrs). I was back to the car at 5:20 where I  spent  another
night. It began snowing lightly as I prepared dinner  but  by  morning  very
little had stuck to the road.

Total: 10 miles, 3700 ft and 10 hrs

Thursday, October 28: Driveway Butte and Pk 5545 - Before returning  home  I
drove to the Klipchuck Campground and hiked  the  trail  to  Driveway  Butte
(5982 ft - P502 - Robinson Mtn Quad). The upper part of the trail had  fresh
snow and was all in fog. I had no views at all. Still, I enjoyed the  hiking
on good trail. On the way down I took the unmarked side  trail  to  Pk  5545
(P505 - Silver Star Quad). A pleasant ridge ramble, but again no views.

Finney Pk (5083 ft - P1643 - Finney Pk Quad) and Finicky Bluff (4120+  ft  -
P400 Gee Point Quad) - November 2010

I have tried 3 times to get up Finney.  I  first  tried  several  years  ago
after climbing Big Gee only to discover Rd 1735 blocked several  miles  from
the peak. I tried again June 26 of this year and found Rd 18 (I  drove  from
Darrington) blocked by a new slide before I could get to  any  access  roads
(it has since been fixed). In an attempt to salvage the day I went  straight
up from Rd 18 toward Harry Lk to the S Ridge. I  ran  into  horrible  brush.
Once on the ridge it was  nice  but  I  was  stopped  at  the  S  Pk  by  an
impassible notch and I did not have the time to find a way around it.

The third time was the charm. I drove up the higher access  road  because  I
also wanted to get Finicky. After about a mile  this  road  gets  rough  and
overgrown. I stopped after 3  miles  of  abusing  my  Jeep  although  it  is
probably possible to drive all the way to the end if you  don\'t  care  about
scratching your vehicle. Brush was horrible and very  wet  from  heavy  rain
the day before along the ridge from the end of the road.  Approach  from  Rd
1735 would be better if all you want is Finney. The ridge led to  cliffs  on
the west face of Finney. I traversed below these to the  notch  with  the  S
peak and went up the S Ridge from there. The  first  part  was  steep  mossy
class 3+ rock. Then it eased back to a  pleasant  ridge  scramble.  About  1
foot of snow was on top. I found a large  summit  register.  It  was  filled
with water but the paper was double wrapped in  plastic  inside  and  stayed
dry. It was placed in 2003. Surprisingly the  only  name  I  recognized  was
Fred Beavon from 8/03. Maybe others climbed it before  03  or  the  register
was under snow.

On the way back I also climbed Finicky Bluff.  Brushy  and  wooded  with  no
view it is a typical dumpster with nothing going for it but a cute name.

Total: 9 miles, 3440 ft and 8 hrs

Klone Pk (6820 ft - P900) and Kelly Mtn (6760+ ft -  P480)  -  Silver  Falls
Quad - November 4-5, 2010

Thursday, November 4 - I drove up the Entiat River Road  past  Silver  Falls
and  took Rd 5605 some 7 miles to its end at the North Tommy  TH  which  was
completely snowfree despite being at 4500 ft. Elk season was still going  on
so I was somewhat surprised to find the parking lot  empty.  I  did  however
meet a pickup coming  down  the  narrow  road.  The  tough  looking  driver,
accompanied by an equally tough looking  dog,  did  not  appear  pleased  at
having to yield space for me to pass and did not return my wave. I was  glad
he was on his way out.

The North Tommy Trail is a designated motorcycle trail and although open  to
multiple use is obviously built mainly for these  machines.  It  is  smooth,
which I like, but it also has an annoyingly low grade and interminable  long
switchbacks that take forever to get anywhere. The first  part  to  Pt  5863
goes through a burn that is nicely reseeding with a thick  green  carpet  of
small pines. I took a pleasant rest in the sun on top of Pt 5863,  which  is
a good viewpoint with a couple of rough wooden seats. It also has a  strange
log platform about 10 feet square. I am not sure what this  was.  There  was
sparse snow to this point but descending the other side and  along  the  now
wooded up and down ridge its depth gradually increased. There were  numerous
footprints which I presumed to  be  mostly  from  previous  hunters.  I  had
planned to camp at a spot labeled "Three Creek Ridge Camp" on the  USGS  map
even hoping for amenities that hunter camps often  provide  such  as  rustic
shelters and furniture but I found no  sign  of  anything  there.  The  camp
either no longer exists or was buried under the now foot  plus  of  snow.  I
did, however, find a nice spot a short ways on under a tree that  was  level
and essentially snowfree.  There was no water though, so  I  would  have  to
melt snow.

Total: 7 miles, 2400 ft and 5 hrs

Friday, November 5: Kelly Mtn and Klone Pk - I had hoped for an early  start
but I slept like a rock and didn\'t awaken until  6:30,  somewhat  surprising
as I had turned in at 7:30 the night before. I have been sleeping  amazingly
well lately in the mountains. Come to think of it that has been  even  since
I switched to the NeoAir air mattress by Thermarest.  It  is  so  shockingly
comfortable it can lead to late starts. Of  course  a  toasty  sleeping  bag
also contributes.

Even so, I got going at 7:30, early enough to see the sunrise.  I  continued
on the trail following the beaten path. The  snow  quickly  got  deeper  and
although the tracks were old I could tell whoever made them had  now  donned
snowshoes. When the track left the trail near the saddle with Klone  Pk  and
headed for Kelly Mtn, it finally dawned on me  that  these  weren\'t  hunters
but peakbaggers like me. The track led all  the  way  to  the  summit.  What
luck! They saved me much postholing in the soft snow  as  I  did  not  bring
snowshoes. Anyone who knows me knows I  dislike  these  clumsy  contraptions
and I gambled I could do without them.

I returned to the saddle and darned if the  track  didn\'t  continue  up  the
trail and on to Klone Pk. These guys had the same plan as I and again I  had
no trailbreaking. Klone is an old lookout site. The  lookout  is  long  gone
but the foundation and the views remain. I still  had  visibility  into  the
heart of the Entiat but the  day  was  clouding  up,  a  sign  of  impending
weather. This is why I wanted an early start - to beat the incoming  weather
out. From the summit I went straight off the NE side taking a shortcut  back
to camp. Snow was quite deep here but it was downhill so no problem.  I  ran
across vestiges of the old abandoned trail that used  to  climb  steeply  up
this side. I reached camp at 11:00.

Total: 3.5 miles, 1500 ft and 3:30 hrs

On the way out I couldn\'t tolerate the long switchbacks anymore and  so  cut
them on snow where possible. This actually saved over a mile  of  trail  and
close to an hour of time. I left at noon, reached the car at  3:00  and  did
beat the weather (5.5 miles, 500 ft, 3  hrs).  The  parking  lot  was  still
empty.

Trip Total: 16 miles and 4400 ft in 2 days

Wednesday, November 10: Tyee Mtn and Pk 6907 - My intention was to drive  up
the Mad River Road, FR 5700 and FR  5713  from  Ardenvoir  as  far  as  snow
allowed and ski from that point on, my main  goals  being  Tyee  Mtn  and  3
peaks on Tyee Ridge. I would camp out one night. Helped by  much  less  snow
than expected and  heavy  elk  hunter  traffic  making  tracks  I  was  very
surprised when I was able to drive all the way to  Tyee  Mtn  Lookout  (elev
6654). I was also a little disappointed as I really  wanted  to  ski  there,
although driving the final 3 miles on the  steep  narrow  road  in  my  Jeep
through 4-6 inches of new snow was an adventure in  itself.  After  checking
out the lookout I returned to the last switchback to park at  the  beginning
of the Tyee Ridge Trail, elev 6400 ft.

I now revised my plans. I had thought to access the peaks farther in  around
Cougar Meadow on another trip from the South Tommy Trail, but  since  I  was
able to drive so far I thought I could include them on this one if I took  3
days. I was prepared to do so. Weather wise this would probably  also  work.
Wednesday and Thursday were forecast sunny. Precipitation  was  to  come  in
Thursday evening but Friday was supposed to be nice once again.

What with the slow drive on snowy back roads and the side trip to Tyee  Mtn,
I didn\'t start on the trail until 12:30. I hoped to camp at  Boiling  Spring
5.5 miles away. I didn\'t want to have to melt snow for  water  if  I  didn\'t
have to. The Tyee  Ridge  Trail  is  built  for  motorcycles  and  would  be
excellent for skiing with a little more snow cover. As it was there was  not
quite enough, particularly at the beginning. The trail does a lot of up  and
down over several bumps on the ridge  and  a  few  of  the  steeper  rockier
sections I had to walk. Much of the ridge has dead  downed  trees  from  the
Tyee Fire of a few years back making most  off  trail  travel  difficult  on
skis. Conditions got better the farther I went.  At the closest point to  Pk
6907 I left skis and pack to easily hike up to  that  summit.  Since  I  was
running out of daylight I passed on Pk 6998 and Signal Peak on  the  way  in
planning on picking them up on the way out.

Darkness fell as I rounded Pt 6418. I expected the trail to  lead  right  to
Boiling Spring, as shown on all my maps. It did  not.  The  trail  has  been
rerouted. The South Tommy Junction is also not where shown  on  the  map.  I
was almost  all  the  way  to  the  saddle  below  Ghost  Tree  Hill  before
concluding I was completely bypassing the spring. I backtracked Â½  mile  and
found the old unmarked unmaintained trail leading to  Boiling  Spring,  elev
5960 ft. By the time I set up my full winter tent, found a way to get  water
from the spring without falling in and had dinner it  was  9:40  and  I  was
more than ready to turn in without further  entertainment.  Everything  just
takes longer in the dark and cold. And it did seem  unusually  cold.  Things
were freezing  instantly.  My  water  bottle  had  become  solid  slush  and
undrinkable until I added hot  water.  I  checked  my  thermometer  and  was
shocked to discover it read 7.7 degrees! I had a hard time believing at  the
time that it really was that cold especially since it  said  15  degrees  in
the morning. But I checked at home and the minimum recorded  in  the  memory
was 7.7 degrees so it was true. It was clear at  night  and  cloudy  in  the
morning and that could account for the rise in temperature. 7  degrees  ties
for the coldest night I have ever spent out.  By morning  my  water  bucket,
inside the tent, had frozen solid to 2 inches deep all around. Wherever  did
this cold come from? The forecast for the area was only  the  low  twenties.
However, I spent a toasty night in my winter bag with  down  parka,  booties
and hot water bottle to keep me warm.

Total: 7 miles, 1800 ft and 6:45 hrs

Thursday, November 11: Ghost Tree Hill, Cougar Mtn and Whistling Pig Hill  -
It is hard to get going when it is so cold and the  sun  isn\'t  shining.  It
took a while for my feet to warm up despite toe warmers in  my  boots.  From
camp I skied up a semi open slope that had the look of  an  old  fire  break
directly to Ghost Tree Saddle. There was enough snow  and  the  terrain  was
open enough that I could ski to the summit of Ghost Tree  Hill.  I  wondered
which of the many rime covered trees gave the hill its name.

I had a nice ski down to the saddle and  down  and  then  up  the  trail  to
Cougar Mtn. By the time I reached the summit the sun was out  and  I  had  a
pleasant lunch in its warmth. I half skied, half hiked down the N  ridge  to
Cougar Meadow where skiing was again good.  I  had  seen  from  Cougar  that
Whistling Pig Hill was all forested except for the very top  and  would  not
be skiable so I ditched skis a little below the meadow and hiked the  narrow
trail to Whistling Pig Meadow and on to  the  summit  arriving  at  2:40.  I
could see weather obscuring the Stuart Range and coming my way. Sure  enough
it began snowing on the way back to camp which I reached at 6:00. With  more
time on my hands I entertained myself with a video on my IPod  before  going
to sleep. It snowed 2-3 inches during the night and was very windy.

Total: 10 miles, 3100 ft and 9:30 hrs

Friday, November 12: Signal Pk and Pk 6998 - As predicted  the  morning  was
sunny although the sun did not reach me until I was ready to leave at  8:40.
It was also  much  warmer,  27  degrees,  the  wind  had  lessened  and  the
altimeter had dropped 200 ft, a significant rise in pressure. With  the  new
snow and wind much of my in track was obliterated but the skiing was  pretty
good. I was able to ski all the way to the  summit  of  Signal  Pk  on  open
terrain. Signal has two summits. Fortunately the SW is the higher as the  NE
peak is rocky and looked to be quite challenging.

I could also ski to the summit of Pk 6998, winding my way through a  ghostly
landscape of charred "broomstick"  trees.  Skiing  out  remained  reasonable
until the final mile or so  where  the  sun  had  already  melted  the  thin
snowcover on the south facing slopes to reveal rocks.  I  definitely  put  a
few new scratches on my skis. Good thing they were  an  old  pair.  It  took
much longer to get out than I had hoped  as  it  all  seemed  uphill  (maybe
because it was) and muscles unaccustomed to skiing, especially with a  heavy
pack, were getting tired. It probably wasn\'t the best idea to make my  first
ski trip of the season an overnight. At least I reached the car before  dark
(3:15).

November 16, 2010

I had hoped to climb Pear Butte from Bumping Lake. I had  missed  this  peak
last winter on a ski tour to the area from White Pass. Well, it is  not  the
best idea to travel back roads  the  day  after  a  major  windstorm.  After
dodging much debris, numerous limbs and even sawing through one  small  tree
I was stopped dead by two large downed trees a very short way  up  the  Deep
Cr Road 1808 and a long way from Pear Butte.  What to do now? I wasn\'t  sure
but thought about  various  options  as  I  started  walking  up  the  road,
completely snowfree to start. Weather varied  from  cloudy  to  sun  breaks,
with fresh snow at higher elevations.

 I considered just going up Mt Aix  but  couldn\'t  get  excited  about  that
prospect. The road is officially closed and barricaded  slightly  after  the
Mt Aix TH. I was unaware of this. Then I ran into a horrible area  of  fresh
blowdown. Dozens of huge trees had come off the  steep  hillside  above  and
littered the road with an impenetrable mess. It probably took me 30  minutes
to get through that. After 3.5 miles I was  getting  discouraged  and  bored
with road walking and I was only half way to the end of  the  road.  It  was
clear I wouldn\'t have the time  or  patience  for  Pear  Butte.  So  at  the
crossing of Deep Cr (the bridge mostly intact) I changed goals  to  Pk  5810
and Miners Ridge. This went much better at the  start  than  the  steep  map
contours would indicate with small talus and nice  open  woods.  Then  where
the terrain moderated at a drainage I hit  a  large  several  acre  area  of
horrible blowblown where I think every tree in the vicinity came down  in  a
jumble of now snow covered debris. There was no way around it and I lost  an
hour in strenuous effort. Once past that it was  good  going  again  to  the
nondescript summit.

From Pk 5810 I descended easily to the saddle above  Granite  Lake,  crossed
Road 1809 and began a  rising  traverse  to  Miners  Ridge.  I  was  finally
starting to have fun and I enjoyed this peak. It was interesting terrain  as
I wound my way through minor cliffs, not brushy, had few blowdowns  and  the
upper part was good step kicking on snow. Then it threw me a curve  ball  as
the summit turned out to be a snowy rocky ridge  requiring  tricky  insecure
exposed moves the last 20-30 feet. Definitely class 4 under the  conditions.
I was not expecting this at all and had no rope along. I stuffed a  register
in a crack on top as daylight ended. Going down by headlamp was  even  worse
and quite nerve wracking. After that  I  followed  my  tracks  back  to  the
saddle and Granite Lake Road 1809 (a few more large blowdowns on  this  (but
nothing horrible) back to my car for what ended up being a  satisfying  loop
trip. No photos. Nothing to take a picture of.

Total: 11 miles, 3700 ft and 8:30 hrs

That is not the end. I thought I was being  so  clever  to  beat  the  storm
predicted for Wednesday to travel over Chinook Pass on Tuesday. In fact  the
pass was clear and easy going Tuesday morning. I  figured  they  would  most
likely close the pass on Wednesday.  But on the  return  I  discovered  they
had closed the pass at noon on Tuesday  in  ANTICIPATION  of  the  Wednesday
storm. I couldn\'t believe it. Tuesday night was still  clear  with  no  snow
coming down. What really annoyed me was  there  was  no  warning  they  were
going to do this. I passed the reader board in Enumclaw  that  usually  says
when the pass is closed and it was blank. I had no idea it was closed  until
I hit the barricade on the east side. I had to turn around  and  go  through
Yakima adding several hours to my drive time. I was not happy.      Fay

Mt Finn (5280+ ft - P400 - Scenic Quad) - December 1, 2010

Somehow I had never gotten around to climbing this peak. When I  climbed  Mt
Sawyer and Tonga Ridge years ago I wasn\'t even  aware  that  it  existed.  I
thought it would make a fine ski trip. And so  it  would  with  better  snow
conditions and a shorter approach by being able to drive  part  way  up  the
Tonga Ridge Road. On this day I could get no farther than  the  RR  trestle,
the usual end of plowing, elev 1280 ft. From this point it is much  too  far
on the main road to make the top in a  day  trailbreaking  alone.  But  Road
6820 takes off from this point going up the north side  of  Tonga  Ridge.  I
had never been up this road before and had no idea what shape it was in  but
it looked more direct and I decided to give it a try.

As I was getting ready to start two tough dudes in a  Toyota  4X4  drove  up
and stopped to put on chains. That took them all  of  5  minutes.  Obviously
they had done this before many times.  It  usually  takes  me  at  least  30
minutes to put mine on. They then continued up the untracked road. I  wasn\'t
even tempted to follow in their tracks. I had enough  trouble  just  getting
my vehicle parked off the road right where I was and I sure didn\'t  want  to
chance getting stuck farther on.

Road 6820 is gated a short ways up, past the train tracks. The  road  is  in
good shape the whole way with a nice grade  for  skiing.  Unfortunately  the
snow was not as good as I had expected. It started as deep heavy slush  with
intermittent freezing rain crust in  open  areas  that  made  for  difficult
trailbraking. I was expecting deep snow but more powdery and not so wet  and
certainly not freezing rain way down here. The snow level must have shot  up
momentarily overnight. I knew right away that I would  get  out  well  after
dark - if I was even able to make it all the way to the top. Not  that  that
bothered me. I don\'t mind skiing roads by headlamp.

The snow improved a little as I got higher, thank heavens or I  never  would
have made it. Road 6820 is blocked by a mound just before  intersecting  the
main Tonga Ridge Road 6830 at 3880 ft (5 miles, 2700,4  hrs).  I  skied  the
short distance on the main road to Rd 310 and 1.3 miles on this spur to  the
Tonga Ridge TH (6.3 miles, 3200 ft, 5:20 hrs). Skiing  was  pretty  good  on
the trail. Where it started down off the ridge at the second saddle  I  left
it and headed for the summit of Mt  Finn  along  the  ridge.  The  snow  was
finally the powder  I  had  hoped  for  but  there  was  a  lot  of  it  and
trailbeaking slow. I emerged on top with no light left (8 miles, 4300 ft,  8
hrs).

The ski off Finn was very nice indeed as was  the  trail.  The  road  varied
from good to reasonable to awful. The problem was the freezing  rain  crust.
In places I could stay on top. Other times I broke through the  crust.  What
with these problems it took 2.5 hours to ski  down  the  road.  With  better
snow I bet it would take half that time and be a splendid run.

When Stefan proposed skiing on Saturday I couldn\'t pass it up even though  I
was still worn out from my  12  hour  trailbreaking  marathon  the  previous
Wednesday. While we did have to do a little head scratching to come up  with
a suitable peak that neither of us had done before, this turned out to be  a
delightful trip.

We were able to drive 1.2 miles to 3200 ft up Road 1500,  which  leaves  Hwy
12 slightly past the junction of Tieton Road at the  end  of  Rimrock  Lake.
Here we came across three parked vehicles, one a truck  that  had  obviously
unloaded a snow cat. The cat track made skiing a breeze. It  was  almost  as
good as a groomed road. No trailbreaking for us this  day.  In  addition  we
saw signs of a wheeled vehicle continuing up the road. Sure enough  we  came
across this SUV, chains on all four wheels,  parked  at  4600  ft  some  3.5
miles farther on. That was some serious  4X4  snow  driving.   Interestingly
all four vehicles, this one and the three below, had out of state  licenses,
Idaho, Texas and Arizona. This resulted in endless speculation on  our  part
as to the reason and kept us entertained for much of the way up.

Bethel Ridge is an interesting  long  flat  ridge  with  a  cliffy  southern
escarpment. Due to rocks and light snow cover we could  not  take  a  direct
shortcut to the summit (at least on skis) and  had  to  stick  to  the  road
which hits the crest well east of the top. By this time we were so close  we
decided to visit the tower and see what the story  was.  We  sure  surprised
the guys working there. There were six of them and  they  were  doing  major
repairs/renovations to the communication tower. Five were tower  contractors
from out of state. Due to  snafus  in  planning  and  obtaining  the  needed
equipment they were running late in their schedule and  got  caught  by  the
snow. They then had to bring in another guy from Idaho  with  the  cat.  The
cat only held 5 in the cab. The sixth had to sit outside in the  back  cargo
area, which looked very uncomfortable and cold to me. He drove up as far  as
possible in his 4X4 to lessen his time in the cat. They  came  up  each  day
and stayed the night in either Yakima or Packwood.

After our visit, we left the road and skied along  the  flat  ridge  to  the
summit about 0.75 miles away (9 miles, 3400 ft, 4:40 hrs). The  snow  here  was
very nice and trailbreaking easy. The temperature was 19 degrees.  While  on
the summit Stefan discovered his favorite  hat  was  missing  and  while  he
backtracked to find it I started down. I found a skiable  shortcut  slightly
to the east directly down to the road below. I cut several more  switchbacks
with some decent skiing before having to the stick to the road the  rest  of
the way. The road was a good grade for skiing despite the  cat  track  being
quite fast. I could either snowplow or go into powder on the shoulder  if  I
had to slow down. It was really a very pleasant run down.  Just  before  the
car Stefan caught up to me. He had found his hat.  We  reached  the  car  at
4:15 with no headlamps required. I was in danger of  ruining  my  reputation
for late night returns. Stefan had even warned his wife not  to  expect  him
until very late as my last trip I hadn\'t gotten home  until  midnight.  This
time even with the long drive we were both back by 7:30. What  a  difference
snow conditions  can  make.  This  trip  was  about  the  same  distance  as
Wednesday\'s but took half the time.

Credit Don and Natala for giving me the idea to ski up this peak.  They  did
it on snowshoes  on  November  27.  Somehow  I  talked  Karen  Daubert  into
accompanying me. I\'m not sure she knew what she was getting into  but  I  am
grateful she came along as without her  help  trailbreaking  I  never  would
have made it. And she was great company. She was on heavy alpine gear  while
I used my usual light three-pin skis.

Don and Natala were able to drive 3.5 miles up Road  1690  to  3400  ft.  No
such luck for us. We got less than a mile (elev 2160 ft), as far as  it  was
plowed to homes, and had to squeeze in on the side of the road to  park  out
of the way. Trailbreaking was difficult right from the start  and  only  got
worse as we got higher. The snow was that  awful  Cascade  concrete  we  all
know and "love" - as wet and heavy as it could  possibly  be  without  being
liquid. It snowed most of the day, quite heavily at times.

It took us 3 hours to go the 4 miles to the Round Mtn TH at 3960 ft.  I  had
hoped things would improve once on the trail. They  didn\'t.  They  only  got
worse as the snow got deeper and deeper.  It was only  1.5  miles  on  trail
from here to the top but after 2.5 hours more of strenuous  effort  we  were
not even to the ridge and still about Â½ mile away. It was  3:00  and  Karen,
worried about skiing down the trail in the dark, decided she had had  enough
and reasonably decided  to  turn  around.  I,  not  being  known  for  being
particularly reasonable, gave Karen the car keys  and  stubbornly  continued
up alone. I struggled and wallowed in incredibly  deep  snow,  often  up  my
thighs. At times I could barely move. To make matters  worse  the  last  few
hundred feet were quite steep. Desperate, I tried taking off my  skis  so  I
could climb straight up. I sank in over my waist. I almost gave up. It  took
me until 4:20 to reach the top, 1:20 hours to go less than Â½ mile!

The snow was so deep I could not really ski down out of the track. And  when
I fell, and I did, it was disastrous getting up  again.  Once  back  on  the
trail the skiing was pretty good and the road was delightful. I  have  Karen
to thank for that as she set a nice track down. I  am  sure  she  went  much
slower than I did in the new snow. Because of this she hadn\'t  been  waiting
too long (about 45 minutes) at the car by the time I arrived at 6:45.

Total: 11 miles, 3750 ft and 9 hrs

Udono Pk (4830 ft - P510 - Lake Shannon Quad) - December 19, 2010

This turned out  to  be  an  unexpectedly  delightful  ski  trip  with  good
weather, excellent snow conditions and mellow skiing. I wasn\'t sure I  would
be able to drive Jackman Creek Road  14  (off  Hwy  20  past  Concrete)  far
enough to get close to the peak but  I  was.   I  got  to  the  crossing  of
Jackman Creek about 7 miles in where an open  section  with  deep  snow  had
been chewed up by previous 4X4 traffic. I decided to stop  here  (elev  1920
ft) rather than risk getting stuck. I could have driven farther as once  the
road entered trees again the snow cover was very light with rocks showing.

The beginning of the road had previous 4X4 and ATV traffic but  that  didn\'t
greatly affect skiing as the shoulder was wide and the road smooth.  It  was
a beautiful sunny but cold day (21 degrees on top). All signs  of  vehicular
traffic ended about 2 miles up where  I  began  breaking  my  own  trail  in
lovely light powder. I followed the road, with increasingly  nice  views  of
Sauk Mtn across Jackman Cr, to the saddle SE of Udono Pk where a short  spur
led to the SW ridge. Here I left my skis and  kicked  steps  up  the  wooded
ridge to the gentle summit where I was rewarded with a gorgeous view  of  Mt
Baker for lunch. I ended the short day (I had gotten a late  start)  with  a
most pleasant run down the road by the light of a full moon.

Total: 10 miles, 3200 ft and 6 hrs

Cement Mtn (4769 ft - P529) and  Pk  4795  (P515)  -  Lake  Shannon  Quad  -
December 21, 2010

I had so much fun on Udono that I returned two  days  later  for  these  two
peaks. This time I drove Â½ mile farther where I knew there was a good  place
to turn around. I also got an earlier start. The lower  road  was  much  the
same with an additional 2-3 inches of snow, but it was warmer and  the  snow
wetter to start. It became better the higher I got (29 degrees  on  Cement).
It was also cloudier but still quite nice. I quickly retraced  my  route  to
Udono Saddle skiing my old track. From the saddle I picked up  a  spur  road
leading  toward  Cement  Mtn  which  ended  on  a  steep  sidehill.  It  was
challenging forcing a route through thick trees to the saddle to the  NE  of
the summit but once at the saddle the terrain was skiable  all  the  way  to
top (2800 ft, 4:15 hrs). It was wooded with no views.

I was back at Udono Saddle at 2:30. Cement had taken longer  than  expected.
I only had two hours of daylight left.  I  knew  I  couldn\'t  make  Pk  4795
before dark and yet I wasn\'t ready to turn around. The snow was so lovely  I
just had to continue on the road. Besides I was ready for a  workout  before
being sidelined by holiday responsibilities. And so I followed  the  road  2
more miles to the saddle E of Pk 4795. I left skis, got out my ice  axe  and
kicked steps up the very steep E ridge. It was slow going. I  broke  out  of
the dense trees onto a gentler corniced  ridge  that  would  have  had  nice
views had it not now been dark. I reached a high point  and  could  see  the
lights of Concrete and thought I was on top. My GPS said otherwise  -  still
200 linear feet to go. Darn! I went down slightly then farther W  along  the
ridge and back up a bit where I was confronted by a  rock  pinnacle.  Double
darn! Where the heck did this come from? I spent the next 20 minutes  trying
to find a way up it. To the right looked impossible so I went down left  and
traversed. It might go but was very exposed and since I  had  nothing  other
than an ice axe with me and  I  wanted  to  live  to  climb  another  day  I
retreated. In the end I climbed and stemmed between  a  tree  and  the  rock
wall right on the ridge to where I could  almost  spit  on  the  summit  and
called it good (3800 ft, 8 hrs). I may return another day to try again  from
the west or wait until summer to drive the road and climb under  less  snowy
conditions. Then again, I may not.

I had a mystical ski down the road by the light of a partially clouded  full
moon. Then it was shattered as I got to the lower road  and  saw  headlights
of a vehicle. I passed a beefy 4X4 truck stopped at the end of the  previous
old track with 6 young people. I am not  sure  who  was  more  surprised  at
meeting someone at 7:30 in the dark, them or me. At  this  point  the  truck
was wheel deep and dragging bottom but they seemed  unconcerned  and  to  be
having a good time. It amazes me that some people get great pleasure out  of
driving up snowy roads as far  as  they  can  go,  getting  stuck  and  then
driving back down. Crazy! Not that climbing up peaks,  touching  the  summit
and climbing back down is at all similar.

Total: 16 miles, 4100 ft 10:45 hrs

Friday, December 31: West Church Ridge - The wildlife gate on Road 3120  was
closed so I had to start from there. I was surprised at the  lack  of  snow,
maybe an inch or two of fresh light powder over no base, and had to  walk  a
mile or so before I put on my skis. Even  then  coverage  remained  marginal
until about 3000 ft in  many  places.  I  guess  the  previous  recent  warm
weather and heavy rains had decimated the lowland snowpack in this area.

Since I was also planning on skiing up West Church Ridge  the  logical  spot
to camp was at the road junction but when I got there it was  all  in  shade
and unappealing so I continued to Church Saddle (3.5 miles,  1400  ft,  2.30
hrs). Here I found a pleasant spot in the afternoon sun with a  view  of  Mt
Baker. I couldn\'t have asked for  more.  Being  in  the  sun  made  all  the
difference in comfort as I set up camp.

While arranging things inside my tent I  heard  a  strange  shuffling  sound
outside like something moving. I poked my head out shocked to see  3  skiers
going by. Where the heck did they come from? There were no tracks  ahead  of
me on the road although there was another vehicle parked at the  gate.  They
had come from West Church and said they  approached  up  "the  gully".  What
gully? I didn\'t know there was a route up a gully. But  any  lowland  cross-
country travel couldn\'t be very good given the lack  of  snow.  They  hadn\'t
made the summit saying they were about 1.5  hours  away  when  they  turned
around. I was a little fuzzy on the details of it all. They  were  in  heavy
AT gear (well actually one guy was on a split board), which to  me  was  not
well suited to this route until quite high on the mountain. Maybe  they  too
thought there would be more snow cover. I think they were  as  surprised  to
see me as I was to see them.

I started for West Church Ridge at 3:40  retracing  my  route  to  the  road
junction. I didn\'t mind as I was looking for ways to kill time and make  the
night shorter. I reached the towers at the end of the road just in time  for
a sunset view of Mt Baker. When I  returned  to  camp  the  temperature  was
already 17 degrees and dropping (4 miles, 1000 ft, 2:20 hrs RT). I  snuggled
in for a long night entertaining myself with a leisurely dinner,  music  and
2 videos on my IPod between naps. At midnight I toasted the  New  Year  with
Irish Cream laced hot chocolate (yum) and emerged from my tent  for  a  view
of a clear starlit sky. As  a  bonus  I  was  treated  to  a  few  fireworks
courtesy of the tiny town of Glacier which I could see directly below me.  I
reheated my hot water bottle before turning in for  good  to  spend  a  warm
comfortable night.

Saturday, January 1: West Church - It is hard to get going early when it  is
13 degrees and it doesn\'t get light  until  7:30.  It  didn\'t  help  that  I
forgot my ice axe and had to return for it.  That  lost  me  30  minutes.  I
think my brain was frozen. I finally  got  underway  for  real  at  8:30.  I
followed the road all the way to the end at 4100 ft  (1:20  hrs).  Here  the
skier\'s tracks ended. Darn! I had hoped they would  have  made  a  track  at
least part way up the mountain. They were no help at all.  I  sure  expected
them to have gotten farther. I was really  puzzled  as  to  the  purpose  of
their trip. AT gear and they never got beyond the end of the road?

I now had my work cut out for me. The first  bit  above  the  road  was  too
steep and forested for skis so I kicked steps until things opened up  and  I
could put skis on again. The higher I got the better the snow cover  became,
beautiful light powder. In places it was quite deep, but as I ventured  onto
the wide open south slopes I began running into a  tricky  hard  crust  only
lightly covered where my skis would occasionally lose their  grip  and  slip
downhill. It wasn\'t everywhere  but  quite  disconcerting  when  encountered
especially as the slope got steeper with no runout.  Not  wanting  to  slide
uncontrollably out of sight downhill, I finally gave up on  skiing,  stashed
the skis and kicked steps the rest of the  way.  It  was  fairly  good  step
kicking not being hard enough to require crampons.  The  terrain  forced  me
toward the false summit from where I followed the ridge to the summit  (2800
ft, 3:50 hrs). It had taken 2.5 hrs from road end. The skier\'s  estimate  of
being 1.5 hrs from the top was a little optimistic.

The summit of West Church was a broad snow mound with a gorgeous view,  well
worth waiting for a sunny clear day. Church Mtn was  especially  impressive.
Now that would be a challenging winter climb. Once back to  my  skis  I  had
some good downhill to the road and a great run down the road itself  despite
5 annoying small open creek crossings. I reached my tent in  1.5  hours  at
2:00 (7 miles, 2800 ft, 5:30 hrs RT),  quickly  packed  up  (once  again  in
sun!), skied as far as I possibly could  (adding  a  few  new  scratches  to
already scratched ski bases) before being to forced to walk. Even so I  made
it to the car in 1:15 hrs. The end of a great start to 2011.

Total: 18 miles and 5200 ft in 2 days

Damnation Pk (5635 ft - P715 - Damnation Quad) - January 26, 2011

Lisa Loper and I had been planning on climbing Damnation together  for  over
a year just waiting for an intersection of  proper  conditions  and  a  time
when good snow wasn\'t luring me  to  backcountry  skiing.  Her  friend  Bill
joined us when things came together on Wednesday.

Considering how the lowland snowpack has been decimated by the recent  rains
and warm weather, we were somewhat surprised to be stopped by  snow  on  the
Thornton Lakes Road at  1850  ft  about  0.75  mile  before  the  old  spur  up
Damnation Cr. However, this meant we had ample snow cover on  that  road.  I
am not really sure this helped all that much, though, as the snow  was  very
slushy and rotten making for frustrating progress even  with  snowshoes.  We
all  experienced  sinking  into  nasty  holes.  Some  very  large  blowdowns
encountered near the beginning didn\'t help. It took us  2  hours  to  travel
the 2.5 miles to the end of the old  road  at  3150  ft.   But  overall  the
roadbed was in better shape than I expected with minimal brush.

From the road end we  dropped  a  short  way  to  easily  cross  a  fork  of
Damnation Cr. We then worked our way left  through  forest  up  increasingly
steep terrain, a real effort on snowshoes, to the  crest  of  the  southeast
ridge of Damnation. The ridge began to open up around 4100  where  the  snow
became deeper and slushier. Oakes, across Damnation Creek, was the  dominate
view along the lower part of the ridge and is quite an attractive peak  from
this side. Trailbreaking, done mostly by Bill and Lisa, was  work.  A  steep
step, turned on the left, was encountered below the false summit. The  ridge
above this step was lovely with expanded views  in  all  directions  despite
the mostly cloudy conditions. I  was  especially  entranced  by  Triumph  to
Despair, an area that has  given  me  several  challenging  trips  the  past
couple of years. Bill cracked me up when  he  made  the  oh  so  understated
comment, "This does not suck!"

We topped out on the summit at 3:00 (4000 ft, 6:00 hrs) and had  a  pleasant
30 minute rest until the chilly wind and diminishing daylight hours  spurred
on our descent. I descended the whole ridge in  boots  for  greater  control
and for the most part stayed on top in the track.  Bill  and  Lisa  switched
back and forth between snowshoes and  boots  depending  upon  steepness  and
degree of sinking in. We turned on our  headlamps  shortly  before  reaching
the old road at 5:30 where we all put snowshoes on for the final  plod  back
to the car.

Total: 9 miles, 4100 ft and 10:30 hrs.

Quad - February 1, 2011

With skiing continuing to  be  lousy  I  was  casting  about  for  something
interesting to climb with good views to take advantage of the  good  weather
when I received an unexpected invitation from Mike T to join him  for  these
two peaks. Perfect! I had done neither, views of Baker should be superb  and
I hadn\'t been out with Mike in quite some time. I always enjoy his company.

Mike drove in his truck up Road 38 (Middle Fork  Nooksack)  and  about  2.75
miles up Warm Cr Road before being stopped by a deep snow patch at 3100  ft.
He made a gallant effort to plow on through to a bare  section  just  beyond
but it was too deep. We were only Â½ mile from the spur up the south side  of
Stewart and I was happy we got that far. We began walking the road at  10:00
and were at the end of it on the ridge below Stewart in  a  little  over  an
hour. From here someone had cut a cute little trail along the  narrow  ridge
(there was even a hand line on one steep section!) to the flat area  of  the
summit where we had to search around a bit for the high point  (2  Â¼  miles,
1350 ft, 1:45 hrs).

We returned to the last switchback on the road and  followed  the  ridge  to
the 3800 ft saddle with  Groat  Mtn  in  a  clear-cut.  Some  unpleasantness
followed as we worked our way out of the clear-cut into timber. The  terrain
was deceiving as we ran into unforeseen ribs,  gullies  and  rock  outcrops,
none of which was apparent from the map. Once in the trees the  snow  became
so icy and steep I was forced to put  on  crampons.  Mike  somehow  made  do
without. Once above this section the terrain moderated and  even  though  it
looked very steep on the map it was quite reasonable (though still  somewhat
icy) as we worked right to the main south ridge and on to the  false  summit
(3300 ft, 4:30 hrs).  We dropped from here to a broad saddle for  the  final
fun tiptoe along the narrow corniced summit ridge to the top (4 miles,  3600
ft, 5:30 hrs).

Views were outstanding and the sun warm but the air was  cold,  the  shadows
were lengthening and the sun softened snow starting to refreeze so  soon  it
was time to go at 4:00. We retraced our steps to where we had met the  south
ridge then angled left heading for a lower road traversing  the  south  side
we had seen on the way up. I had taken my crampons off  on  the  summit  but
had to put them on again in the  lower  trees  where  the  snow  once  again
turned icy. The whole descent went quite well, though, until just above  the
road where we ran into a multitude of downed trees. And then the  road  that
had  looked  so  obvious  from  a  distance  turned  out  to  be  completely
decommissioned and not all that easy to  follow,  especially  in  the  dark.
Mike did a great job keeping us on  the  line.  I  would  have  gone  astray
several times. We intersected our up route on the  good  road  at  6:00  and
were back to the car at 6:30 to end a very enjoyable climb  with  much  more
interesting peaks than I had thought they would be.

We took snowshoes but never used them. Crampons were the order of the day.

Total: 7 miles, 3800 ft and 8:30 hrs

Mtn Quad - February 8-10, 2011

With Mt Baker reported to have 10 inches new snow I  had  visions  of  great
backcountry skiing. Alas it was not to be. I had nowhere  near  that  amount
and skiing was not all I had hoped it  would  be.   Despite  that  this  was
still a very good trip. Grouse Butte was  more  challenging,  Pk  4926  more
interesting and Pk 4826 more pleasant than expected, even  if  I  wasn\'t  on
skis.

Tuesday, February 8: Grouse Butte - I drove Glacier Cr Road 39  to  milepost
7 (elev 3080) where I was stopped by a  sign  "No  wheeled  vehicles  beyond
this point". Just the sign. No other amenities, not even a turn  around  and
you were on your own finding a spot to park out of the way.  The  snowmobile
rigs must have known this as they were all parked a mile  or  so  back  down
the road where there was more room. This road is well  used  by  snowmobiles
for access to Grouse Ridge and Lookout Mtn, both expansive  play  areas  for
the machines. So I had no trail breaking in  the  several  inches  of  fresh
snow on Roads 39 and 36 all the way to the junction with  3630  (4.5  miles,
1250 ft. 3 hrs). Here I found a secluded campsite in the  saddle  just  east
of Grouse Butte (elev 4160 ft) where the steep sides protected me  from  the
sound and sight of passing machines.

After setting up camp I figured I still had time to make it up Grouse  Butte
before dark even though I left at 4:00. It was only about Â½  mile  and  less
than 1000 feet. How long could it take? Well, a heck of a lot longer than  I
thought. First I found out right away that skiing off road this trip  wasn\'t
going to be very good. Mt Baker may have gotten 10 inches of  new  snow  but
that certainly didn\'t apply here. At most it was 3  inches  in  open  areas,
less in the woods, which was not adequate to cover  the  hard  lumpy  frozen
crust. I soon had to ditch skis for foot travel. Also, although the day  had
started sunny it gradually turned cloudy to the point I was now in fog  with
limited visibility.

Grouse Butte is guarded by cliffs on all sides but the NE which is  where  I
headed up.  It started well but as the slope steepened I quickly  discovered
I had made an almost fatal error in not bringing crampons. With an  expected
10 inches of new snow I really didn\'t think I would need them and I have  to
carry enough stuff for winter camping without taking stuff I don\'t  think  I
will need. Well, in places the snow was not only crusty but icy as well  and
I couldn\'t even kick good steps. I did a lot of  micro  wandering  searching
for good foot placements and I had to chop a few steps.  Then I hit  a  snow
wall that was too steep for me to get up and I was forced to  traverse  left
beneath it. I did eventually find a way through but it was  very  steep,  my
guess 55 degrees or so. Fortunately the snow was such that  I  could  plunge
my axe through the crust in to hilt most of the way  so  I  felt  reasonably
secure. Even so I breathed a sigh of relief when I topped  the  wall.  Above
was easy.

All this wandering around and chopping steps took so long that it  was  6:00
and the sun had set when I reached the summit. However,  Mt  Baker  was  now
above the fog. My photo of this view in low light does not  do  it  justice.
It was absolutely stunning. I enjoyed the view and  what  was  left  of  the
sunset for a few minutes before reality set it. Holy Cow, now I  had  to  go
down that wall! At this point I dearly wished I also had a rope.  There  was
even a nice tree for a rappel. Well, wishing don\'t make it so. There was  no
other alternative but to slowly and carefully back down my steps.  Obviously
I made it and I dragged into camp  at  7:40  somewhat  frazzled.  My  little
jaunt had taken twice as long as expected (1 mile, 1100 ft, 3:30 hrs).

Wednesday, February 9: Pks 4926 & 4846 - I was up  early  on  a  cold  clear
morning (8 degrees). I wanted at least some good skiing and my best bet  was
the open slopes of Grouse Ridge and I wanted to beat the  snowmobilers  that
come in just for the day.  With  this  in  mind  I  was  underway  at  7:30.
Following the snowmobile route from the end of Rd 36 I was on  Grouse  Ridge
at 9:30 just as I heard the first snowmobiles arriving. I found some  mostly
untracked snow for a nice downhill run. Here the snow was really very  good.
On Rd 36 again I ran into more snowmobiles and a groomer (4 miles, 1700  ft,
4 hrs RT to Grouse Ridge)

At 11:30 I started downhill on Rd 3630  to  head  for  PK  4926.  This  road
skirts Grouse Butte on the south. At the switchback I left the road  heading
for the 4000 saddle between Grouse Butte and Pk  4926.  I  stashed  my  skis
here as the terrain was not remotely  skiable.  What  followed  was  a  very
unpleasant traverse through nasty dense woods on a  steep  hillside  lightly
covered with an inch or so of fresh snow over  frozen  duff.  There  was  no
base at all. But once I made it  to  the  saddle  things  improved  and  the
higher I got the better it became as I worked my way up the SE ridge to  the
summit. The snow was very good for step  kicking  and  the  ridge  partially
open and quite interesting with a cliff on the south. Unfortunately  another
day that had started clear and sunny once again turned cloudy and foggy  and
I had few views. I reached the summit at 2:30.

Then it was down the lovely open gentle  north  and  west  ridge  (would  be
great skiing if I had my skis) to the 4400 ft saddle with Pk 4846. The  easy
SE ridge led to that summit at 3:45. It was all in woods but pleasant  going
and since it was foggy no views did not matter. I followed  my  tracks  back
to the 4000 saddle, did some slipping and sliding  down  slick  frozen  dirt
and emerged at my skis and Rd 3630 again at  6:00.  Darned  if  the  groomer
hadn\'t been down this road too which made it an easy ski  back  to  camp  at
7:00 (6.5 miles, 2700 ft, 7:30 hrs).

Thursday, February 10 - This morning was a  little  warmer  at  14  degrees.
With no agenda I slept in and didn\'t  leave  until  9:30  just  as  all  the
snowmobiles were streaming in. It was a gorgeous sunny  morning,  maybe  the
best of the three days but by now there would be no untracked snow  left  to
ski on Grouse Ridge. I stopped often to take in views.  Near the car  I  ran
into two Border Patrol officers on foot walking down the road. I stopped  to
chat. They said they were just out for a stroll  and  getting  to  know  the
area but they were armed with the big weapons. Made  me  wonder.  (200,  4.5
miles, 2 hrs)

Total: 20.5 miles and 6950 ft in 3 days

Allen Mtn (5095 ft - P615 - Sawtooth Ridge Quad) - February 13, 2011

Sunday - I got so excited with the first prospect of new snow for skiing  in
a while I couldn\'t wait to get out. I think I  jumped  the  gun  a  bit,  at
least as far as this trip was concerned. I parked on  Rd  8440  at  3100  ft
where the old snow was covered by an inch or so of new. This increased to 1-
3 inches as I got higher but that wasn\'t enough for good  off  road  skiing.
Still it was a good trip and skiing on the road to  Towhead  Gap  was  nice.
Once in the trees of the NW ridge above the Gap there  was  only  a  dusting
over bare ground. I hiked this carrying skis hoping I could use them  later.
I did put them on again near the summit where it opened  up  but  it  wasn\'t
very good and I really should have left  the  skis  behind.   Katoolas  were
useful both for the bare frozen ground of the ridge and the summit rocks.

Total: 11 miles, 2150 ft and 6:30 hrs

"Catt Pk" (5120+ ft - P800) and "Greenwood Pt" (4982 ft - P382)  -  Sawtooth
Ridge Quad - February 16, 2011

Wednesday - What a treasure this peak turned out to  be!  I  parked  in  the
same place as Sunday and was lucky to get that far as there  was  a  good  6
inches of fresh snow on the road. I skied the main road about 1.5  miles  to
a spur right. This was probably a mistake as it was overgrown and  had  some
blowdown to start. But at least the bridge over Catt Cr was still intact.  A
better choice would have been a second spur another mile  up  road.  It  was
farther but would have made for better skiing.  Anyway,  I  stuck  with  the
first spur and it did improve as I got higher. I followed it to  a  clearing
at 3700 ft then went straight uphill to cross the end of the second spur  at
4200 ft. The new snow depth was now over a foot and breaking trail slow  and
laborious. Steep slopes above this led to Rd 8511 on the ridgeline  which  I
crossed to lovely terrain on the NW slope.

I had been in fog and light snow up to now when all  of  a  sudden  the  sun
came out just in time for my final ascent up  the  delightful  NW  ridge  of
Catt Pk. It was gorgeous skiing. I sure didn\'t expect this  peak  to  be  so
nice. I reached the summit at 3:00 (4 miles,  2150  ft,  5  hrs).  I  had  a
pleasant 30 minute lunch in the sun where views came and went but were  good
enough to lure me into continuing on the ridgeline to make a big loop  trip.
I had a wonderful ski down the E ridge to  intersect  Rd  8511,  skied  this
road to its end, climbed over Greenwood Pt, skied down to  a  broad  saddle,
up and over the next bump and along the flat ridge  until  I  could  descend
toward Cougar Gap. From here I fully expected problems forcing a route  down
upper Catt Cr drainage but in fact it turned out  to  be  not  half  bad.  I
followed a series of open glades down into the  trees  and  even  there  the
forest was open enough that it was quite skiable. I only had to remove  skis
once for a crossing of Catt Cr. Here I was treated to the spectacular  sight
of a full moon rising above snowy trees. I  emerged  onto  the  second  spur
whose bridge got me across Catt Cr again and to main  Rd  8440  at  7:30.  I
ended with a gentle 2.5 miles run down the road and back to the car  to  end
one of the best ski tours I have had all year.

Total: 10 miles, 2800 ft and 10:45 hrs.

"East Rock" (5120+ ft - P480 - Sawtooth Ridge Quad) - February 18, 2011

Friday - Skiing was so good on Catt Pk I was back again two days  later  and
once again parked in the same spot. No one had been on road in the  interim.
There were another couple of inches of new snow,  not  enough  to  cover  my
tracks from Wednesday so I only had to break new  trail  starting  from  the
second spur at 2.5 miles. At Towhead Gap (4.5 miles) I continued on Rd  8440
downhill another mile until I could  head  uphill  to  the  4600  ft  saddle
between High Rock and East Rock. I ran into a good trail  below  the  saddle
which made for easy travel, especially on the way back. I  followed  the  NW
ridge from the saddle until it turned narrow and rocky about  .2  mile  from
the top where I left my skis. Now things got  interesting  and  it  took  me
over an hour to go this short  distance.  But  I  expected  some  difficulty
here. I had seen Klenke\'s photo of East Rock on List of John\'s  website  and
knew it could be problematic under snowy conditions and  so  it  was.  There
was not enough snow cover to make for good step kicking to start so I  began
by very carefully "crawling " the crest on a line just between  the  cornice
on the left and the solid rock on the right. At a notch  I  was  forced  off
the crest onto the steep exposed right-hand slope  but  here  the  snow  was
deeper and stepkicking feasible. I traversed past the icy summit rocks  then
worked back up through better snow and trees to approach the top from the  S
ridge. The very top was an overhanging cornice  which  I  stayed  well  back
from (2500 ft, 5:45 hr).

With route established and steps kicked it took much less time to return  to
skis at which point I had a wonderful ski down the remainder  of  the  ridge
and the trail to Rd 8440. At the road I was shocked to find fresh tracks  of
a lone snowmobile. This is the first sign of use of this area  by  others  I
saw all week. Then again it was the beginning of a long holiday weekend.  Oh
well. It did make for a faster return up and down the road.

Total: 12.5 miles, 2900 ft and 9 hrs

The approach for all three trips was from Highway 706 near Ashford to  Skate
Cr Rd 52, Rd 85 and Rd 8440.

Uprising Pt (5124 ft) - Friday, February 25, 2011 - Jim and I have been trying to ski this area for some time just waiting for the right conditions. We hit them in spades this past Friday with cold powder (15 degrees to start) and sunshine.  Rarely do things come together so perfectly. We had thought to get up Revolution as I had remembered that peak as not being very difficult when I climbed it on my way to Russian Butte many years ago. But when we got a look at it, it didn\'t really look all that ski friendly. Besides we were running out of time. So we stopped at the 5124 ft knoll to the SW which Jim appropriately dubbed Uprising Pt. This is basically a long road tour, which both Jim and I enjoy but we were treated to the added unexpected bonus of a fantastic though short downhill on the upper slopes of the mountain. There are possibilities for extending the downhill and the area warrants further exploration in the future. I am sure we will be back in the future when conditions allow. It was exciting to discover a new place for me to ski so close to home.
On the run down the W ridge we came across a sturdy cabin perched in a very exposed location. I do not remember seeing this cabin when I climbed Revolution but it is quite weathered and appears to have been there for some time. Puzzling was how to gain access to it as the only door was ten feet off the ground. Perhaps a ladder was buried under the snow somewhere. I notice the GT map shows a 40 acre private in holding at the cabin location.
Total: 15 miles, 4500 ft and 9 hrs.
Mt Teneriffe (4788 ft) - Tuesday, March 1, 2011 - This is another tour that requires a low snow level. I have climbed Teneriffe many times and skied the road often but have never skied all the way to summit. I usually run out of energy before getting there as it is a long way via road and I am always breaking trail alone. I thought I would have help this time as I read on NWHikers that Suzanne H and friends had snowshoed to Dixie Pk on Saturday so I thought I would have their track to help me part of the way. Well forget that. I couldn\'t even see their track. I would guess there was at least 1 ½ feet of new snow since they had been up. And it was wet heavy snow to start. The powder of Friday and Saturday was gone. Nevertheless I persevered and the snow became much better above 3000 ft. But I certainly got a good workout. I was pleasantly surprised that the skiing was no nice from the end of the road at the saddle along the trail over the false summit. When I came down no one had been up the road past the first 1 ½ miles where it begins to steepen.

Two more road tours made possible by the low snowline, one near Glacier  the
other near Hamilton.

Yakso Mtn (4098 ft - P458 - Glacier Quad) - Friday, March 4, 2011  -  I  had
missed out on this little peak on two previous trips to the north (Bald  and
Black) due to lack of time. Conditions were now right  to  ski  the  private
gated logging road on the south directly from the Mt Baker Hwy  at  800  ft.
When I arrived at the gate I found it open. Darn.  This  was  not  good  and
could only mean one thing - active logging.   Fortunately  the  logging  was
immediately to the right at the very first junction and did not  affect  the
road I took to the left. There was enough snow to ski right  from  the  car.
It began crusty then improved to softer with a fresh cover as I got  higher.
The road was in good shape with an easy grade  that  required  no  need  for
full skins. Stefan and Greg had walked most  of  this  road  to  climb  both
Yakso and Bald a year or so ago. Skiing is much more fun.

The day started partly sunny. I even had a decent view of Mt  Baker  in  the
morning but by noon the weather began deteriorating and by afternoon it  was
snowing hard. No matter. The peak is mostly forested and views  are  limited
anyway. I caught only glimpses of Bald and  Black.  Besides  I  love  making
tracks in fresh snow. The final spur started  overgrown  but  improved  near
the top. The summit was in dense forest slightly off the  spur  and  someone
had marked it with flagging hanging off a tree branch  (Stefan?).   The  run
down was very pleasant although the last mile was thin, slushy  and  in  the
rain. As expected when I reached the car the gate was closed.

Total: 14 miles, 3300 ft and 7:30 hrs

Mt Josephine (3957 ft - P1317) and Mt Napoleon (3240+ ft - P560) -  Hamilton
Quad - Sunday, March 6, 2011 - I had always thought the long gentle road  up
the west side of Mt Josephine would make a fine ski trip. And so it  did.  I
drove DNR roads from Harry Osborne TH near Hamilton  until  stopped  by  wet
snow and parked at 1160 ft. Snow was continuous from that  point  on  though
thin to start but again got better higher. The road has several  quite  long
level sections below the Josephine-Napoleon Saddle but steepens above.  From
the saddle on as I entered a more northerly exposure the snow was very  nice
with fresh on both the road and trees.  From there it was another 2.5  miles
to Josephine. The road went all the way to the  top.  I  had  expected  some
nice views as the forecast was sunny and indeed it  had  started  that  way.
But something happened on my way up and by the time I  reached  the  top  it
was foggy, snowing lightly and I  could  see  nothing.  Sound  familiar?  Oh
well, I had a great run back to the saddle where a spur not shown on my  map
led to within 50 feet of the summit of  Napoleon  with  the  sun  out  again
giving a reasonable view of Josephine. I had a nice  run  back  to  the  car
with even the level sections providing very enjoyable gliding.

Cornell Mtn (4760+ ft - P760 - Groat Mtn Quad) - Friday, March 11, 2011

This ended up being a gem of a trip for skiing although it didn\'t start  out
all that promising. I ran into old icy snow almost immediately  on  Rd  3010
right out of the town of Glacier and couldn\'t drive it very far. Because  of
this I decided to ski the spur road (elev 1060 ft) at about .5  mile  rather
than the main road as it appeared more direct and  shorter  by  at  least  a
mile. I originally  had  some  concerns  that  it  would  be  overgrown  and
unskiable as it was not shown on many of my  maps  but  it  looked  fine  to
start. I should have listened to my gut. In less than Â¼ mile  I  came  to  a
berm past which the road was abandoned and overgrown. Darn! It was too  late
to reconsider so I stuck with it. After some  short  initial  unpleasantness
that required walking, it soon became marginally skiable and improved  as  I
climbed higher. After 1.5 hours of this I came to  the  good  road  I  would
have taken had I stayed on Rd  3010  (1300  ft,  2  Â¼  miles).  Things  were
looking up.

Continuing on this nice road I crossed Gallop Cr  on  a  sturdy  bridge  and
began getting into  fresh  snow  and  more  interesting  terrain.  I  passed
several logging spurs heading to other inviting  areas  that  would  warrant
future exploration. After another 1.5 hours  of  gentle  climbing  the  road
curled around to head up the Gallop Cr drainage and entered a  large  clear-
cut. Somewhat past the top of the clear-cut I left the road at  3800  ft  in
forest, skinned up and headed directly for the summit of  Cornell  Mtn  (5.5
miles, 2850 ft, 4:20 hrs). This is where the trip turned  into  a  gem.  The
forest began semi open and quickly expanded  to  a  series  of  lovely  open
glades on the broad north ridge that led all  the  way  to  just  below  the
summit on the east ridge. The skiing was delightful. The summit  itself  was
a short ways farther into the trees (3800 ft, 5:50. 6.5 miles).

I had a great ski off the summit down those beautiful glades to the road,  a
1000 foot run. I also  cut  the  clear-cut  switchback  for  a  little  more
downhill but by then the snow was getting a little wet and  heavy.  The  day
began as drizzle, graduating to snow flurries (and fog) as I got higher  but
it never amounted to much and I never got wet.  It  cleared  enough  in  the
afternoon for some distant views. The snow varied from  crust  to  start  to
nice new snow higher to wet slush for the  road  trip  down  but  was  quite
skiable all the time. I thought about staying on the main road all  the  way
to the car but it was getting late and the shorter direct route on the  spur
won out. For the most part it  was  reasonable  but  I  must  admit  it  was
challenging at times dodging obstacles and trying not to  get  skis  tangled
in brush. I did walk the very last bit.

If (when) I return to this area I would stick to the main  road  for  better
skiing. Hopefully I could drive farther and get closer to  the  good  stuff.
And there is plenty of good stuff higher up below Cornell Mtn.

Slide Mtn (4884 ft - P204 - Canyon Lake Quad) and  Jockey  Mtn  (4905  ft  -
P785 - Groat Mtn Quad) - March 17-18, 2011

Slide Mtn is a long gentle ridge west and  south  of  the  town  of  Glacier
between the North Fork Nooksack River  and  Racehorse  Creek.  The  area  is
riddled with logging roads one of which follows most of the  length  of  the
ridge and makes for very pleasant skiing. It is a bit too  long  for  a  day
trip this time of year but made for an easy 2 days with a camp near a  small
unnamed lake ("Slide Lake"?).

Thursday, March 17 - I took the North Fork Road off Mosquito Lake Road  some
5.5 miles to the turnoff up Racehorse Creek then left at another .7 mile  on
the road up Slide Mtn which I drove to the snowline  at  2  miles  and  2000
feet. I skied this road 5.5 miles to a lovely  campsite  on  a  bench  above
Slide Lake that had a nice view of Church Mtn, elev  4200  ft  (2200  ft,  5
hrs). I had plenty of time to set up camp, ski to the little lake  and  part
way farther up the road while watching the almost full moon rise before  the
sun set. The day had started sunny and warm but  once  shade  hit,  anything
that had melted soon froze  to  either  a  breakable  or  solid  crust.  The
temperature dropped to 19 degrees overnight.

Total for the day: 7 miles and 2500 ft

Friday, March 18 - I was underway before 7:00 and watched the sun rise as  I
warmed up. Once past my track set the night before  I  simply  continued  on
the road. I ran into some very hard crust  on  any  previously  sun  exposed
slopes. Shaded slopes were still powder. Because  of  this  I  bypassed  the
summit of Slide on the way in so I could ski down the north side on the  way
out. I also left the road at the saddle with Pt 4844 to traverse  the  north
slope of Pt 4844 and avoid the icy south side. I reached the flat summit  of
Jockey Mtn at 9:40. On the return I stayed on the ridge all the way  to  the
summit of Slide arriving at 11:00. I had a marvelous though short  ski  down
the north side in perfect powder to intercept my tracks on  the  road  below
before returning to camp at noon (6.5 mile, 2000 ft, 5 hrs)

Views had been quite good all day although Baker never made it  out  of  the
clouds. But I could now see  weather  approaching  from  the  south.   So  I
quickly packed up and left, reaching the  car  in  less  than  2  hours  and
encountering nary a drop of precipitation. I ran  into  heavy  rain  on  the
drive home.

Trip total: 19 miles and 4500 ft in 2 days

Toboggan Mtn (5004 ft - P1164 - Canyon Lk Quad) - Wednesday, March 23, 2011

What a beautiful day this turned out to be, warm  and  sunny  with  stunning
views in all directions. The skiing wasn\'t too shabby  either.  I  used  the
same approach as last week for Slide Mtn, this time staying right  with  the
road up Racehorse Cr for 4 miles until stopped by snow at 2300 ft  (about  1
mile before the spur  that  crosses  Racehorse  Cr).  I  could  have  driven
farther but the snow was icy and slick and I didn\'t  want  to  risk  it.  In
fact another vehicle had driven about half a mile more before parking.  From
there I followed the tracks of 3 skiers catching up  to  them  at  Racehorse
Saddle (4.5 miles, 2400 ft, 2:45 hrs). I was really surprised  to  run  into
other people as this is not a high use area,  especially  during  the  week,
and I half expected (hoped) them to be fellow peakbaggers known to me.  What
a kick that would have been! But alas, they were strangers  from  Bellingham
just out for some BC skiing. They were not going for Toboggan  and  in  fact
weren\'t even aware of that peak. After leaving the saddle I never  saw  them
again.

From the saddle I traversed around Racehorse Mtn to the next saddle but  ran
into some unexpectedly steep slopes that were  fully  exposed  to  the  sun,
softening and that began triggering concern for setting  off  avalanches.  I
declined to cross and had to climb quite a bit to get above them. Once  past
Racehorse I entered trees to get around the next  bump,  came  to  the  wide
open ridge to the false summit of Toboggan  and  skied  through  trees  once
again to the true summit (6 miles, 3100 ft, 4:15 hrs). I went  back  to  the
false summit with its expansive views for lunch.

After lunch I followed the crest of the ridge all the way to Racehorse  Mtn.
Just before the Relay Station I came to a short narrow  rocky  section  that
required removing skis and kicking steps. Then it was on to  the  flat  open
summit with more lovely views before skiing down  to  Racehorse  Saddle.  It
was all so nice and the day so gorgeous I extended it by  skiing  up  to  Pt
4760 to the north of the saddle. This allowed me to ski down the north  side
on preserved powder for a fantastic 800 ft drop until  I  hit  the  road.  I
then had a fast run down the rest of the road on icing snow that  thankfully
softened a bit as I got lower. I did a lot of  snowplowing.  I  reached  the
car at 6:20 to end a marvelous trip.

Total: 13 miles, 3900 ft and 8 hrs

Porter Peak (4760+ ft - P520 - Canyon Lk Quad) - Friday, April 8, 2011

This is another of the small peaks in the heavily logged  area  between  the
North and Middle Fork Nooksack Rivers on  the  outskirts  of  the  Mt  Baker
Wilderness that I have been accessing on skis  this  snow  season.  I  could
drive the Clearwater Road (off the Middle Fork Nooksack River Road)  only  2
miles before being halted by a fresh slide across the road  at  2000  ft.  I
would say it happened within the last week. So I walked the road .6 mile  to
the first spur left where there was then enough snow to ski.  This  spur  is
bermed and abandoned at a creek .5 mile farther but is skiable all  the  way
to its end at 4200 ft (3 miles, 2200, 2:45 hrs) The going was quite good  to
this point - then it all fell apart.  The  road  ended  on  a  steep  wooded
hillside with trees really too close together for skis  and  snow  too  deep
and wet and slushy for postholing. I was forced to  slowly  struggle  upward
on my skis. Okay, I admit snowshoes would have been  better  here  but  even
they would have required a mighty effort. This short  section  of  300  feet
and .2 mile to the ridge line  took  a  full  hour.  I  was  coming  to  the
realization that either I wouldn\'t make Porter Peak or it was going to be  a
very long day.

Once on the ridge the going was better. However, I now had a view of  Porter
and it was still a long ways off. I continued along the ridge to the  summit
of Pt 4758 (3000 ft, 4:15 hrs)  thinking this  may  well  end  up  being  my
destination for the day. But from  the  summit  inviting  terrain  led  down
toward the saddle with Porter. So on I went. I actually  had  a  nice  short
run on reasonable snow before once  again  running  into  some  thick  trees
prior to hitting a road at the saddle coming up from Porter Creek. From  the
saddle it got worse again but I wasn\'t going to  quit  now.  A  steep  step,
more thick trees, lots of ups and downs and  terrible  snow  conditions  all
melting in the warm sun.  It was hard believe the snow could be so  wet  and
heavy  and  unconsolidated  so  late  in  the  season.   Trailbreaking   was
exhausting. I finally arrived at the wooded summit at 5:00 (5.5  mile,  3800
ft, 6:45 hrs).

The trip out was a blur of very  cautious  survival  skiing  on  alternating
trapping deep slush, freezing crust and breakable  crust  depending  on  sun
exposure and time in the shade. I tried a more  direct  route  bypassing  Pt
4758 but in the end determined it was easier to go back up over the  top.  I
reached the road just at dark. Of course by this time the snow had  refrozen
completely but in comparison to what I had previously come  down  it  was  a
vast improvement. I reached the car at 10:30 totally done in. Not one of  my
better ski outings. At least the views were nice.

Total: 11 miles, 4500 ft and 12:15 hrs

"Skate-Berry Pk" (4880+ ft - P600 ft - Waypenayo Pk Quad) - April 22, 2011

This peak between Berry and Skate Creeks south of Ashford is a  long  mostly
road ski. It was almost too long for a day trip but I needed something  long
and mindless after being out of town on personal business for  well  over  a
week. Mountains and exercise always help me put things in perspective.

I did follow the weather while I was gone and so was aware  that  conditions
had continued cool and wet. Still I was astonished  that  I  couldn\'t  drive
farther than a mile on Big Creek Road 84 to 2200 ft.  I  had  hoped  to  get
much farther. Will winter ever end? Oh well I did say I wanted a  long  trip
didn\'t I? Skiing was quite pleasant on the gentle road with  the  snow  firm
and well packed from old snowmobile  tracks.  None  of  the  machines  today
though. I stayed left at the junction with 8440 to Towhead Gap at  6  miles,
dropped slightly to cross Berry Creek, and then climbed  again  to  a  minor
spur 1.75 miles farther. The day was sunny and warm with  many  varied  views
of Mt Rainier.

The rough spur ended in a clear-cut where I soon entered trees with  limited
views. The last 900 ft from the end of the spur was slow going  in  the  now
wet unconsolidated snow. I removed  skis  and  kicked  steps  up  the  final
steepish 300 feet to the wooded summit arriving at 4:00 (10 miles, 2900  ft,
6 hrs).

The return trip took 3.5 hours, helped on the lower flat road  by  the  fact
that it was in the shade and icing over which speeded things up and  allowed
me to make the car well before dark.

Total: 20 miles, 3000 ft and 9:30 hrs

Tuesday, April 26: Timberwolf Mtn - With unsettled weathered west I  decided
to head east and hope for something better.  My plan  worked.  Despite  much
fresh snow over White Pass the roads were clear and by the  time  I  reached
the Bethel Ridge Road I was in sunshine and able to drive to 4600  ft,  much
higher than expected.  Sunshine persisted for the most part as I  skied  the
road 4 miles to a lovely camp in Cash Prairie at  6000  ft  (1400  ft,  2:30
hr).

I had reached my intended campsite early enough  I  thought  I  could  still
make Timberwolf Mtn this day. I took a  shortcut  straight  down  from  Cash
Prairie to intersect the road to Timberwolf at 5300 ft. Although  mostly  in
woods, small glades with nice snow offered some good downhill.  Once on  the
road  I  followed  it,  cutting  one  large  switchback,  to  meadows  below
Timberwolf. Weather was still reasonable but sun  now  came  and  went  with
some light snow showers. Views west were clouding up. Near the summit  ridge
I lost the road. In fact I could hardly  believe  a  road  went  along  this
ridge. Large cornices obliterated it  completely.  The  final  Â¼  mile  went
slowly as I threaded my way over and between the cornices  but  I  was  able
the ski the entire distance. A sign incongruously sticking out of  the  snow
proclaimed the summit and identified surrounding peaks (5.5 miles, 1500  ft,
3 hrs). Can you really drive to this point in the summer? For a peak with  a
road to the top Timberwolf was surprisingly interesting and challenging.

The return took just as long. I stuck to the road as any snow previously  in
the sun had crusted over and made for  tricky  skiing.  The  road  was  more
consistent. As soon as possible at an open drainage I left the road for  the
climb back to Cash Prairie. I might have done better to stick  to  the  road
the whole way even though it would have added well over a mile as  the  snow
was too icy for skis and yet I broke through the crust on foot. I  struggled
slowly upward for several hundred feet until hitting more gentle  woods  and
better snow where I could ski again. I reached  camp  at  10:30  (11  miles,
2500 ft, 6:30 hr RT).

Wednesday,  April  27:  Burnt  Mtn  and  Shellrock  Pk  -  With  a   morning
temperature of 21 degrees and after  my  experience  with  crusty  snow  the
night before I didn\'t hold out much hope for great off  road  skiing  today,
as least until the day warmed up. Starting at 7:30 I skied the road  to  its
end at the boundary with the William O. Douglas Wilderness. I dropped a  bit
and traversed the north side below cornices and  cliffs  to  a  small  basin
where I could gain the ridge to the south side. Here I ran into snow so  icy
I had to remove skis. I decided to leave them  and  proceed  on  foot  as  I
didn\'t think skiing would improve that  much.  I  descended  a  short  steep
section then followed the ridge to a low  point  before  entering  woods  to
climb to Burnt Mtn. Of course I ran into some deep powder where I  wished  I
had my skis but that didn\'t last. Overall, the effort of carrying  skis  and
putting them on and off was not worth it. It was more efficient to walk.  So
I toughed it out postholing deeply in places and making slow progress.

I reached Burnt Mtn at 10:30 (3 miles, 1150 ft, 3 hrs). I  still  thought  I
could make Shellrock despite my slow pace as I had all  day.  Good  thing  I
had all day as I sure needed it. Shellrock was farther than it  looked  with
an 800 ft drop and much meandering along the ridge. But the route was  quite
interesting and the final  open  corniced  summit  ridge  stunning.  I  sure
wouldn\'t want to be on this ridge in bad weather. There is  zero  protection
from the wind and it would be easy to get disoriented in fog. In fact I  did
enter fog the last hundred feet  or  so  and  had  to  carefully  follow  my
footsteps to head down the right direction and not  go  over  a  cornice.  I
reached the summit at 1:30 (5.5 miles, 2250 ft, 6 hrs).

The return was slow and an effort. Combined with my strenuous day  before  I
was running out of energy. I did have a nice run  though  once  back  to  my
skis and pulled into camp at 6:30. I still had time to go out that day.  But
just as I reached the shelter of my tent the weather deteriorated with  wind
and heavy snow and I wisely decided to hunkered down for the night.

Total: 11 miles, 3900 ft and 11 hrs

Thursday, April 28 - It stormed all night long  with  wind  and  snow.  Some
wind gusts had to be in excess of 60 mph but I was snug  and  secure  in  my
bombproof Hilleberg tent. I kept thinking I was glad I wasn\'t  on  Shellrock
under such conditions. I prepared myself for unpleasant packing  up  in  the
morning but I awakened to sun on the tent and very little  wind.  It  was  a
beautiful morning and I had a very enjoyable run down to the  car  on  fresh
snow for a lovely end to a very interesting trip (4 miles, 1:30 hrs).

Trip Total: 30 miles and 7750 ft in 3 days

Divide Ridge is a long (over 15 miles) high ridge east  of  White  Pass  and
south of Rimrock Lake and the Tieton River.  There are 4 peaks either  named
or of prominence along its length all of  which  I  hoped  to  ski.  I  also
planned to climb on foot two smaller bonus peaks accessed  along  the  drive
to the snowline.

Tuesday, May 3: Pks 4128 and 3737 - Pk 4128 turned  out  to  be  a  pleasant
little  scramble  up  open  woods  to  a  cute  flat  summit  rimmed  by  an
interesting columnar basalt wall with good views to Rimrock  Lake  (1  mile,
1000 ft, 1:25 hr RT). Pk 3737 was an even shorter scramble along a  steepish
ridge to a nice viewpoint of Divide Ridge (.6 miles, 530 ft,:35 hrs RT).

From the road in the saddle below Pk 3737 I continued driving until  stopped
by snow at 3900 ft. I needed the 4 wheel drive on my Jeep to  punch  through
several snow patches but still didn\'t get  as  high  as  I  had  hoped.  The
previous week I had been able to drive to 4700 ft on the Bethel Ridge  Road,
the difference, I guess, between a northern and a southern exposure.

I began skiing the road at 2:45. I thought I had plenty of time  to  get  to
my planned campsite at the saddle on Divide Ridge below Dome Peak.  My  maps
showed "roads" all the way. I should have paid more  attention  to  Stefan\'s
recent report of Dome. He did not recommend skiing this route. I soon  found
out why. The upper roads are not really roads at all but  narrow  steep  4WD
trails that are difficult to follow in the snow and not really suitable  for
skis. I lost my way,  got  on  the  wrong  trail  and  ended  up  traversing
difficult forest to get back on track. The terrain eventually opened up  and
skiing improved in the basin below the saddle but that was after  struggling
for several hours. The last bit over the rim was steep and rocky and  I  had
to remove skis. I couldn\'t see how any semblance of a  "road"  could  go  up
through here, despite one shown on the map.  I  began  regretting  the  time
spent on my 2 bonus peaks but I did make  the  lovely  flat  meadow  in  the
saddle (elev 5800 ft) just in time to set up  camp  in  daylight  (5  miles,
2300 ft, 4:30 hrs).

Wednesday, May 4: Dome Pk, Stroback Mtn and Divide Ridge  E  Pk  -  The  day
dawned sunny, the snow crusty to start but  soon  softening.   This  is  the
first overnight trip this year I  didn\'t  need  toe  warmers  in  my  boots.
Skiing was wonderful up open slopes to Dome Peak and I  reached  the  summit
at 9:00 (1 mile, 800 ft, 1:00). I  continued  along  the  delightful  ridge,
with views constantly dueling between  Mt  Adams  and  Mt  Rainier  and  the
Tieton Valley, to Strobach Mtn (4 miles, 1150 ft, 3 hrs).

Once past Strobach the skiing quality deteriorated rapidly. I had some  good
stuff along the open ridge but soon entered forest and began a drop of  1600
ft to Louie Way Gap at 4800 ft. A traverse around Pt 5360 where  I  couldn\'t
see where I was going followed. I found no evidence of any useful trails.  I
had to leave  skis  for  the  last  bit  as  the  final  south  slopes  were
completely melted out and bare rock.  I  climbed  to  the  rocky  rim  at  a
distinctive memorial cross and continued from there across the flat  plateau
to the summit at 3:30 (9 miles, 2300 ft, 7:30 hrs).  By  now  it  was  quite
windy and I ate lunch in a sheltered spot below Jump BM just off the rim.

The return took just as long. Whatever possessed  me  to  come  this  far???
Sometimes I just don\'t know when to quit.  I tried  to  contour  around  the
summits but it didn\'t help that much. It goes without saying  I  was  caught
by darkness and the soft snow crusted over. But it  was  a  beautiful  night
and I was dazzled by the lights of Yakima. I reached my camp  at  11:00  too
tired to do much more than have a  cup  of  tea  and  a  quick  bite  before
falling into a deep sleep (18 miles, 4600 ft, 15 hrs).

Thursday, May 5: Divide Ridge W Pk - This  day  started  cloudy  with  light
sprinkles, threatening more than it ever  produced.  I  started  for  Divide
Ridge W Pk at 8:00. I actually found the sign in the saddle marking the  4WD
trail going to Strobach Spring but I immediately lost the  way.  I  wandered
through the forest and  ended  up  climbing  to  the  ridge  directly  above
instead of traversing as the trail did. Once on the  broad  flat  ridge  the
skiing was very nice but it was windy and getting windier.  I  followed  the
ridge to the open summit (3 miles, 1300 ft, 2 hrs). It was foggy and  I  had
no views. I returned to camp on a traverse below  the  ridge  to  avoid  the
increasing wind (6 miles, 1400 ft, 4 hrs).

Although windy the sun was making an appearance and I took a welcome nap  in
the warm tent until awakened by a gust so strong it tore all the stakes  out
of my tent (12" snow stakes). I have no doubt had I not  been  in  the  tent
and anchoring it with my weight my tent and  all  its  contents  would  have
been blown across the meadow. I took that as a sign  to  leave.   Once  down
from the windy saddle skiing was quite good. The sun was shining,  the  snow
soft and at times it was downright hot. I did a better job  of  finding  the
4WD trail below the open basin which led to a real, though  annoyingly  flat
and even up at times, road and back to my car (5 miles, 200 ft, 2:40 hrs).

Trip Total: 34 miles and 8600 ft in 3 days (not counting bonus peaks)

Butte Quad - May 9-11, 2011

My main goal for this trip was  Klicton  Divide  (with  its  two  prominence
points of Darland Mtn and Spencer Pt) on the edge of the Goat Rocks and  the
Yakima Indian Reservation. Divide Ridge (where I was last week)  turns  into
Klicton Divide at Darland Mtn. On the drive in I picked up  two  more  bonus
peaks above Clear Lake.

Monday, May 9: Pk 3920 and Kamiakin Butte - I accessed Pk 3920 via  a  short
road on the north off Hwy 12 just  before  Tieton  Road  and  drove  to  the
saddle with Pt 3606. An easy hike up a continuing  rough  track  then  trail
then open woods led past a pond full of croaking frogs to the  open  summit.
I had a taste of things to come with an enticing partial view  of  the  Goat
Rocks (1.5 miles, 640 ft, 1:15 hrs RT).  I started for rocky Kamiakin  Butte
from the entrance to Camp Dudley skirting cliffs until I could  scramble  up
the NE slope (.75 miles, 450 ft, :45 hrs RT). Both these little  peaks  were
more fun than their diminutive size might indicate and it was nice  to  hike
on bare ground.

Disaster: After climbing these two  bonus  peaks  I  drove  the  South  Fork
Tieton River Road 1000 where I hoped to get close to Conrad Meadows at  4000
ft. Those hopes were soon dashed when I began running into significant  snow
at 3300 ft with about 7 miles still to go.  I  kept  punching  through  snow
patches interspersed between bare stretches until finally my  jeep  wouldn\'t
go anymore at 3600 ft, 4 miles still to go. This is  when  my  trip  took  a
disastrous turn and almost ended for good. While backing  up  to  get  to  a
bare spot I lost concentration for a moment, got out of the track and  slide
into the soft snow on the side. I was  stuck.  Man  was  I  ever  stuck!  In
surveying the situation I saw that I was high  centered  with  my  two  left
wheels on the packed track and my two right wheels in  deep  slush  with  no
traction whatsoever. There was no way I was going anywhere,  either  forward
or backward until I could get off the high center. Do you know how  hard  it
is to dig out snow from under the center of a vehicle? I will spare you  the
gruesome details but it is not easy. Especially for  this  little  old  lady
alone. I would have gladly accepted  help  from  any  redneck  who  happened
along. But alas, no one came by. In fact no one came  by  the  entire  three
days I was parked there.  I really thought I might have to swallow my  pride
and either hike out or climb up to cell  phone  reception  and  call  a  tow
truck. But I stubbornly kept digging and hacking away at the snow,  put  the
chains on and after 3 hours of strenuous work I was free.

The question was what to do now? It was 5:00. I still had a good 3.5  hours
of daylight and I could get several miles up the road but not  all  the  way
to my desired camp. However I was tired and demoralized  and  all  wet  from
lying in the snow (I had a change of clothes in the car but  they  were  not
climbing clothes). So I decided to car camp where I was, dry out  and  start
early the next morning rested and refreshed.

Tuesday, May 10: Spencer Pt - I was up and going  by  7:00  and  in  a  much
better mood. I walked/ skied the uninteresting flat road 3.5 miles  to  Road
1070, Â½ mile before Conrad Meadow. Thank heavens for iPods or I  would  have
been bored  silly.  There  were  long  stretches  of  bare  road  that  made
continuous skiing impossible but it will still be several weeks  before  the
road is completely melted out to Conrad Meadows. After  crossing  the  South
Fork Tieton River, Rd 1070 was skiable all the way to  "Diamond  Saddle"  at
5350 ft where I set up camp (8 miles, 2000 ft, 5 hrs).

I decided to go for the more scenic south end of Klicton Divide and  Spencer
Point on this beautiful warm sunny  day  as  the  weather  was  supposed  to
change for the worse tomorrow. I set out at 1:30. It was so warm I  stripped
down to my long johns and shirt sleeves. I am thinking it is  time  to  make
the switch to warmer weather gear next trip. I skied along  the  edge  of  a
clear-cut, then traversed woods until I could make a  steep  ascent  to  the
ridge below Pt 6490. This steep section was the only place I  needed  skins.
Once on the ridge skiing was easy and the terrain opened  up  as  I  rounded
the point. Views were gorgeous. I tried to stay on the ridge but ran into  a
rocky pinnacle that I turned on the south side. Back on the ridge past  this
I was directly across from  the  heart  of  the  southern  Goat  Rocks.  All
memories of my previous difficulties were erased. The  final  ridge  to  the
summit was glorious (4.5 miles, 1680 ft, 3:20 hrs).

I was oh so very tempted to continue along Klicton Divide,  which  goes  all
the way to Mt Curtis Gilbert. It looked delicious. But I controlled  myself,
learning from my last trip not to go too far. I really wanted  to  get  back
to camp before dark and before the snow crusted over and made  for  horrible
skiing. And because of this I  had  a  wonderful  ski  back.  The  snow  was
perfect spring snow. I reached camp with the sun still shining on  the  tent
at 7:45 (9 miles, 2050 ft, 6:15 hrs).

Total for the day: 17 miles, 4050 ft, 11:15 hrs

Wednesday, May 11: Darland Mtn and Coyote Rocks - I got an  early  start  at
6:45 as I wanted to beat the weather. The day started cloudy with a few  sun
breaks at times and although it didn\'t freeze during the night the snow  was
crusty and I needed full skins. I followed the gentle ridge north.  Most  of
the way was open or through burned forest. It was very pleasant  travel.  At
Narrowneck Gap the final rise to Darland steepened  and  the  snow  had  not
softened yet so it was an effort to ski up the slick crust. The flat  summit
plateau was very expansive, the highest point marked by  a  cell  tower  and
flag (4 miles, 1860 ft, 2:45 hrs).

By the time I left the snow had softened enough  that  I  was  able  to  ski
(rather than boot) down to Narrowneck Gap. From there I could  see  that  it
would be good skiing to  Coyote  Rocks  and  since  the  weather  was  still
holding I decided to add the extra 1.5  mile side trip to  my  itinerary.  I
am glad I did. Coyote Rocks was a delight and to my mind had a nicer  summit
than Darland (6 miles, 2020 ft, 4:25 hrs). I had a lovely ski back  to  camp
arriving at 12:55 (9 miles, 2240 ft, 6:10 hrs).

I could tell the rain wouldn\'t hold off for much  longer  so  I  immediately
packed up to leave at 1:40 for the trip out. The ski  down  Road  1070  went
well, but Road 1000 was an absolute pain. I skied what I could  but  I  lost
count after a dozen of the times I had to take my skis off for bare  ground.
But I did beat the rain (8 miles, 150 ft,  3  hrs).  It  rained  the  entire
drive home.

Trip total: 34 miles and 6450 ft in 2 days

Mt Church (4780 ft - P1180 - Mt Tebo Quad) - Friday, May 11, 2011

I wanted good weather for this little peak which I knew would  require  some
rock work. I drove FR 23 and  2361  up  the  South  Fork  Skokomish  to  the
junction with 2363. I had hoped to drive this road to the snowline  and  ski
to its end. The 4th edition Olympic Mountain Climber\'s Guide (2006) has  the
road drivable for 5 miles. It is  no  more.  It  is  blocked  right  at  the
junction with 2361 and is now ditched and decommissioned. And I mean  REALLY
DECOMMISSIONED. There are  deep  ditches  every  100  feet  for  its  entire
length. I fail to understand why old roads  are  ditched  and  why  this  is
better for the environment then just letting them revert  slowly  to  nature
and make a pleasant hiking path. Please, someone  explain  to  me  how  huge
ditches that disturb the soil are good for anything.  They certainly  render
the road completely useless for skiing and biking not to mention  making  it
a real pain to even hike. Sure, put in 4  or  5  ditches  at  the  start  to
prevent vehicular traffic. But I hiked this road for over  2  miles  with  a
ditch every 100 feet. Do the math. That adds up to about 100 ditches.

After 2 miles on the road I grew weary of the ditches  and  as  soon  as  it
seemed feasible headed uphill to cut the switchbacks. The first part was  in
unpleasant thick second growth but as the snow  got  deeper  and  the  trees
thinner travel became easier. At the end of the upper  road  I  entered  old
forest, which though steep, was very pleasant going. I stayed just  left  of
the SE rib and any rocky outcrops. The rib gentled about  4000  ft  where  I
began heading right toward the col in the south ridge. Snow was not too  bad
for step kicking and I sank in about ankle deep.

I went all the way to the col but once there could  not  find  an  easy  way
onto the ridge. I dinked around for half an hour trying  to  find  a  direct
route up on damp holdless rock before deciding that wouldn\'t work for me.  I
thought I might have to drop way below the summit  rocks  and  work  my  way
around to the right on nasty looking  steep  snow  when  I  spied  a  hidden
chimney behind a tree slightly down from the col. I squirmed  up  this  into
more trees where I came across a rappel sling  with  a  rap  ring  attached.
This assured me I was on someone\'s route. But I was not happy that they  had
considered it necessary to rappel. I was even less happy when I  popped  out
of the trees and got a good look at  the  ridge.  Good  grief  -  it  looked
rather daunting. The climber\'s guide rates this peak as class 3. But I  know
by now it always underrates climbs so expected some class 4. I  did  have  a
rope along but didn\'t really want to use it.

The ridge was not as bad as it first looked - mostly  class  3  with  a  few
class 4 moves here and there. But it was exposed and longer than expected  -
several ropes  lengths  -  with  many  ups  and  downs  to  get  past  small
pinnacles. One of the worst spots for me was just below the summit  where  I
had to cross a short exposed snow patch without my axe (I  had  left  it  at
the chimney). I found a large summit register on top but it was so soggy  as
to be useless so I left a new one. I spent about 30 minutes  on  top  trying
to identify distant peaks and not being very successful at it.

It took about as long to downclimb the ridge as to climb it  but  I  managed
without any rappels. It was fast down the snow although  I  sank  in  a  lot
deeper, over my calf in places. The whole road thing  and  rocky  ridge  had
taken longer than expected but I planned to car camp that night  so  was  in
no great hurry. In keeping with my usual MO I did the last of  the  road  by
headlamp.

Time up: 5:45 hrs - Time down: 2:30 hrs - Total: 7 miles, 3800 ft  and  8:45
hrs

Saturday, May 12 - After a car camp, the next day  I  hiked  up  Dusk  Point
(3241 ft - P481 - Mt Tebo Quad)  and Pk 2321 (P561  -  Mt  Tebo  Quad).  The
road up Pk 2321 has also been decommissioned so I went straight  up  the  NW
slope. Steep but not too bad (.5 miles, 575 ft, 1:10 hr RT). I was  able  to
drive the road up Dusk Point to 2500 ft before being stopped by  snow.  From
there I gained the S ridge to hit the road high up. From  the  looks  of  it
(trees growing in the middle) I would say the road  is  no  longer  drivable
all the way to the top even when the snow is gone. But  at  least  it  isn\'t
ditched. The open top is a nice viewpoint where I got  a  good  look  at  my
route up Church (1.5 miles, 685 ft, 1:45 RT).

Tuesday, May 24 - This was to be the only good  weather  day  of  the  week.
Wednesday looked wet. So how to make the most of my one good day?

Chimney Peaks - I have passed by Chimney Peaks several  times on the way  to
Kloochman Rock and often seen them from afar. They looked intriguing  and  I
always wanted to climb them. I needed dry rock though  so  thought  I  could
fit them in today before the main event of Ironstone rather  than  after  on
tomorrow when I would have more time but  also  most  likely  rain.  In  the
interest of saving time I had planned to climb only the highest peak  but  I
found the scrambling so much fun on fascinating horizontal  columnar  basalt
that I continued on the ridge going over every bump (7 or 8  depending  upon
what you count) along the way (1.2 miles, 1130 ft, 2:10 hrs RT).

Ironstone Pk and Russell Ridge - I drove the  road  up  the  south  side  of
Wildcat Cr where I ran into many woodcutters, some commercial that  appeared
to be thinning small trees and  some  private  that  looked  to  be  cutting
firewood. I was stopped by snow .2 miles before the road  end  at  4260  ft.
This road does not go to the official Wildcat TH but did get me  higher  and
farther. I started at 2:50. There is no connector path that I found  but  it
was easy to find a way through minimal brush and across a log  over  Wildcat
Cr to the main trail. The first part was mostly snow free to the  William  O
Douglas Wilderness boundary. Would you believe that the signpost  there  was
already (or maybe still) stocked with permits? I dutifully  filled  one  out
although I saw no signs of anyone having been this way, did  not  expect  to
see anyone and in fact did not see anyone.

Past the Wilderness boundary I  quickly  began  running  into  snow.  I  was
travelling light. I was done with hard core winter camping  for  this  year.
I had a 3 season tent, lighter sleeping bag, no snow stakes  and  no  shovel
so I really wanted to camp on bare ground. I  figured  my  best  chance  was
away from the valley floor on an open higher  bench  fully  exposed  to  the
sun. I headed uphill in search of such a place and indeed did  find  one  on
relatively dry gravel (all meadows were soggy wet) at  5360  ft.  (3  miles,
1200 ft 2:10 hrs). Running water was everywhere. No more  melting  snow  for
water either.

It took an hour to set up camp. I started for Ironstone  at  6:00.  I  would
have preferred to lounge around in the warm sun but I  knew  tomorrow  would
be wet. It was not far to  Ironstone  and  despite  spending  more  time  on
Chimney Peaks than I had planned, I still thought I had time to make it  and
Russell Ridge before dark. If not, there was always the headlamp. I did  not
bring snowshoes but did bring an ice axe. I didn\'t  need  either.  The  snow
was soft but consolidated enough for good walking. I only broke through  the
occasional rotten spot. I headed for the NE ridge of Ironstone. Once on  the
ridge I came across very fresh mountain goat tracks. Just below  the  summit
I startled the track maker and he took off running across the snow.  I  just
managed to get my camera out and take a photo  before  be  disappeared  from
sight.

The summit was melted out (1050 ft,  1  hr).  I  found  a  large  PVC   tube
register but it was empty  except  for  one  soggy  scrap  of  paper.  I  am
continually amazed that someone will carry a huge register  container  to  a
summit only to skimp on the quality of the paper register inside.  I  repeat
again that a register must be made of WATERPROOF paper to be of any use  and
remain legible when wet (and they all get wet eventually). Had I known  such
a container was on top I would have  brought  one  of  my  large  waterproof
booklets to put inside. As it was I only had a small register with me  so  I
just stuck the whole thing inside the larger one.

I quickly descended to Fox Meadow and started up Russell Ridge. The way  was
mostly wooded but I had a partial view of Ironstone shining  bright  red  in
the late afternoon sun clearly showing why it is so named. I made  the  high
point at 8:20, quickly returned to Fox meadow and traversed below  Ironstone
back to camp at 9:30 (4 miles, 1750 ft, 3:30 hr RT). I did use  my  headlamp
the last bit.

Wednesday, May 25  -  I  awoke  to  clouds  with  rain  not  far  behind.  I
thankfully packed up while it was still dry, the rain  starting  just  as  I
left at 8:00. It rained steadily the whole 2 hours going out  and  the  rest
of the day.

Pk 4480+ - I saved this prominence peak  for the drive out as I  figured  it
could be done in the rain. Again woodcutters were busy in the area. In  fact
I had to squeeze past parked vehicles and  move  some  debris  left  in  the
roadway in one place. In another a guy was parked right  in  the  middle  of
the road and I could not get by. He was starting his chainsaw so  I  had  to
honk to get his attention. He cheerfully moved his truck. I don\'t  think  he
expected anyone to come by. I get that a lot. I drove road spurs to the  end
on the SE side of the peak and hiked pleasant open terrain to the  cute  top
marked by a cairn. Views would be nice on a clear day but I saw  nothing  in
the fog(1 mile, 530 ft, :50 hr RT).

Since it was so close I also hiked up Westfall Rocks. It was only  .4  mile,
100 ft and :15 hr RT. It too would be a nice viewpoint.  In  fact  I  had  a
fairly nice close view through the rain of  Rimrock  Lake,  Tieton  Dam  and
straight down to Hwy 12 but I hadn\'t bothered to bring a camera.

Bearcat Peak (7960+ at least - P640 - Lucerne Quad) and Peak  7942  (P662  -
Pinnacle Mtn Quad) - June 8-11, 2011

Wednesday, June 8 - This trip had been scheduled to start on Tuesday  but  I
lobbied Mike successfully to have it  pushed  to  Wednesday.  I  desperately
needed another day to recover after being hit by a small snow block  on  Big
Four the previous Sunday and tumbling downhill fifty feet or  so.  I  wasn\'t
sure even then I would be able to make it but  the  damage  to  my  leg  was
temporary and not as bad as I first thought. It ended up  not  hindering  me
at all.

I met Roy and Mike at Field\'s Point for the boat ride to Lucerne.  I  wanted
to be completely independent just in case I had to retreat  early.  That  is
where I discovered I had forgotten my camera. I would have to rely  on  Mike
taking pictures. We began hiking the trail to Emerald Park  at  12:10  under
sunny skies. Once past the Domke Lake junction, the trail went most  of  the
way through burned forest. It was in good shape with only mild brush  and  a
few small logs to cross. It was completely snow  free  to  about  4500  feet
except for some avalanche snow in gullies. By the time we made camp  at  the
first reasonable place at 4900 ft  snow  was  continuous  and  several  feet
deep. We were still about 1 mile from Emerald Park. Roy found a  small  bare
patch that accommodated his tiny tent while Mike  and  I  leveled  spots  on
snow just as it began to rain lightly. It rained into the night.

Total: 6.5 miles, 3750 ft and 6:40 hr

Thursday, June 9: Peak 7942 -Mike and I got a leisurely start  at  7:45  for
our bonus peaks in warm sunshine. Roy stayed in  camp  and  rested  for  the
main event of Bearcat the next day. We decided to  go  for  the  farther  Pk
7942 first.  We wound our way through dense trees toward Emerald Park  until
we could head uphill to the 6700 ft  saddle  above  Mirror  Lake.  There  is
supposed to be a trail to here but we saw no sign of it. From the saddle  we
dropped 500 feet, traversed below cliffs to a lovely basin  NE  of  Pinnacle
Mtn before climbing to the south ridge of Pk 7942. There were many signs  of
recent avalanches. The terrain was  easy  but  the  snow  soft  and  getting
softer. Trail breaking was a chore and we  traded  off  frequently.  It  was
particularly bad the last bit along the ridge to the summit  where  we  were
sinking in to the knees or deeper.  Mike being heavier had a harder time  of
it than I. He would even often break through my tracks when I  was  leading.
There was evidence of maybe a foot or more  of  recent  new  snow  here.  We
reached the summit cairn (melted out) at 1:00 (3540 ft 5:15 hrs).

I found the most unusual register I  have  ever  seen  buried  deep  in  the
summit cairn - a single piece of paper inside  a  plastic  bag  and  wrapped
tightly in athletic tape. It took me over  5  minutes  to  unwrap  the  darn
thing. It had been placed by Mitch  Blanton  on  his  FA  in  2001  and  was
obviously not meant to be used by anyone else.  At  least  it  was  dry  and
still legible. I placed the paper inside one of my registers.

We now hoped to get Peak 7738. It was  easier  going  following  our  tracks
back to the 6700 ft saddle. From there we tried  to  follow  the  ridge  but
soon got stopped by pinnacles and a steep nasty sidehill of  snow  and  rock
below the false summit. With no rope, uncertain prospects and  time  running
out we mutually agree to turn around. We were back in  camp  by  7:00  where
Roy had a welcome fire going that helped to dry out wet pants and boots.

Total: 9 miles, 4750 ft and 11 hrs

Friday, June 10: Bearcat Pk - Today was the main event and what we  had  all
come for, the TOP 200 peak of Bearcat. We were on the go by 6:30 and in  the
basin of Emerald Park in an hour. At this point we  weren\'t  sure  where  to
go. All the available route descriptions were so vague or confusing that  we
weren\'t even sure which side to approach from. But Mike and  I  had  a  good
view from the previous day and decided on the NE ridge.  We  climbed  slopes
to below the NW  face then cut left  to  cross  the  north  ridge  into  the
beautiful NE basin where a steep gully led to a 7600  ft  notch  in  the  NE
ridge (2800 ft, 4 hrs).

Here is where it all fell apart. We had hoped for  easy  melted  out  ledges
traversing the south side to below the summit. What we found instead  was  a
series of steep ugly snow filled gullies between rocky ribs.  If  it  hadn\'t
been for Mike\'s optimism I would have thrown in the towel  then  and  there.
The whole traverse looked like a nightmare to me, and  it  wasn\'t  far  from
it. We took turns leading across the soft snow. The snow  was  topped  by  a
layer of several new inches that had to be removed before solid steps  could
be kicked. It was slough off the top layer, watch it slide downhill  out  of
sight, kick a step and  repeat.  Step,  slough,  step,  slough.  Slow,  slow
going. And all this on slopes so steep with no runout that if  you  lost  it
you were dead. I haven\'t been so freaked out since I climbed  Lincoln.  This
went on for hours, crossing gully after gully and  rib  after  rib.  I  lost
count how many. At one place Mike had to chop his  way  through  a  vertical
cornice to gain a rib. On another I had to step across a scary moat  onto  a
wet ledge with minimal handholds. And at the last rib we had  to  rappel  to
get off. Finally we were at the  gully  below  the  summit  and  could  head
uphill. As we were finishing the rappel a  spontaneous  slide  came  roaring
down this gully\'s runnel spilling over the cliffs below. I think  even  Mike
was shaken by that.

Fortunately we crossed the runnel without mishap and  climbed  ever  steeper
snow above to the summit ridge and then the summit at 3:45  (3500  ft,  9:15
hrs). We found no previous register although I know some were left.  I  hope
mine stays a while longer. We didn\'t linger long on top. The way  back  went
easier with a packed track and  known  route  but  we  took  it  slowly  and
carefully often going one at a time. We were able to  up  climb  the  rappel
but did a rappel at another especially tricky spot. We reached the notch  at
7:00 and camp just before 9:00. I was so tired I barely had  the  energy  to
down a bite of dinner before falling into bed.  Roy  didn\'t  even  make  his
trademark fire.

Total: 6 miles, 3700 ft and 14: 15 hrs

Saturday, June 11 - Roy did make a morning fire before  we  all  left  about
8:00 for the trek out, each at his own pace. We easily made  the  2:30  boat
(6.5 miles and 4:00 hrs).

Grand Total: - 28 miles and 12,200 ft in 4 days

I want to make a comment about Roy. This guy is amazing.  At  82  and  still
climbing peaks of this caliber. He puts us all to shame. I only hope  I  can
equal him when I am that age. My hat is off to "Amazing Roy".

Creek Butte (7670 ft - P190) - Gilbert Quad - June 16-18, 2011

Thursday, June 16 - The drive to the  Twisp  River  Valley  is  long  and  I
didn\'t get a particularly early start so it was 1:20 before I stared up  the
South Creek trail. No problem. All I  had  to  do  was  get  to  a  campsite
reasonably close to my peaks before dark and I figured I  still  had  plenty
of time for that. The trail  showed  little  signs  of  recent  use.  A  few
parties had signed the trail register listing either Louis  Lake  or  "none"
as their destination. I doubt those headed for Louis Lake made it  as  South
Creek was a raging torrent and  would  be  difficult  to  cross.  I  luckily
didn\'t have to cross any major creeks.

The trail was snow free to where I left it at 4400 ft (3.5 miles,  1200  ft,
2:20 hrs), just past an inviting meadow and just before  crossing  the  side
creek draining Crescent Basin. It was tempting to  camp  there  but  it  was
only 3:40 and much too early to stop. I headed uphill in  open  woods  on  a
rib paralleling the creek. The going was very nice from the start with  very
little brush and it got even better when I ran into a way trail. This  trail
had the look of an old built trail with switchbacks in places. As the  slope
steepened so did the trail and it became crisscrossed  with  various  animal
trails but for the most part it was easily followed. I sure didn\'t expect  a
trail. Was it an old miner\'s trail (many mines in this  area)  or  was  this
the way to the old lookout on South Creek Butte?

At 5:30 and 5760 ft the rib flattened with snow beginning. I could see  that
from here on snow would be continuous and I really didn\'t want  to  camp  on
snow again so began looking for a site. I found a lovely flat spot  on  bare
ground with a tiny babbling brook nearby for water. Perfect.

Day total: 4.5 miles, 2500 ft, 4:10 hrs

Friday, June 17 - Since I had turned in at 8:30 the night before  I  had  no
trouble getting up early and being ready to go by 6:10.  It was  39  degrees
in my tent. I began in trees gradually working my way to a broad snow  gully
directly below Crescent Mtn. Since the  gully  was  quite  steep,  still  in
shade and the snow frozen I donned crampons. I kept them on until  the  last
100 feet of rock scrambling to the summit which I reached at 8:50 (2140  ft,
2:40 hrs). I found neither cairn nor register and left both.

 Views were expansive though a bit hazy in the distance. I  was  immediately
taken by a very impressive looking peak with a sheer rock face to  the  west
peaking up over the ridge. I became briefly concerned when I  realized  this
was Mother Lode and next up on my agenda.  It  looked  very  difficult  from
this aspect but my fears were quickly allayed when I determined I would  not
be climbing it from that side. I put crampons back  on  to  descend  to  the
head of Crescent basin at 7000 ft then removed them as  I  entered  sunshine
and the snow quickly turned to slush.  I  traversed  below  the  ridge  line
until I could gain the ridge at the only possible place between cornices  on
the 7560 ft saddle north of South Creek Butte. The final bit to  the  saddle
was very steep and I had to pass  under  a  cornice  that  was  melting  and
sending down small sloughs. After recent events this made me very nervous.

From the saddle I traversed downward north across a  series  of  loose  rock
ribs and snow gullies to the lower 7440 ft saddle  SE  of  Mother  Lode  and
followed the easy SE ridge to the summit at 12:15 (3300  ft,  5:30  hrs).  I
found a cairn but no register so left one of mine. It  was  so  pleasant  on
the summit with sun and no wind that I spent a  full  hour  for  lunch  even
removing boots to dry a bit and taking a short nap while  ladybugs  used  me
for a launching pad.

I returned to the Mother Lode saddle. I didn\'t want to repeat my mixed  rock
and snow traverse from South Creek Butte saddle. Instead it  was  easier  to
take the further drop to 7280 to  continuous  snow  below  all  rock  before
climbing directly up to the summit of South Creek Butte at  2:30  (3700  ft,
8:20 hrs) where I stayed 30  minutes.  Debris  from  a  burned  lookout  was
scattered about. To return I followed the left side of the ridge  the  short
distance to the saddle and picked up my tracks going down past the  cornice.
Again I was nervous. I kicked off sloughs as  I  went  down.  The  top  snow
layer has still not consolidated.

I soon left my uphill track from Crescent  for  a  more  direct  descent  to
Crescent Basin. I am not sure it was any better as I was forced way  to  the
right to avoid cliffs. Once in the flat of the  basin  it  was  easy  travel
back to camp at 4:40. I certainly had time to go out this day but  I  really
didn\'t want to also do the long drive  home  partially  in  the  dark  which
meant I would car camp. It was so pleasant in my  camp  I  decided  I  would
rather spend another night there even though the forecast was for  rain  the
next day, and so I did. It was a real treat  lounging  around  in  the  warm
sunshine. Usually when I return to a high camp it is too late, I am  in  too
much of a hurry, I am too tired or the weather is too  lousy  to  completely
enjoy myself.

Day total: 4.5 miles, 3700 ft and 10:30 hrs

Saturday, June 18 - Sure enough light rain came in during the night  however
by the time I was packed and ready to go at  6:45  it  had  stopped  and  it
rained no more on the way out. Wet brush did require putting on  rain  pants
though but trip out was really  quite  enjoyable.  Being  rested  helped.  I
reached the car at 9:15 ready to tackle the long drive home (4.5  miles  and
2:30 hrs). Once over Snoqualmie Pass it rained constantly.

Trip total: 13.5 miles and 6300 ft in 2.5 days

Marsupial Mtn (7917 ft - P717 - Gilbert Quad) - June 21-22, 2011

Tuesday, June 21 - I had so much fun last week on Crescent and  Mother  Lode
I returned to the Twisp area this week for another  trip.  Then  I  went  up
South Creek so this time I thought it appropriate to go up  North  Creek.  I
got a very late start (2:45) as I couldn\'t leave town until after a  morning
orthodontist appointment.  Thanks heavens for long daylight hours this  time
of year (this was, by the way, the first  day  of  summer).   I  was  slowly
plodding up the trail in the hot sun (definitely shorts weather) when I  was
passed by two young gals with two large yellow labs  out  for  a  day  hike.
When I mentioned in conversation that I was  worried  about  getting  across
North Creek (I could see it raging below  the  trail)  they  seemed  unaware
that the trail even crossed the creek and that if it did there would  be  no
bridge. I caught up to them at a side creek about a  mile  and  a  half  up.
They thought this was the crossing I was talking about. Hardly! It  was  not
a problem, barely 4 feet across and even had  a  log  across  it,  but  they
decided to turn around anyway worried about their dogs. I  would  think  the
dogs could jump across in a single leap but then  I  tend  to  underestimate
the concerns of the ordinary hiker. I have been  hanging  out  with  climber
types too long. They watched to make sure I crossed  safely  which  made  me
self-conscious. It sure would have been embarrassing  to  have  slipped  and
fallen in.

I continued on the trail through several lovely  green  meadows  alive  with
avalanche lilies before I began running into snow about 5000 ft. At 3  miles
and 5100 I came to the crossing of North Creek. As feared I could  not  find
a way across. On the Plan B, which was to parallel the creek  on  the  south
side. This worked well except for being slow going in the now  solid  slushy
snow cover. My main concern was that I now doubted I would find a snow  free
spot to camp being stuck on the shady side of  the  creek.  That  being  the
case I figured I might just as well go  all  the  way  to  North  Lake  even
though I was sure it would be completely snowed  in.  I  pulled  into  North
Lake at 7:30 and to my pleasant surprise found a tiny bare  spot  of  ground
large enough for my tiny tent right on the lake shore.

Total: 5.5 miles, 2100 ft and 4:45 hrs

Wednesday, June 22 - I was up and going by 5:55. It appeared there might  be
a route directly from camp up the east slope but  the  map  contours  looked
awfully close together and I was  afraid  I  might  get  into  trouble  from
something I couldn\'t see from below. The surest route looked to  be  up  the
south slope so that is where I headed. I began climbing up too soon and  got
above cliffs that prevented me from getting into  the  gully  to  the  south
basin which is where I really wanted to be. So  I  just  kept  climbing  and
turned the south ridge just below its cliffs. The snow in the open was  hard
enough to require crampons and got harder  the  higher  I  went.  The  upper
south slope was quite steep and hard and required 4-5 kicks for  each  solid
toe hold. The summit block was a short class 3 scramble. I reached  the  top
at 9:10 (2200 ft, 3:15 hrs).

I found a cairn and a film can register. I fully expected it  to  have  been
placed by someone I knew well. Imagine my surprise when I read the  name  of
some stranger from Massachusetts who had climbed the peak  in  September  of
2001. What is up with that? I left his film can  but  added  a  register  of
mine. Despite gorgeous views, I only stayed on top 25 minutes  as  I  wanted
to get home at a reasonable hour. I was leaving town for  a  family  reunion
on Friday and had things to do. I had to back down  the  upper  south  slope
but the snow was already getting softer and  I  easily  made  better  steps.
Later I imagine it would get worse as the day warmed  even  more,  with  the
surface soughing off and breaking out. I hit  it  just  right.  I  descended
directly into the south basin and down the exit gully (solid snow)  all  the
way to North Lake, a much better way than my traverse route  up.  I  reached
camp at 11:00 (2 miles, 2200 ft, 5:05 hrs RT). I  rested  30  minutes,  then
packed up and left at noon. I hit the trail at 1:45  and  the  car  at  3:15
(5.5 miles, 3:15 hrs).

Trip Total: 13 miles and 4300 ft in 2 days

Holden Quad - July 2-5, 2011

Last year over the 4th  of  July  Jim,  Eileen,  Beth  and  I  had  made  an
unsuccessful attempt on Black Tower (we got off route and ran out  of  time)
after climbing Riddle, Flora and Puzzle. We were struck  by  the  beauty  of
Tenmile Basin which at that time was a field of gorgeous glacier lilies  and
completely melted out. We vowed to return for Black Tower and  camp  in  the
basin.  Joining for this trip were Mike, Kevin and George. Mike and  I  also
wanted to do the two prominence points  on  Sable  Ridge.  The  others  were
adding WyEast, which Mike and I had already done. Since Mike and I  had  the
same agenda we carpooled and tented together. This worked out very well.

Saturday, July 2 - We took the holiday crowded Lady II to Holden  and  hiked
the Tenmile Cr Trail to Tenmile Basin at 5600 ft. We were helped  by  a  WTA
work party\'s recent efforts on the first part and by the fact that  we  knew
exactly where the easy log across Tenmile Cr was located since we  had  used
it last year.  But our hope of camping  in  stunning  glacier  lily  meadows
were dashed by a still almost entirely snow filled basin.  Mike and  I  were
able to find a snow free tent site under a tree while the  others  ended  up
camping on snow. This year of unusual late snowpack continues to confound.

Total: 5 miles, 2700 ft and 4:40 hrs

Sunday, July 3: Sable Ridge  -  We  all  started  together  at  8:00  toward
Hilgard Pass before soon separating, Mike and I to head for Sable Ridge  and
the other five for WyEast  approaching  it  from  the  Black  Tower/Johnsons
Jonah Col. At 6600 ft Hilgard Pass  we  were  confronted  by  a  frightfully
steep descent of 300 feet on  the  other  side.  The  trail  was  completely
hidden under snow and of no help  whatsoever.  Left  to  my  own  devices  I
probably would have rappelled some of it  but  Mike  kicked  bomber  buckets
down the 45+ degree snow and teased out a way on equally  steep  slick  dirt
and rock outcroppings.  It  took  about  an  hour  to  slowly  descend  this
section. I breathed a sigh of relief when we  reached  the  lower  open  and
more gentle snow slopes of Hilgard Basin for a  further  500  foot  drop  to
5800 ft.

Once in the basin an obvious easy  looking  broad  snow  corridor  lured  us
immediately upward to what I call Col 1. The only problem was this  was  not
the col we wanted. We really wanted to be at the one farther north  (Col  2)
past what I call Sable Point. This little error cost us a  lot  of  time  as
once at Col 1 we had to traverse the west slope get past numerous  pinnacles
and we found we had to  descent  several  hundred  feet  to  get  below  the
cliffs. But before descending we decided to climb Sable Point since we  were
so close and it was an attractive summit with great views.

Once past all the pinnacles we were able to climb back up to Col 2 at  2:00,
which is where we should have been in the first place. Once at Col 2 it  was
an easy ascent to Sable South at 2:50 (3400 ft, 6:50  hrs).  After  a  short
little scramble on loose rock we found the summit  cairn  and  Roper\'s  film
can register where we learned he named it "Mt  Tragedy"  because  one  could
see the Hilgard Pass Trail where packer Ray Courtney fell to his death  with
his horses. I was not aware of this little  bit  of  history  and  I  really
didn\'t need to know that.  I  had  found  Hilgard  Pass  frightening  enough
without knowing someone had died there. Roper\'s register neglected  to  list
the date but we found out later it was  9/2/1986.  Mitch  Blanton  and  Mike
Collins had also signed in on 6/7/03 and Don and Natala Goodman on  9/11/06.
I added a new register with a pencil.

As time continued to slip past us we were coming to the conclusion  that  we
might not have time to make Sable  North  even  though  we  both  wanted  it
badly. We could see that if we could just get to Col 3  to  the  north  easy
snow slopes led all the way to that peak. But how to get  there?  Then  from
the summit of Tragedy I spotted a friendly looking snow descent. I  couldn\'t
quite see if it was continuous but I convinced Mike  we  should  give  it  a
try. Of course it wasn\'t continuous and  ended  in  a  cliff  with  a  nasty
gully. I thought we were screwed but Mike found a way down  without  needing
a rope. Once down that an easy traverse led to Col 3 at 4:15. At this  point
there was no way I wasn\'t going to make our second  summit  even  though  it
was clear we would get back to camp after dark.  I  had  invested  too  much
time and energy to give up now.  Fortunately, the rest of the  way  was  for
the most part on easy snow slopes although we had to take  another  drop  of
400 feet after crossing a rib before climbing to Col  4  and  following  the
ridge to the summit. We arrived at 6:15  to  find  Mitch  Blanton  and  Mike
Collin\'s first ascent register. Oddly they too forgot to  record  the  date.
We assumed it was the same date as  Tragedy,  6/7/03.  We  were  the  second
ascent.

Despite the time pressure we spent 30 minutes on the summit  before  quickly
retracing our steps down to Col 4 and up and over the  rib  to  near  Col  3
where we diverged from our  tracks  and  headed  on  a  descending  traverse
toward Hilgard Creek. This took less than an hour to the diverge  point  but
we soon ran into difficulties of brush and cliffs and lost  more  time.  Our
time table kept changing throughout the day.  Originally  we  wanted  to  be
back to camp by 8:30, then 9:30, then 10:00. Then we hoped  to  still  climb
up Hilgard Pass in daylight. In the end I  just  hoped  to  be  back  before
midnight. We did make this last goal. We found a reasonable  route  down  to
the valley floor and followed it about a  mile,  through  massive  avalanche
debris (more slow going) that had come down from all  sides,  to  the  upper
basin where we picked up our route to Hilgard Pass just as darkness hit.  We
needed headlamps for the steep ascent in the woods. Our buckets  steps  sure
helped as the snow was now freezing and hard. We pulled  over  the  pass  at
10:30 and soon ran into the rest of the party\'s glissade tracks coming  down
the Black Tower gully. The snow was  quite  hard  and  crampons  would  have
helped but we didn\'t stop to put them on. As we neared camp we  could  first
see a beacon of flashing light and then  a  friendly  campfire.  Jim,  bless
him, had kept the fire going for us and had hot  water  all  ready  when  we
dragged into camp at 11:15. Without that already prepared I would have  just
fallen into bed without any dinner. He even stayed up with us while  we  had
a quick dinner before turning in about midnight. I hope he  knows  how  much
we appreciated his thoughtfulness.

Total: 8 miles, 6500 ft and 15:15 hrs

Monday, July 4: Black Tower - In comparison to Sable Ridge, Black Tower  was
a walk in the park. Good thing as I for one was totally wiped out. We got  a
late start at 9:30 after a very leisurely  breakfast.  The  snow  was  still
frozen and crampons helpful. All seven of us were together  for  this  climb
as we climbed to a notch on the west ridge. Here we puzzled out a route  via
an easy ledge that led to a series of easy  but  loose  gullies  on  the  SW
slope. Don Goodman\'s advice was the most helpful of any of the  other  vague
route descriptions we had, "if you need a rope  you  are  off  route".  With
this in mind we worked our way to the summit at 1:00  (2300  ft,  3:30  hr).
The final bit was a scramble on a fun class3+ fin. We spent over an hour  on
top all looking at where we had been the day  before.  Though  not  strictly
necessary we did two rappels to get down, mostly to avoid a section of  very
loose down climbing in a gully.

Partway down the snow gully Kevin and George took their  leave  to  head  to
Stehekin via Company Creek Trail. They had stashed their heavy packs on  the
way up. Mike and I warned them about the steep descent off Hilgard Pass  and
wished them luck. They had two ropes so should  have  had  no  problem.  The
rest of us glissaded and plunge stepped the now soft snow reaching  camp  at
5:00. After a final dinner together, Beth, Jim and  Eileen  then  also  took
their leave to camp lower down and catch the earlier boat, Beth to  Stehekin
to climb Dark Pk, Jim and Eileen to Chelan for R&R, the next day. That  left
Mike and me to relax the rest of the day and turn in early.  Neither  of  us
wanted to go anywhere or do anything.

Total: 2 miles, 2400 ft and 7:30 hrs

Tuesday, July 5 - Mike and I woke at 7:00  and  left  at  9:30.  We  had  no
problem getting to Holden by 12:30 in time to clean up a bit  and  have  ice
cream at the store which opens at 1:00.  I  couldn\'t  believe  the  generous
scoop of yummy Huckleberry Heaven I got for only $1. Then the  bus  at  1:45
and the boat at 2:30. We ended this wonderful trip with a delicious meal  at
the Big Y and a stop for fresh cherries at Miller Orchard. The only  fly  in
the ointment was we got stopped for close  to  an  hour  for  rock  blasting
going over Snoqualmie Pass (8-9:00). A minor inconvenience  in  the  overall
scheme of things.

Day Total: 5 miles, 250 ft and 3 hours

Trip Total: 20 miles and 11,850 ft in 4 days

Saturday, July 9 - There were only 3 cars parked at Trinity when  I  arrived
at 10:30, pretty sparse for a sunny weekend. I think the  late  snowpack  is
keeping the usual hikers and backpackers away. The good trail  was  pleasant
easy hiking for the first five miles with  a  dozen  or  so  logs  to  cross
despite the website saying the trail had been logged out already. Not a  big
problem to foot travel but why would they say this  if  it  were  not  true?
Then snow began intermittently, gradually becoming more solid. Still  enough
sections were visual I was able to stay  on  course  until  the  last  mile.
There was no sign of anyone else having been this way. I was  dismayed  when
I pulled into 5900 ft Buck Creek Pass and found it completely snowed  in.  I
was hoping for a few bare spots, however small, but I  could  find  none  at
all. Of more concern than the snow (I could camp on snow) was the fact  that
I could also find no running water.  I did not bring  enough  fuel  to  melt
snow for water for 3 days. I wandered around for the better part of an  hour
getting more and more desperate when I happened upon a tiny flat  bare  site
with a tiny snowmelt trickle nearby on a bench below  Liberty  Cap  west  of
the pass at 5800 ft. I was saved. This was evidently in an established  camp
area as signs were on the trees.

Total: 10.5 miles, 3600 ft, 7 hrs

Sunday, July 10: Liberty Cap, Mt Cleator, Mt Berge and Napeequa Pk - I  knew
this would be a long day and it was. My main goals were the Top200 peaks  of
Berge and Napeequa. Anything else would be frosting on the cake. I began  by
going over Liberty Cap which seemed the  most  direct  approach.   Snow  was
frozen rock hard on the steep slopes and crampons essential. In fact I  kept
crampons on all day except when on rock.  I reached the flat summit at  7:50
(1000 ft, 1:05 hrs) where I had a good view of where I was going. Years  ago
I had climbed Buck Mtn from Louis Cr and came out via the  trail  over  High
Pass to Buck Creek Pass. I vaguely remember it  as  wandering  up  and  down
along the ridge bypassing cliffs and high points. But  without  the  benefit
of this trail I had my work cut out just getting to High Pass. First  I  had
to drop off Liberty Cap to the saddle  with  Pt  6909,  then  traverse  west
around that rocky point to the saddle to the north  with  Rally  Cap.  As  I
then traversed east around Rally Cap I was disheartened  to  see  the  ridge
saddle with Cleator completely guarded by a continuous wall of  cornices.  I
could see no obvious way through. I lost a lot of time here searching for  a
route. I backed off one attempt as  too  steep  and  exposed.  I  eventually
found a weakness in the wall high up on the ridge about  300  ft  below  the
summit of Rally Cap.

Once on the ridge again it was an easy climb to the  summit  of  Mt  Cleator
(2500 ft, 4:30 hrs), which I thought  would  be  a  direct  approach  to  Mt
Berge. It wasn\'t. I couldn\'t follow the ridge and had to  drop  to  7000  ft
High Pass (5:30 hrs). I also couldn\'t see a direct route (that I  could  do)
up the north slope to the saddle between the two  Berge  summits.  The  snow
couloir looked frightfully steep and broken by a schrund. So I  did  an  end
run dropping farther to 6760 ft and  climbing  a  snow  gully  on  the  west
flank. It was still steep with a broken section in the middle and  I  didn\'t
like it but I made it up. More gentle snow and heather led  to  the  western
summit block with class 3+ scrambling to and along the  ridge  to  the  high
point at 2:00 (3650 ft, 7:15 hrs). I took a 30 minute  lunch  break  in  the
sun to air out wet feet.

I did not want to go down the steep gully. I had a hard enough  time  coming
up. I thought I could find a better way down farther  south.  I  didn\'t.  To
make a long story short I got hung up on slabby  cliffs  and  lost  over  an
hour doing three 50 foot rappels with my panic rope. Once on  snow  again  I
made a beeline for Napeequa traversing around  the  basin  below  High  Pass
before climbing to the East Ridge. Here I made a strategic error by  gaining
the ridge too soon and lost more time scrambling class 3-4 blocks along  the
ridge to the true summit. A direct  approach  would  have  been  better.   I
finally reached the summit at 7:00 (5200 ft, 12:15 hr). I had no time to  do
anything but add a new register  to  the  two  pitiful  soggy  ones  already
there.

From Napeequa I made a high traverse to  High  Pass  arriving  at  8:30.  It
killed me to have to pass on both Cirque Mtn and Rally Cap  when  I  was  so
close but I had no time left. As it was I was going to get back  well  after
dark in a repeat reminiscent of Sable Ridge last week with Mike. I  retraced
my steps to the Rally Cap saddle arriving to  stunning  sunset  lighting  on
Glacier Pk and made it to Pt 6909 saddle with still  enough  light  to  see.
From there on I needed my headlamp. I elected  to  traverse  around  Liberty
Cap rather go over it as I was running out of steam. That went  well  and  I
dragged into camp at 11:30.

Total: 10 miles, 6050 ft and 16:45 hrs

Monday, July 11: Helmet Butte and Flower Dome - I wasn\'t sure I  would  have
the time or the energy for these two peaks. I decided  to  let  my  wake  up
time decide. Well I woke up at 7:00 and figured  I  could  squeeze  them  in
before heading out. I did but in  a  recurring  theme  of  this  trip  where
everything turned out to be harder than expected they  did  too.  Or  rather
Helmet Butte did. It was a straight shot up the south slope but  was  capped
by class 4 rock (the Helmet?) and in going as light as possible I  had  left
my panic rope in camp. Dumb! Actually the rock was not  that  difficult  but
getting to it was as it was guarded by steep snow and nasty moats. I had  to
drop a bit on the west side to the west ridge and ascend from there.  It  is
a marvelous viewpoint but Glacier Peak was in the clouds - a sign of  things
to come. Then it was straight down and up to the easy Flower Dome  and  then
back to camp.

Total: 3 miles, 2250 ft and 5 hrs RT

I ate lunch and even napped  for  30  minutes  in  partial  sunshine  before
heading out at 3:20. The trip out was uneventful except for a few  sprinkles
the last mile. I did make the car before dark.

Total: 10.5 miles, 300 ft and 5:30 hrs.

Trip Total: 34 miles and 12,200 ft in 3 days

Frisco Mtn (7760+ - P480) - McGregor Mtn Quad and Crooked Bum (6937 -  P857)
- Mt Arriva Quad - July 19, 2011

After failing on The Needles the day before  (we  couldn\'t  get  across  the
moat at the notch) I didn\'t want to leave the area completely  empty  handed
so car camped another night at the Cutthroat Lake TH  with  several  options
in mind depending upon weather. Upon awakening  to  fog  I  settled  on  the
easiest, Crooked Bum directly above Heather Pass.

I parked at the Rainy Lake Picnic area, which still does not  have  complete
access  due  to  snow  impassible  to  vehicles.  I  easily   followed   the
intermittently snow covered Lake Ann/Maple Pass trail to  Heather  Pass  and
from there mixed snow/rock to the summit  of  Crooked  Bum  (2100  ft,  2:30
hrs). The entire way was in fog and I could see nothing. As I was placing  a
small register on top the clouds suddenly began to part revealing the  lower
flank of Black Peak. Wow! This would be a great viewpoint on  a  clear  day.
As I descended the  visibility  improved  to  the  point  I  could  see  the
beautiful Maple Pass ridge and all the way to Frisco Mtn. This  suckered  me
in to climbing that peak.

I was aware that Franklin and Carla had climbed Frisco  a  couple  of  weeks
previously but had not read their TR and had no detailed knowledge of  their
route. So it is interesting that I independently ended up  going  the  exact
same way. I wandered the lovely ridge from Maple Pass to cross the  shoulder
on the north ridge of Frisco at 6960 ft, dropped to the tarn at 6080 ft  and
traversed around cliffs into the big basin NE  of  Frisco.  I  saw  the  col
between Frisco and Rainy was corniced so nixed accessing the east  ridge  at
that point and instead headed for a  higher  one  at  essentially  the  same
place as Franklin and Carla. They didn\'t mention any moat problem but I  was
nervous crossing a suspect snow bridge onto the rock  so  either  conditions
had changed, I was at a slightly different place or I am a wimp.

By now the weather had completely deteriorated and it was  raining  steadily
with no visibility. It was all I could do to force  my  way  to  the  summit
(4800 ft, 7:50 hrs). Thank heavens the rock was easy. I stayed on  top  only
long enough to add a register next to the survey  marker.  Adding  Rainy  to
the itinerary was now out of  the  question  (I  had  thought  I  might).  I
chuckled to myself - too rainy for Rainy. I returned to  the  tarn,  climbed
to the ridge above Rainy Lake, picked up  the  Maple  Pass  loop  trail  and
followed it back to the car. Despite the turn of the weather I felt  pleased
with my day\'s adventure.

Total: 10 miles, 5300 ft and 11:20 hrs

Friday, July 22 - Mike, Matt and I started from the  White  River  Trail  at
close to noon. There were no bugs at the TH to start but barely  20  minutes
into the hike they came out  in  droves,  nasty  mosquitoes  with  voracious
appetites that neither clothing nor repellant seemed to quell completely.  I
got drilled through both my shirt and gloves. I think they  were  making  up
for lost time on this warm day, one of the few  of  the  season.  The  White
River Trail was  in  good  shape  to  the  Boulder  Pass  junction  but  has
evidently been completely abandoned  after  that.  The  next  2.2  miles  to
Thunder Creek is almost all in thick overgrown brush, much of it head  high.
It is slow going and tiring. It would be awful if wet. This  is  really  too
bad as the tread is still good (when you can see it) and all it needs  is  a
good brushing out.

The old  bridge  over  Thunder  Creek  was  washed  out  but  engineer  Mike
constructed a useable if somewhat scary one by adding a comforting  handrail
to a spindly log already in place. We left the trail about  0.75  miles  beyond
Thunder Creek (7 miles, 750 ft, 4:30 hrs).  The  beginning  of  the  Thunder
Creek trail is obscure to non-existent. We sure didn\'t find  it  right  away
even though both Mike and I had been on it before (Mike  many  times).   But
you definitely want to take the time to find  this  trail  or  you  will  be
crashing horrible brush for hours. As it was we missed it and lost  an  hour
before running into it. It is quite good, once on  it,  to  the  open  slope
below Luahna then becomes more obscure as it enters  trees  again.  We  also
started running into snow which didn\'t in help sticking to the  trail.  When
we pulled into the lovely meadows of Lower Thunder Basin at 7:00  we  called
it a day even though we had planned to camp in the Upper Basin. It  was  too
late and it was clear the Upper Basin would be under  snow  (9  miles,  2200
ft, 7 hrs).

Saturday, July 23 - Starting at 6:30 we hiked to the far end  of  the  lower
basin where Mike knew about a trail (he had worked on it years ago)  through
the brush to the left of the waterfall. Again it pays to locate this  trail.
It is not as good as the lower trail but it really helps in getting  through
this brushy section. Look for cut brush and logs. We did  a  better  job  of
finding this one and followed it to the Upper  Basin  which,  as  suspected,
was completely covered with snow. We then  climbed  steep  heather  next  to
creek that drains some  tarns  to  the  upper  snow  slopes.  The  snow  was
somewhat icy so we donned crampons for the traverse  to  the  notch  in  the
East Ridge of Tenpeak. Below the notch we stashed unneeded gear.

Snow led almost to the notch, covering much of what  is  reported  to  be  a
loose gully. The notch itself was a cramped airy perch above  a  chockstone.
The first moves out of the notch were the hardest (est. 5.6). Then it  eased
to a belay at a rappel anchor. Matt did a nice lead  followed  by  Mike  and
last me. I was glad to have a top rope for that section.  The  second  pitch
was much easier, really a scramble. We made the summit  at  1:45  (4200  ft,
7:15 hrs). The old register placed in 1972 was still in good  shape  and  we
happily added our names. We were the first to sign in  since  2006.  Tenpeak
is not climbed as often as it used to be what with the  now  more  difficult
access.

We scrambled down on top rope, with Mike  belaying,  to  the  rappel  anchor
where one 80 ft rappel got us down to the snow  below  the  notch.  We  then
headed for West Peak on a high traverse to reach the saddle  south  of  that
summit at 5:30, where again we stashed unneeded gear.  The  south  ridge  of
West Peak turned out to be a delightful climb marred only  by  the  pressure
of time running out. The first part was  easy  scrambling  onto  the  almost
level crest. We bypassed two pinnacles on the left with a few  harder  moves
to the final notch below the start of  the  impressive  narrow  knife  edged
ridge where we set up the first belay. Again Matt led. I followed next  then
Mike. The knife edge looked impossibly steep but the holds were so  good  it
could almost be considered a scramble except  for  the  wild  exposure.  One
slip unroped and you would be dead.  Surely  this  has  to  be  one  of  the
classic ridges of the Cascades. The second pitch was  up  the  final  summit
tower which looked a lot more difficult than it turned out to be.  From  the
last belay it was a short scramble to the  summit  cairn  at  7:30  where  I
found an empty tube (5100 ft, 13 hrs). I added a large register.  This  peak
deserves one.

We rappelled the summit tower then belayed along the knife  edge  with  Mike
going last. We made it back to the saddle at 9:00. The rest of  the  evening
was a blur of descending  refreezing  snow  (crampons  on  again)  to  Upper
Thunder Basin then wandering around in the dark looking  for  the  trail  to
the Lower Basin. A combination of collective memory  and  waypoints  entered
on my GPS on the way up helped to keep us on track. But it was  slow  going.
We did eventually find the trail. We reached camp at 12:45 am  still  taking
time for dinner before turning in at 1:45. I for one was starved.

Total: 8 miles 5300 ft and 18:15 hrs

Sunday, July 24 - I took Mike at his word who proclaimed  the  night  before
he wasn\'t getting up until the sun hit his tent. This happened at  8:45.  We
had a leisurely breakfast before packing up and heading out at  10:45.  None
of us were looking forward to the prospect of brush, bugs and heat,  all  of
which turned out to be as bad as expected but  mercifully  came  to  an  end
when we hit the TH at 4:15.

Total: 9 miles, 300 ft and 5:30 hrs

Trip Total: 26 miles and 7800 ft in 3 days

Mt Index, Middle Peak (5493 ft - P533 - Index Quad) - July 29-31, 2011

I always felt that if any peak would prevent  me  from  finishing  the  Home
Court List it would be the Middle Peak  of  Index.   Beckey  describes  this
extremely rugged peak as one of the most inaccessible spots in  the  Cascade
Range. I pondered for years how I could possibly climb it looking  at  every
conceivable approach and route and concluded there were only two options,  a
traverse from the North Peak or a  traverse  from  the  Main  (South)  Peak.
After reading trip reports from both Don Goodman and Tom Sjolseth  of  their
climbs I feared the peak was simply beyond my capability.  Still  I  dreamed
and continued working on the list until I only had this  one  left.  Perhaps
some super climber would take pity on me and help me achieve my  goal.  Well
one did - Tom. He was the force behind getting me up this beast and I  can\'t
thank him enough. I must also thank Franklin who joined forces with Tom  and
greatly contributed to the success of a very  difficult  climb.  There  were
moments when I wasn\'t sure if we were going to make it off the mountain.

Friday, July 29 - The plan was to  traverse  from  the  Main  Peak.  Mike  C
joined as the fourth member of the party. We started from  the  Lake  Serene
TH at 9:00, hiked to the lake (1:50  hr),  skirted  the  west  side  to  the
saddle in the NE ridge and followed the climber\'s trail up  the  brushy  and
rocky crest to where it flattened at 3900 ft. From here we  traversed  south
Â¼ mile to enter the snow  filled  east  gully.  This  gully  had  a  schrund
forming at about 5200 ft in  a  narrow  constriction  and  the  snow  bridge
looked as if it only had days of life left. Near the top  of  the  gully  we
exited right onto steep slopes that led to the gentle SE ridge  crest  where
we found a pleasant camp at 4:15 on heather at 5800 ft about  .3  mile  from
the main summit.

After setting up camp we all climbed to the main summit  and  beyond  for  a
view of the Middle Peak and the start of the route for the next day.

Total: 7 miles, 5500 ft and 7:15 hrs

Saturday, July 30 - We were up at 4:00 and underway by first light at  5:10.
Our goal was to get to the Main-Middle notch at 4960 ft. The  first  problem
was where exactly to drop off the Main Peak. We had the advantage  that  Tom
had just done the traverse from the North Peak the year before and had  been
up the route. But going down everything looks different. I have no clue  how
one would find the way without at least some prior  knowledge.  The  terrain
is extremely rugged and complicated. We started by  scrambling  down  the  N
Ridge a short ways and doing a double rappel to heather  benches  below.  We
traversed the heather to notch 1. Two more double rappels took us into  what
I call the Evil Gully (a truly nasty feature splitting the upper  face)  and
crossed in the moat of some snow. Then up one  pitch  to  the  base  of  the
Wedge Gendarme at a saddle. Here while waiting last to come up I was hit  in
the shoulder by a small rock. Not devastating but unnerving none the less.

The route describes climbing the crest of the Wedge Gendarme which  must  be
easier in reverse as  Tom  backed  off  climbing  to  the  top.  Instead  we
retreated to notch 2 lower on skiers left for more rappels to get  past  the
gendarme. Then up to a wooded notch 3 and a rappel down the other side to  a
slabby ramp (above a deep gully) that we scrambled down and  around  and  up
to cross a minor rib. We were now on the Lake  Serene  side  of  the  ridge.
More rappels straight down brought us to  the  Main-Middle  notch  at  12:30
(7:20 hrs). I actually lost count  of  the  rappels  but  I  think  Franklin
counted 9 (he kept notes), all double rappels on our two 50m ropes.

We donned crampons to cross the icy snow and moat in  the  notch  (unroped).
At the far side I lost sight of Franklin who came last.  I  heard  a  scream
and the noise of a  body  falling.  Panic  then  relief  when  I  heard  his
reassuring voice. He had slipped on a loose rock and tumbled  head  first  a
few feet. He did some  damage  (nose  and  knee  mostly)  but  was  able  to
continue.

From the notch a short pitch in a chimney put us on scrambling  terrain  the
rest of the way up. This is not to say it was obvious  finding  the  correct
line up but at least the climbing was not difficult. We topped  out  on  the
summit at 2:30 (1000 ft, 9:20 hrs).  Now  stressed  for  time  we  took  the
minimum amount for pictures and to place a new register  then  took  off  at
2:55. We scrambled down doing one rappel directly into the  notch  bypassing
the chimney.

Now it was all uphill with several problems looming ahead. Many of our  down
rappels could not be reversed and we had to find other routes up. The  first
problem was a difficult (5.6 or 5.7?) pitch right out of  the  notch.   Then
easier terrain to a ledge system that led climbers left  to  the  minor  rib
where we had rapped from earlier. From here Tom tried going straight up  but
backed off. So it was down to scramble the same slabby ramp up that  we  had
scrambled down to the base of the rappel from  notch  3.  Here  was  another
difficult pitch to the right that put us at wooded notch 3.

Darkness was now encroaching and it was clear we would not  make  camp  this
day but Franklin put in an another pitch in waning  light  to  notch  2  and
left a fixed line before we settled in for  a  bivy  at  notch  3.  We  each
claimed a spot but  none  was  comfortable  with  more  than  sitting  room.
Franklin had carried a stove and he set it up to melt some nearby  snow  for
water. Tom had a sil shelter that we rigged in case it began to rain  during
the night. Franklin had gotten an updated  forecast  on  his  Smartphone  at
6:00 that had changed since the start of the trip from 0 %  chance  of  rain
to 37% starting after  11  pm,  the  worst  news  possible  in  our  present
position.

I had taken long johns, extra socks, full rain  gear,  a  polyester  sweater
and down jacket so started off  reasonably  warm  but  eventually  the  cold
seeped in as the night crawled by. I think I dozed a total of  2  hours  all
night. Somewhere around midnight Tom went downhill  a  ways  and  started  a
fire. We kept the fire going  off  and  on  for  a  few  hours  but  it  was
difficult for all of us to get around it at  the  same  time  on  the  steep
slope. Still it was comforting and warm when close to it and scavenging  for
firewood gave us something to do. Luckily the rain held off so  that  didn\'t
add to our problems, at least not yet.

We left the bivy at the first glimmer of light, about 4:30 by which time  we
were enveloped in thick fog. We made it up the fixed pitch  when  the  first
raindrops hit.  Another  pitch  took  us  to  the  saddle  below  the  Wedge
Gendarme where progress came to a standstill.  For  a  couple  of  hours  we
stood in the same spot with the rain coming down trying to  figure  out  how
to do this last pitch across the Evil Gully. The  ramp  route  left  of  the
gully was not that steep but was exposed, terribly slick  in  the  rain  and
offered no reassuring protection.  We at the very least needed an anchor  to
rap into the gully. When I saw Tom faltering I knew we were  in  trouble.  I
kept thinking of Beckey\'s warning about the Middle Peak,  "the  consequences
of either accident or bad weather could be  serious".   Serious?  How  about
deadly! I began to wonder if maybe we wouldn\'t make it off this mountain.

My life was now in the hands of Tom and Franklin and bless  them  they  both
came through under very trying conditions. They ended up leaving 2 cams  and
a nut in questionable cracks to make a reasonable anchor. We made it  across
the gully and onto the ledge leading to the first notch and salvation.  From
there it was a scramble back to camp at 12:00 (2250 ft and 31  hrs  RT  from
camp, 7:30 hrs from bivy).

Completely drenched we packed as quickly as possible and headed down. As  if
we hadn\'t had enough problems, near the top of the steep snow  of  the  east
gully Mike slipped about 40 feet and fell into a 10  foot  moat.  I  watched
this happen and it looked really bad. I thought we would have to call for  a
rescue. But miraculously Mike was ambulatory although he hit  his  head  and
turned his ankle. He abandoned his pack in the moat so he could hobble  out.
Franklin and I decided to rappel  to  below  the  schrund  bridge  and  Mike
followed us. Good thing as Tom downclimbed the  snow,  discovered  the  snow
bridge was gone and had to jump across. The rest of the way out was  without
incidence although  we  did  several  more  single  rope  rappels  down  the
slippery climbers trail on the rocky ridge crest. We reached Lake Serene  at
7:00 and the cars at 8:50 where finally I could let my guard down, happy  to
have survived the most difficult and intense climb of my life. Once again  I
want to thank Tom and Franklin for making  it  happen  and  getting  us  out
safely.

Kopeetah Divide (7723 ft - P563) - Glacier Pk East Quad - August 6-8, 2011

My main goal on this trip was theTop200 Kololo.  Mike  had  already  climbed
that peak but was keen to get both The Hive and Kopeetah Divide  nearby.  He
was willing to reclimb my peak if I would  accompany  him  for  his.  So  we
joined forces for mutual benefit. It  was  nice  to  have  his  company  and
support. The problem was how to approach.  The  best  would  have  been  The
North Fork Sauk but the road is still currently closed  some  9  miles  from
the TH. I had thought to go up Lightening Creek but neither of us wanted  to
battle the horrible brush of the White  River  Trail  again  so  soon  after
Tenpeak. So we settled on the Meander Meadow Trail.

Saturday, August 6 - We got started on the  trail  at  10:00.  There  was  a
party of 4 young women starting just before us carrying snowshoes. We  tried
to tell them any snow would be hard and they wouldn\'t  be  needed  but  "the
report says Meander Meadow is 70% snow covered", they replied.  They  seemed
to equate any snow with snowshoes being necessary. I must say I  have  never
seen anyone take snowshoes on a trail  trip  in  August  before.  We  played
leapfrog with them all the way to Meander Meadow where  they  were  planning
to camp for 2 nights.

The trail is well used but has not been brushed  out  for  some  years.  The
brush is nowhere near as bad as the White  River  Trail  but  is  still  bad
enough to be annoying in the open areas. After about 4.5 miles of  flat  the
trail climbs steadily another 1.5 miles to Meander  Meadow.  The  trail  has
been rerouted to the south slope since I  was  last  here.  Previously  (and
still shown on maps) it crossed the meadow to the north  slope  and  took  a
roundabout way to the ridge crest. This more direct approach saved  us  both
time and distance. We reached the ridge below Kodak Peak at 3:00, elev  5760
ft (7.5 miles, 2800 ft, 5 hrs).

We now had to drop some 700 ft to Indian Pass at 5000 ft. On  this  northern
slope it was all snow and there was no sign of anyone having been this  way.
We lost the trail but picked it up again at Indian Pass. The trail was  then
easily followed around the west side  of  Indian  Head  Peak  and  past  the
junction with the White River Trail. This is a beautiful section of the  PCT
and I particularly enjoyed  the  greenness  of  it.  Shortly  after  passing
Reflection Pond, as the trail rounded the ridge to the northern  slope,  the
terrain became all snow covered once again. As we neared White Pass  we  met
up with a party of four returning from having  climbed  Glacier  Peak.  They
had biked and hiked from the North Fork Sauk and were camped in the  closest
spot to the pass (camping is not allowed on the pass itself or ridge) so  we
had to drop over 100 feet on the south side to find a  site  for  ourselves,
arriving at 7:00. Our hopes for a few hours of camp sunshine  vanished  when
it began to fog in as soon as we had the tent up. Where the  heck  did  this
come from? I thought we had a  bomber  bluebird  forecast.  You  just  can\'t
count on any forecast this year.

Total: 13 miles, 3900 ft and 9 hrs

Sunday, August 7 - We didn\'t get as early a start as we  wanted  as  it  was
completely fogged in when we awoke at 5:00. It is so hard to  get  motivated
when you can\'t see anything and we weren\'t even sure what was going  on,  if
a system was moving in or if it was just marine air  that  would  burn  off.
There is no way we could find our way if it remained foggy all  day.  So  it
was 6:30 before we left. We knew we  had  a  long  day  ahead  and  we  were
already behind schedule.

We picked up the Foam Creek Trail at White Pass and followed it to where  we
could access the White Mtn Ridge saddle. As the  snow  steepened  we  donned
crampons and left them on most of the day. Meanwhile the fog began  to  thin
and sunshine appear but a heavy fogbank persisted all day below  us  to  the
west. To the east it was clear. We crossed the ridge at 6600 ft and  dropped
400 ft on the other side to the large White  Chuck  Flat.  We  actually  had
hoped to camp here but ran out of time and  energy  and  it  was  completely
snow-covered. We had a much nicer snow free campsite at White Pass.

From the flat we worked our way up gentle slopes to the White Chuck  Glacier
then steeper slopes to the notch in the ridge NW of Kololo.  There  were  no
signs of crevasses so we didn\'t bother  roping  up  but  developing  suncups
were annoying. We crossing the notch at 7900 ft and headed up  the  snowy  W
peak first before climbing the rocky main summit at 11:30 (4.5  miles,  3000
ft, 5 hrs).  There was no register.

I had my peak, now it was Mike\'s turn to get his. We  had  removed  crampons
to climb the rock of Kololo and had left  them  off.  While  descending  the
south side Mike slipped on a  very  icy  patch  and  warned  me  to  put  my
crampons back on. It was water ice and I had trouble  crossing  it  even  in
crampons. We had to drop farther than wanted to pass cliffs and  then  climb
back up to the saddle to the Honeycomb Glacier. Once  on  the  Honeycomb  it
was a very gentle and gradual descent to the saddle below  the  Hive.  Again
crevasses were not yet an issue so we didn\'t rope up.

I had looked down on The Hive from W Tenpeak a  few  weeks  ago.  It  is  an
attractive horn of a peak and so I was not unhappy to climb it  even  though
it was a heck of a distance from Kololo and all downhill  (which  of  course
means uphill on the way back). From the  saddle  a  short  steep  snowslope,
then heather, pumice and a final fun rock scramble led to the  summit  where
we found a Roper film can buried in the cairn (6.5 miles, 3800 ft,  8  hrs).
He had evidently named it "Sweet Peak". The view of Tenpeak was  impressive.


Kopeetah Divide was next. It is not as attractive as The Hive but  the  view
of Glacier Peak from the flat spacious summit is  to  die  for  (7.5  miles,
4600 ft, 10 hrs). It would make a grand bivy site. We found no  register  in
the cairn so left one. Now to get home we had to  regain  the  lost  900  ft
back to Kololo Notch. We stayed on a direct  route  on  the  north  side  of
Kololo reaching the notch at 7:00 (10 miles, 5600 ft, 12:30  hrs).  We  were
dismayed to see the west side fog boiling up ever higher in  our  direction.
It was clear we were going descend into it. It was also  clear  we  wouldn\'t
make camp before dark. Great! Just what we need - the dual problem of  route
finding in the fog and the dark.

Once on the featureless White Chuck Glacier we were essentially in  a  white
out and could see no  landmarks.  Fortunately  Mike  has  a  good  sense  of
direction and I had a track to follow on my  GPS.  So  between  the  two  we
slowly navigated our way out reaching camp  at  9:45.  Hey  compared  to  my
track record of late that was early. We even got to bed before 11:00.

Total: 14 miles, 6000 ft and 15:15 hrs.

Monday, August 8 - Again it was foggy in the morning but it cleared  quickly
after we left at 9:00. The rest of the day was in  sunshine  and  heat.  And
bugs. A few annoying ones appeared in the  lower  meadows  where  there  had
essentially been none on the way in. Surprisingly we met several parties  on
the way out. One was camped above Indian Pass and on a  day  trip  to  White
Mtn. Another was camped on Kodak Peak and headed  for  Reflection  Pond.  We
met a lone fellow at Kodak Saddle intimidated by the  snow  down  to  Indian
Pass and uncertain whether to continue. We met  another  lone  fellow  lower
down doing the Cady Ridge Loop and finally a family of three backpacking  to
Meander Meadow. By the time I reached the flat river trail my feet were  wet
and complaining in my boots. So I changed  to  dry  socks  and  trail  shoes
(doubled as camp shoes) for the rest of the way out. That really  helped  my
poor feet. I pulled into the TH a little before 6:00  a  few  minutes  after
Mike who had already washed and changed clothes.

Total: 13 miles, 1200 ft, 8:50 hrs

Horsemans Pack aka The Needle (8152 ft - P472) and  Neve  Peak  (7505  ft  -
P505) - Diablo Dam Quad - August 12-14, 2011

I have found the naming of the peaks  on  the  Snowfield  Icecap  a  puzzle.
According to Beckey the UGSG Diablo Dam Quad has  The  Needle  mismarked  at
Peak 8152. Peak 8152 is actually the Horsemans Pack and the real  Needle  is
the 8040+ ft peak farther to the north. In addition  The  Horseman  is  also
mismarked on the map.  It  is  actually  the  tower  closely  north  of  the
Horsemans Pack. Adding to the confusion is that Beckey lists  the  elevation
of the Horseman as 7760+ ft and states The  Needle  is  clearly  higher.  It
appeared to me that The Horseman is 40 ft or so  lower  than  the  Horsemans
Pack which would make it at least 8100 ft (it shows as 8080+ ft on the  map)
and thus clearly higher than the Needle. This is all very confusing  to  say
the least and I still may not have it right. All I know is  I  climbed  Peak
8152 which is a Top200 peak whatever its name.

Friday, August 12 - I hiked the Pyramid  Lake  trail  and  then  the  easily
followed but steep climber\'s trail to Pyramid Ridge. This was my third  time
on this trail so I was quite familiar with it. About half way  up  I  met  a
lone fellow coming down traveling very  fast  and  very  light.  He  had  on
shorts and carried a tiny hydration pack with  room  for  very  little  else
except crampons strapped on the outside. I assumed he climbed  Snowfield  as
a daytrip but I never verified this as he blew  right  by  me  with  nary  a
word. No time to chat I guess. I found a scenic bare spot to  camp  at  5480
even though there was much more snow than usual for this time of  year.  The
pond was still completely snowed covered  and  running  water  was  hard  to
find. There was another tent on a  heather  bench  just  below  me  but  the
occupants were gone. I was surprised when they had not returned by the  time
I turned in at 9:00. As I poked my head out of the tent  an  hour  later  to
view a beautiful full moon  I  saw  three  headlights  descending  from  the
Colonial Glacier. I figured they had a long day climbing multiple peaks.

Total: 4 miles, 4400 ft and 6 hrs

Saturday, August 13 - Before taking off for my  peaks  I  stopped  to  visit
with the party camped  below  me.  They  had  only  climbed  Snowfield,  the
lateness being due to the older fellow having knee problems  and  having  to
go very slowly. He  was  with  his  son.  When  I  mentioned  my  name  they
immediately recognized it from all the registers I have placed. I  get  that
a lot. I wished them  well  on  the  trip  out.  I  would  think  the  steep
climber\'s trail down would be a challenge for bad knees. After chatting  for
close to 20 minutes I took my leave at 7:20. I started in thin  fog  that  I
soon climbed above.

I found the ramp leading down off  the  ridge  onto  the  slopes  below  and
climbed snow (crampons needed) past a lovely waterfall onto the  flat  lower
Colonial Glacier. Here the Colonial Tarn was much larger than I  remembered,
completely filling in the basin from rock wall to rock wall. It  was  mostly
frozen and the only easy way was straight across.  This  made  me  a  little
nervous as there was open water on the edges. I was especially  freaked  out
on the return. I followed old tracks and hoped for the best. Easy  snow  put
me at the Neve Saddle at 10:00 from where I dropped onto the  Neve  Glacier.
At this point I wasn\'t sure which bump  was  Horsemans  Pack  and  ended  up
heading too far right. For the most part the  few  crevasses  I  encountered
were very small, really just cracks, and no problem but I ran into one  that
was big enough to fall into and very long that required a detour.

As I neared the ridge crest  I  headed  left  and  ran  into  an  unexpected
corniced spur ridge that required a  steep  downclimb  before  reaching  the
base of the Horseman and the Horsemans Pack. The Horseman looked  positively
wild and unclimbable but the Horsemans Pack didn\'t  look  too  easy  either.
Darn. I was under the impression this peak was non technical. There must  be
an easier way. There was. A loose dirt ramp led to the east  ridge  where  a
ledge traversed the south side to a class 3+ gully that went to the top.  It
was almost fun except for the fact that the rock was very loose  and  I  had
to be very careful. I found Don Goodman\'s register on  top  (3400  ft,  5:30
hrs). No one else had signed in  since  2006.  I  found  this  odd  since  I
thought Stefan had climbed it since that date and I know Tom and Jeff H  had
done so this year. I guess they either didn\'t find the register or they  had
no pencil (none was in it but there is one now).

I found a cozy alcove in the sun just below the  summit  where  I  spent  45
minutes on lunch and views. I then took the scenic route down heading  first
to the base of the Needle. I had thought to climb this  peak  but  the  only
access I could see was on  a  very  steep  snow  slope  above  an  extremely
intimidating bottomless schrund. Were I to lose it  and  slide  in  I  would
either be killed instantly or die in it unable to get out.   No  thank  you!
So it was on to the base of the Cats Ear. Again it  was  too  scary  for  me
alone but I did enjoy my scenic route.

I returned to Neve Saddle from where I climbed easy Neve Peak  (4500  ft,  9
hrs) with its stunning view of the Snowfield Icecap.  I  sat  on  the  broad
summit for over 30 minutes in  full  view  of  where  I  had  just  been.  I
consider Snowfield one of the most beautiful  peaks  in  all  of  the  North
Cascades, on a par with Mt Challenger. I didn\'t want to leave.  I  also  had
great views of Colonial, Paul Bunyans Stump, Pinnacle and Pyramid all  which
I had climbed on previous trips.

I was back to camp by 7:00, never having felt rushed.  What  a  pleasure  to
make it before dark and even have some time in the sun. I found a  party  of
seven camped nearby and went to  visit.  I  didn\'t  know  any  of  them  but
somehow they knew of me. The "leader" called himself Big  Steve  and  was  a
big friendly guy. They  were  on  the  Isolation  Traverse  and  since  some
weather was forecast for Monday hoped to get past  Snowfield  the  next  day
before it hit. They were prepared to spend a day in their tents.

Total: 8 miles, 4800 ft and 11:40 hrs

Sunday, August 14 - The day dawned cloudy which made the  trip  out  for  me
cool and pleasant. I am not so sure about the  Isolation  Party.  I  watched
them head up into fog about 30 minutes before I left.  On  the  way  down  I
somehow got off onto a variation trail that connected with  the  main  trail
at Pyramid Lake. I hadn\'t seen  it  on  the  way  up  but  it  made  a  nice
diversion.

Total: 4 miles, 100 ft and 4:15 hrs

Grand Total: 16 miles and 9300 ft in 3 days

Friday, August 19: To Kool-Aid Lake - The parking lot at  the  Cascade  Pass
TH was almost full when I arrived  near  noon  and  I  had  some  difficulty
finding a spot for my car. When I left a  ranger  was  taking  down  license
plate numbers. I let him know  I  would  be  gone  for  five  days.  It  was
reassuring to know that they keep track  of  people  in  case  of  a  needed
rescue. I did not need a permit for the North Cascades Park as  I  would  be
over the boundary once past Cache Col but I still signed  in  the  Climber\'s
Register at the Marblemount Ranger Station.

In 2 hours I was at Cascade Pass where the usual crowd was  gathered.  After
a short rest I took off on the good climber\'s trail up Mixup  Arm  to  Cache
Col. Most of the way to Mixup rib was on trail. Once past that  it  was  all
snow. The large cornice at the Col was passed on the  left  after  which  it
was all downhill to Kool-Aid Lake. It was only 6:00 and I  had  time  to  go
farther but the campsite was so  pleasant  here  with  flat  ground,  nearby
running water, an open dipping pool (most of the lake was still frozen)  and
rock furniture it was hard to pass up. So I opted for an early  stop  and  a
leisurely dinner with several hours to relax in the sun. Besides I  was  not
looking forward to crossing the Red Ledge. I would face my demons tomorrow.

In 2005 on the return from soloing Formidable I had fallen some 40  ft  down
the steep gully dissecting the middle of the Red Ledge when  a  rotten  snow
step broke out and I landed in a moat below. I  had  injured  my  left  arm,
which was essentially useless, could not climb back up, had  to  rappel  all
the way down the gully and struggled back to camp at Kool-Aid  Lake.  I  was
lucky to have survived and to be able to get myself out  after  a  night  of
rest. I had not been back since.

Total: 6.5 miles, 3400 ft and 5:45 hrs.

Saturday, August 20: Camp below  Spider-Formidable  Col  and  Spider  Mtn  -
After a very restful night I started at 8:00. Trail and a  long  stretch  of
unpleasant talus brought me to the base of the Red Ledge. I was  very  happy
to see it completely melted out and no problem at all. But the  snow  finger
leading to it was thin and icy and traversed above a nasty moat, so just  to
be extra safe and cautious I  donned  crampons.  Once  across  the  ledge  I
rounded the corner to begin the traverse, up and down on heather,  snow  and
scree to the base of the Middle Cascade Glacier. I stayed high on  the  left
side of the glacier, to minimize crevasses,  to  the  Spider-Formidable  Col
(the left-hand of the twin cols at the top). I then descended about  500  ft
on the other side where I found a surprisingly comfortable bivy  spot  on  a
flat slab of rock at 11:50. This would be my home for 2 nights. I  wanted  a
strategically located camp from which I could climb all three of my peaks.

I started for Spider at 1:00 by traversing upward about half a mile  to  the
first snow gully that  looked  reasonable.  It  started  out  well  but  was
steeper than it looked (I did have crampons on) had a deep runnel  down  the
center and holes  began  to  appear.   After  several  hundred  feet  I  got
uncomfortable and wanted out of the gully. I remembered Beckey  recommending
exiting the main gully (was this the  "main"  gully?)  to  the  rib  on  the
right. Problem was I couldn\'t see any reasonable exit  right  except  higher
where I really didn\'t want to go. I did see an exit left - or so I  thought.
Again it was much harder than it looked.  Nothing  more  than  class  3  but
nasty, nasty loose insecure rock. I  struggled  up  getting  more  and  more
freaked. I was stuck now as I didn\'t think I could safely  down  climb  this
stuff. So up I went. 600 feet of awful rock. I did not like it  at  all.  It
was very slow going as I carefully picked my way  up  testing  every  single
hold. Finally it eased and I topped out on  the  summit  ridge  at  a  small
cairn. Pt 8286 which I had marked as the summit on my GPS was  to  my  right
but this was obviously not the high point. That was to my  left  (which  the
map shows as 8280+ ft) and looked frightful. However, it was not as  bad  as
it looked.  In fact compared to what I  had  just  come  up  it  was  almost
pleasant. I reached the summit with its historic register of 1968  at  4:30.
Several parties had climbed it this year  with  Dave  Creeden  just  2  days
earlier. Interestingly almost every entry that came up the south side  as  I
did mentioned the horrible loose rock. Some even wondered if they  were  off
route and in the wrong gully. No  one  liked  it.  This  is  one  peak  that
deserves it terrible reputation.

Spider may have little to recommend it as  an  enjoyable  climb,  but  as  a
viewpoint it is superb. Expansive panoramas  in  every  direction  into  the
heart of the North Cascades and the Glacier Peak Wilderness. I  also  got  a
good look at my route of tomorrow. My but Old Guard and Sentinel looked  far
away!

Now to get off this pile of junk. No way was I going down  the  way  I  came
up. I thought I could find a better  way.  I  did  but  only  marginally.  I
followed the ridge toward Pt 8286 then  headed  down  easy  scree  into  the
gully to skiers left of the one I came up. I then exited  onto  the  rib  to
the left. This went well until the cliffs steepened near the bottom where  I
had to again pick my way carefully down zigzagging on ledges. Again  it  was
nasty and slow going but better I think than my way up.  Once  on  the  snow
slopes it was easy going back to camp at 7:00.

To Camp: 3 miles, 1600 ft and 3:50 hrs

To Spider: 2 miles, 1700 ft and 6 hrs RT

Sunday, August 21: Old Guard and Sentinel - I knew this would be a long  day
and it sure was. I started at 7:30 traversing easy snow around the  head  of
Flat Cr before starting a 1000 foot descent to Yang Yang Lakes. The day  was
partly cloudy which made for cool travel. Just before the lakes I  ran  into
a party of 8 coming out. They had camped at the lakes and climbed Old  Guard
and Le Conte. They gave me a valuable tip to climb Old Guard  via  the  snow
finger on the NW from col with Sentinel. They had first tried  it  from  the
NE and that didn\'t go.

The lakes were mostly melted out and would be  a  lovely  spot  to  camp.  I
followed trail from the lakes up a draw to a steep  snow  gully  leading  to
the ridge above. From there the way went down  slightly  to  Le  Conte  Pass
then up to below Le Conte Pk, then down to pass cliffs left  of  that  peak,
then up to the Le Conte Glacier. A lot of up and down. The glacier was  easy
going and no problem. This is a good year for solo  glacier  travel  as  few
crevasses have opened and those that have are easily  avoided.  However,  it
is not a good year for schrunds and moats. The schrund on Sentinel was  huge
and I would not be climbing it from this side. Old  Guard  though  was  easy
and a joy (in comparison to Spider) up the short  snow  finger  to  a  nifty
ledge and then broken rock on the NW slope. I reached  the  summit  at  1:45
(3350 ft, 6:15 hrs). No register (I left one).

Now for Sentinel. In order to climb this peak I would have  to  descend  and
cross over Sentinel Col to the upper part of the South Cascade  Glacier  and
traverse to the SW slope. This went well. Beckey mentions just  climbing  up
the SW slope and then following a ledge  left  and  finishing  on  the  west
slope. Sounds simple. I could see a broad easy looking  ledge  leading  left
from the top of the snow but when I got to it  I  couldn\'t  get  across  the
moat. I could see no alternate way in the vicinity to access this  ledge.  I
feared I was destined to fail on this peak. But before leaving I decided  to
try one other thing. It looked broken above the easy ledge. Maybe there  was
another way higher up - if I could get to it.

So I traversed farther right to the south ridge and began working my way  up
not really thinking it could possibly go as the rock was  quite  steep  with
several pinnacles. Yet I always found a way. The hardest part was a class  4
chimney. When I found an old rappel sling  at  the  top  I  was  encouraged.
Others had been this way. Below the  final  sheer  summit  wall  I  found  a
narrow ledge heading  down  to  above  the  lower  broad  ledge.  It  looked
feasible. Again looks can be deceiving. It was much harder than it looked  -
narrow, downsloping and very exposed. If I lost it I would  end  up  it  the
very moat that had stopped me below. The saving grace was  that  there  were
good handholds. But the whole  thing  was  very  scary  and  I  was  totally
freaked. The ledge got me to the west slope where  easy,  but  loose,  scree
led to the summit at 5:50 (4850 ft, 10:20 hrs). This whole detour  had  cost
me about 2 hours. On top I  found  a  matchbox  register  that  suspiciously
looked like a Jim Brisbine Special. It was and had been placed in 2005.

I took a few moments for photos and to collect myself before  heading  down.
I knew this was turning into another epic. My ledge was easier  on  the  way
back as it was uphill. I downclimbed the chimney to save  time  rather  than
set up a rappel. Then quickly down the snow and back to the Sentinel Col  at
7:10 and the base of the Le Conte Glacier at 7:45. Darkness caught me  below
Le Conte Pk. I had to descend the snow gully off  the  ridge  in  the  dark.
Maybe that helped as I couldn\'t see how steep it was. I  also  couldn\'t  see
the footsteps which didn\'t help. I got lost in the flat of Yang  Yang  Lakes
and had to use my GPS to find the trail. The  1000  ft  ascent  out  of  the
lakes went at half speed as I constantly lost the track. I ran  into  cliffs
I didn\'t know were there and used  my  GPS  constantly  to  correct  course.
Finally at 1:00 my headlamp picked up the reflective tape on  my  bivy  tent
and I was home.

Total: 14 miles, 7200 ft and 17:30 hrs.

Monday, August 22 - I felt surprisingly good considering. Up at 7:00 and  on
my way by 8:00. I had gotten a weather forecast via FM radio and it did  not
sound good - certain rain by  afternoon.  I  could  see  it  coming.  I  had
planned another camp at Kool-Aid Lake for a more leisurely trip but  because
of this I went all the way out and cut my trip short by a  day.  I  did  not
want to spend a night in the rain in a bivy  tent.   Rain  hit  just  beyond
Cache Col and continued steadily all the way to the TH at 5:00.

Total for day: 9.5 miles, 2000 ft and 9:00 hrs

Trip total: 35 miles and 15,900 ft in 4 days

Mtn Quad; and Bowan Mtn (7895 ft - P1655) - August 26-29, 2011

Most people climb McGregor Mtn via the trail up the  south  side.  I  credit
Paul Klenke with the idea for this different route on  the  north  side  via
the Sandalee Glacier.  It was certainly more interesting than the trail  and
I wouldn\'t have to take the boat to Stehekin and be tied  to  its  schedule,
which I dislike. Besides I wanted to combine  this  peak  with  Bowan  which
could be done from strategic Dans Camp.

Friday, August 26: To Dans Camps - Since I was only  planning  on  going  to
Dans Camp, an easy 9 miles on trail, much of it downhill, I got a  leisurely
start from the Bridge Creek TH at 1:30. This trail goes gently downhill  all
the way to Stehekin. I, however, cut off at the South Fork and the trail  to
Rainbow Lake at 6 miles. Here I discovered that one must ford Bridge  Creek.
The rangers didn\'t tell me this when I got my permit. No  matter,  the  ford
was quite easy, part on a stumpy log and the rest less than knee deep.  That
did mean, though, that I had to get my camp shoes wet and it  would  take  a
day to dry them out. I pulled into wooded Dans Camp at 6:00 with  plenty  of
time to set up camp. Although there is room here for several tents only  one
permit is allowed. There is a bear wire  (you  must  provide  the  cord),  a
toilet and a fire pit grill. Positively  luxurious  by  my  standards.  This
would be my home for three nights. Bugs were moderate.

Day Total: 9 miles, 900 ft and 4:30 hrs

Saturday, August 27: McGregor Mtn - Starting at 8:30  (I  know  -  a  rather
late start but I am getting lazy and slow  in my  dotage),  I  went  up  the
trail about .4 mile before plunging downhill toward the South  Fork.  I  was
vaguely following Klenke\'s directions from  SummitPost  but  ran  into  more
brush than he indicated. I don\'t seem to have his brush bashing  acumen  and
it took me well over an hour to find the crossing of the South  Fork,  which
I did on a spindly alder branch. Once  across  the  creek  open  forest  led
easily to  a  talus  slope  and  then  more  open  forest  that  provided  a
reasonable route above the brush clogged valley floor to a basin at 4600  ft
where I recrossed the creek. There I stayed low  on  talus  just  above  the
brush band and below cliffs to where I could access the First Gully.  Lovely
waterfalls decorated the way up as I climbed this gully, first on the  right
then on the left. Above the First Gully things leveled out to  the  base  of
the short Second Gully. There was  nothing  more  than  class  3  in  either
gully.

Above the Second Gully fun  broken  rock  led  to  the  snow  of  the  lower
Sandalee Glacier, a climb to the upper glacier and a  long  rising  traverse
to  below  the  north  buttress  of  McGregor,  pleasant  travel  all   with
increasing views. This side of McGregor has a distinctive alpine flavor  and
I was enjoying it all immensely. I had to drop slightly to bypass cliffs  of
the buttress before I could gain the west ridge at a steep cornice.  Here  I
ran into segments of the painted red arrow trail to the  top  but  much  was
still buried in snow. I topped out at the radio tower at 3:30  (4500  ft,  7
hrs).

I probably stayed longer than I should have on  the  spacious  sunny  summit
before heading down. The glacier segment went fast as  I  followed  snow  as
low as possible, all the way to the top of the  Second  Gully.  Then  things
went much more slowly. Nothing was difficult - it was just slow and  tedious
as I descended the rock and talus carefully. I reached  the  first  crossing
of South Creek at fading light. I was floundering in brush and  downed  logs
in the darkness trying to follow my morning route before giving up  on  that
idea and deciding to traverse higher above the creek even though this  meant
more elevation gain. This worked better as I encountered less brush.  I  hit
the trail about .2 mile from where I had left it and made camp at 9:00.

Day Total: 8 miles, 4800 ft and 12:30 hrs

Sunday, August 28: McGregor BM and Bowan Mtn - My main  goal  today  was  to
climb Bowan Mtn. I had no idea as to the route so I first went  up  McGregor
BM for a good view to figure one out. With another late  start  of  8:45,  I
hiked the Rainbow Lake Trail 3.3 miles to Rainbow Pass at 6200 ft,  followed
the ridge to Pt 6880 (I went around this point on the way back), dropped  to
the saddle on the other side and continued on the ridge  to  the  top  (3700
ft, 4:30 hrs)-all delightful travel. The summit gave me a splendid  view  of
Bowan but I  didn\'t  really  like  what  I  saw.  It  looked  difficult  and
unpleasant and I was running out of time and energy and  rapidly  losing  my
enthusiasm. Still I had to give it a try.

A route on the broken SW slope, just right of  a  major  gully,  to  the  SE
ridge looked like my best bet. The main question would be if  I  could  then
traverse the ridge to the summit area and find a way to the top. I  returned
to Rainbow Pass and followed the trail toward Rainbow Lake about Â½  mile  to
where it crossed the afore mentioned gully. Here I left the trail  at  3:30.
I knew I would be hard pressed to get up and down before dark.

Things started very well. The SW slope was  broken  and  easy  climbing.  In
fact there seemed to be a series of goat paths up. Then I made  the  mistake
of going all the way to the ridge at a notch.  Well  maybe  not  a  complete
mistake as there was snow at the notch and I was able to replenish my  water
supply which was rapidly being depleted on this very hot  day.  But  then  I
tried to follow the ridge crest and ran into impasses. It is best not to  go
all the way to the ridge but begin a traverse  100  feet  or  so  below  the
crest. This goes well until hitting a deep slot that must be  crossed  by  a
short down climb. On the other side lovely solid white slabs  in  a  shallow
depression led to the summit pinnacles. Here I made another  tactical  error
in climbing up too soon. I ran into some low class 4  here.  I  passed  over
two false summits before finally reaching  the  high  point,  naturally  the
farthest pinnacle. I found a cairn but no register (6000 ft, 9:45 hrs).

I reached the summit at 6:30and left at 6:45 staying  only  long  enough  to
leave a register and take a few pictures. I nailed the route down. There  is
really nothing harder than class 3 IF you go the  right  way.  I  found  the
whole climb much more fun than I expected and to be recommended. I  hit  the
trail just at dark (8:30). It was then I discovered how very tired I  really
was and I literally dragged back to camp at 11:00  with  every  part  of  my
body aching. It took me 2.5 hours to go 3.8 miles even though it was  mostly
downhill and all on trail. It didn\'t help  that  bugs  were  milling  around
attracted to my headlamp flying in my face and eyes and making it  difficult
to see. It was enough to drive a person insane.

Day Total: 12 miles, 6300 ft and 14:15 hrs

Monday, August 29 - I slept in till 8:00 and couldn\'t  get  my  body  moving
enough to leave until 10:30. The cold water of the Bridge  Creek  ford  felt
wonderful to tired muscles  and  sore  feet  but  the  uphill,  even  though
gentle, of the Bridge Creek Trail back to the car seemed to go  on  forever.
I really need a long rest.

Day Total: 9 miles, 1600 ft and 5:15 hrs

Trip Total: 38 miles and 13,600 ft in 4 days

Devils Tongue (8048 ft - P528) and Silver  Ridge  (6434  ft  -  P554)  -  Mt
Spickard Quad - September 9-11, 2011

Both heaven and hell. That best describes this trip. The  hell  started  the
minute  we  opened  the  car  doors  at  the  Chittenden  Bridge  and   were
immediately besieged by swarms of mosquitoes. We had to wait until the  next
day for heaven.

Friday, September 9 - We started from the Chittenden Bridge just before  the
US border on the Silver-Skagit Road at 11:20, elev  1600  ft  following  the
trail to Galene Lakes. This provided an easy way  across  the  Skagit  River
but added an extra 3 miles of trail along  the  river,  some  of  which  was
rough near the end. We knew there was a shortcut that connects  right  where
the trail heads uphill and eliminates these 3 miles but it required a  river
ford and we didn\'t know exactly where to access it. We did see the  junction
on the way up and vowed to use it on the way out.

The bugs were so bad right from the start that it didn\'t  take  long  before
we all covered up from head to toe despite  the  heat.  This  included  head
nets and, for me, gloves and a wind  shell  since  they  were  biting  right
through my long sleeved shirt. Repellant seemed to have little or no  effect
on these voracious little beasts. We hoped we would get above the bugs  once
we started climbing but, other than a  short  respite  midway  up  in  mossy
forest, that did not happen. If anything they got worse as  we  got  higher,
something we didn\'t think was possible at the time.

The trail was easily followed and in pretty good shape except for  a  couple
of creek washouts. It became slightly  brushy  as  the  forest  thinned.  We
pulled into Middle Galene Lake at 5:50 but  the  bugs  were  still  bad  so,
thinking they might get better, we pushed on  to  Upper  Galene  Lake  (elev
6000 ft) arriving at 7:00.  They didn\'t. It anything they were worse but  we
did find a nice spot to camp. I have never seen bugs this  bad  that  lasted
over such a wide elevation range in all my years of  climbing.  It  reminded
me of the nightmare stories I have read about the mosquitoes in  the  Alaska
tundra. Needless to say it put a damper on the enjoyment of the evening.  No
washing up in the lake. No lounging around a leisurely dinner (ever  try  to
eat with a head net on?). We all did the  minimum  necessary  chores  before
retreating to the protection of the netting of our shelters.

Total: 10 miles, 4900 ft and 7:30 hrs

Saturday, September 10 - The bugs  semi-retired  shortly  after  we  did  at
night but were at it again with as much  malevolence  as  ever  as  soon  we
emerged from our sleeping bags at 6:00.  This  gave  no  incentive  to  hang
around camp but also slowed us in getting ready so  we  didn\'t  leave  until
7:30. We quickly climbed to the ridge above the lake and gradually made  the
transition from hell to heaven. The scenery was heaven from the get go  with
gorgeous meadows and views, but it took a while to get  above  bug  hell.  I
had no good Canadian maps, either hardcopy or  on  my  GPS,  and  so  was  a
little fuzzy as to how much up and down there was to the route. There  ended
up being a lot more than I expected. We followed  the  ridge  taking  a  big
drop (about 800 ft) to Monument 70 on the border. Then  it  was  up  to  the
5840 ft saddle on Silver Ridge and then up and down along  the  broad  crest
to Pt 6545. Somewhere in here we entered true heaven.  Head  nets  came  off
and joy returned to our steps as we  rambled  along  this  truly  delightful
ridge with the even present vista of attractive Devils Tongue and  neighbors
in front of us. This is what we came for.

More up and down along the gentle ridge brought  us  to  Pt  7103  which  we
turned on a left  slanting  ramp  that  ended  at  a  very  unpleasant,  but
blessedly short, loose gully to the top. Another drop from  Pt  7103  and  a
downward traverse on talus led to snow, a broad bench left to  the  base  of
the broken SE summit ridge and about 800 feet of  extremely  pleasant  solid
class 3 scrambling on a nifty series of ledges. I was having so much  fun  I
was almost sorry to reach the summit at 2:30  (3800  ft,  7  hrs).  Spickard
towered above sparkling Silver Lake. This  is  a  side  of  the  Chilliwacks
seldom seen.

We spent over an hour on the summit. Oddly I found a  lone  scrap  of  paper
recording an ascent from 2008 that had somehow survived its removal  from  a
film can (we found the lid  but  not  the  body).  I  added  it  to  my  new
register. We slowly retraced our steps savoring  every  minute  (except  the
loose gully off Pt 7103). No one was in a hurry to get back  to  camp  early
and fight the insect hordes so when Mike suggested we take the short  detour
to Pk 6434 on Silver Ridge no one objected too  strongly.  We  reached  that
summit just at dark to a  dazzling  full  moon  (5300  ft,  12:15  hrs).  We
wandered a bit getting off Silver Ridge as both Mike\'s and my GPS  were  not
functional (my batteries were dead - I need to  get  new  ones  as  they  no
longer hold a charge for very long). However, reverting to  Jim\'s  low  tech
but reliable compass we managed to come out right at Monument  70.  Then  it
was just the final climb from there. We arrived in camp  at  9:30  with  the
bugs semi-retired again, good timing from that point of view.

Total: 10 miles, 6000 ft and 14 hrs.

Sunday, September 11 - We were up at 7:00 and left at 8:30 with bugs  at  us
immediately. We hiked  out  the  whole  way  in  head  nets  and  protective
clothing. We did take the shortcut and ford across the Skagit River. It  was
not fast but it was up to my waist and I was happy to have Jim to hang  onto
in the deepest part. The trail came out on the  Silver-Skagit  Road  at  the
Nepopekum Day Use Area 3.5 miles before the Chittenden  Bridge.  Jim  jogged
back to the car in an hour while Mike and I hunkered down  under  cover.  We
chatted with a local fisherman who had been  coming  to  this  area  for  20
years and had never seen the bugs this  bad  before.  When  Jim  returned  I
could barely stand to strip long enough to change clothes.  During  the  few
minutes that took I endured dozens of new bites and was driven to the  brink
of insanity. My tolerance for the hungry devils had completely surpassed  my
limit. I will have buzzing nightmares for weeks to  come  and  although  the
climb itself was wonderful and I wouldn\'t have missed it for  the  world  my
hope is to never again encounter such horrific swarms of insects.

Day Total: 8 miles 300 ft and 4:30 hrs

I had wanted to hike the trail from  Deer  Park  to  Obstruction  Point  for
years but other harder trips always took precedence. It is a long drive  for
a relatively easy trail trip. With me recently slowed by an  overuse  injury
the time now seemed right. In fact I couldn\'t  have  timed  it  better.  The
Olympic National Park website stated Deer  Park  was  to  close  on  Sunday,
October 16 but when I called the  Wilderness  Center  the  recorded  message
said it was still open. I doubted it would be open much longer  (little  did
I know how little longer). I had a forecast of one day of  good  weather  on
Wednesday with rain coming in on Thursday. It was  now  or  never  for  this
year.

Wednesday, October 19: Green Mtn, Maiden Peak and Elk Mtn - When  I  arrived
at the TH at 11:30 it was a lovely sunny day. The trail  began  by  dropping
400 ft and then following the wooded ridge to Green Mtn. I  took  the  short
detour to that summit before continuing on toward Maiden  Pk.  Shortly  past
Green Mtn the trail entered  lovely  meadows  with  expansive  views.  After
rounding Pt 6319 I headed up open terrain to the summit of Maiden  Pk  where
I ate my lunch in the sun (1750 ft, 2:45 hr).

It had been my intention to stop at  Maiden  Pk  as  I  wanted  to  keep  my
elevation gain between 2-3000 ft. Elevation is bad  for  my  injured  muscle
and I didn\'t want to stress it. But it was still early  and  everything  was
so beautiful I just couldn\'t stop. I am not known for self  control.  So  of
course I had to continue on  to  Elk  Mtn  along  the  beautiful  ridge.  My
favorite thing in the mountains is rambling along ridges so I took  my  time
and savored every moment. Clouds were beginning  to  form  but  rather  than
detracting from the views they added spectacular effects.

From Maiden Pk the trail dropped about 400 ft to a saddle and Roaring  Winds
Camp. Fortunately it did not live up to its name this day. It would  make  a
lovely place to camp but there is no water  source  after  the  snow  melts.
From the saddle the trail climbed steeply onto  the  broad  plateau  of  Elk
Mtn. There was some drifted  snow  here.  The  highest  point  was  a  rocky
promontory at the west end of the ridge (6 miles, 2700 ft, 5 hrs).

I left Elk Mtn at 5:00. Obviously I wasn\'t going to make it back to the  car
before dark but I didn\'t mind. The night was beautiful and I  was  going  to
car camp at Deer Park and so was in no hurry. At one point I even laid  down
to rest my poor leg. I had a few sprinkles of rain before  reaching  the  TH
at 8:30 (12.5 miles, 3500 ft, 8:30 hrs)

I was all alone in the campground and had the  pick  of  campsites.  In  the
dark I couldn\'t really see much but the next morning I discovered Deer  Park
is a fantastic place to  camp.  It  is  located  in  a  silver  forest  with
marvelous views. There are two large shelters for inclement weather.  And  I
got to camp for free as all the pay  envelopes  had  already  been  removed.
However the outhouse was still unlocked and still stocked with TP. Nice.

Thursday, October 20: Blue Mtn and Deer Ridge -  It  rained  lightly  during
the night and I fully expected to wake up to  the  forecast  rain  and  fog.
Instead I found sunshine and views. How lucky was that! I  had  intended  to
take the short (.5 mile, 165 ft,:19 hr) loop  hike  up  Blue  Mtn  and  then
leave but the day was so beautiful how could I? So I hiked  the  Deer  Ridge
trail toward Slab Camp and the Gray Wolf River until  it  plunged  into  the
forest. More ridge rambling and lovely meadows. I returned  to  the  car  at
2:00 by which time the forecast was beginning to come true and I was in  fog
(5 miles, 1250 ft, 3:45 hrs). I ended up  doing  much  more  elevation  gain
than I had wanted (5000 ft for the 2 days) but I took it slow and  easy  and
had minimal repercussions. And it was SO worth it.

Just as I was leaving I ran into a park ranger. He told me  he  was  closing
Deer Park for the season. He had thought to close it the day before but  the
weather was so nice he decided against it. Wow! He  said  the  gate  at  the
park entrance (7.7 miles down) was closed but not locked.  I  would  be  the
last person to leave. Talk about timing.

Tuesday, November 1 - Because of commitments I  was  unable  to  leave  town
until 1:30 but I figured I could still make it to  my  planned  campsite  on
Dog Cr by dark. I really wanted to squeeze in one more overnight before  the
snows hit. I had thought I was past the general deer season but as  I  drove
up Road 1500 and 1502 from Nile east of Chinook Pass it was  obvious  I  had
totally misinterpreted  the  schedules.  Hunters  occupied  every  nook  and
cranny and I soon learned it was now elk season. One  runs  into  the  other
and there is no avoiding hunters this time of year. Darn! Oh well, they  all
seemed friendly, even protective when they learned I was alone  and  once  I
hit the East Mt Aix Trail I ran into only two hunters coming out just  as  I
was going in. I saw no one else the rest of the trip. Still I was very  glad
I had brought my bright orange windbreaker along.

I started on the trail at 4:30 and easily hiked the trail up  to  Buck  Lake
and down to Dog Creek. I was pleasantly surprised to find that  the  western
larches were near their peak of color. I thought I had missed most of  larch
season. I arrived at the creek with just enough light to find the nice  camp
at the junction with the Richmond Mine Trail. By the time I set up  my  tent
it was pitch dark and well below freezing and I wanted nothing more than  to
retreat to my warm sleeping bag.

3.5 miles, 600 ft, 1:50 hrs

Wednesday, November 2: Nelson Butte, Pk 7146 & Pk 7041 - It is  so  hard  to
get moving in the morning when it doesn\'t  get  light  until  7:30  and  the
temperature is 25 degrees. But it was a sunny day and the sun  even  hit  my
tent by the time I started at 9:20 so I  warmed  quickly.  I  began  on  the
Richmond Mine Trail until it began to veer away from Nelson Butte  at  about
5600 ft, then went up easy open slopes to hit the  summit  ridge.  The  last
bit along the  ridge  was  tedious  talus  that  I  was  thinking  would  be
treacherous if wet, icy or covered with fresh snow. Fortunately I  had  none
of that. But I did have a howling frigid wind strong enough to blow  me  off
balance. I reached the summit at 12:50 (3000 ft, 3:30  hrs).  Too  windy  on
top I found a protective sunny spot for lunch down the ridge a ways.

I then followed the ridge down to the saddle  with  Pk  7146.  I  must  have
crossed the Richmond Mine Trail somewhere in here but I  never  noticed  it.
Many of the trails in this area are lightly used  and  somewhat  obscure  in
places, especially meadows. But I did find a nice elk trail that led to  the
basin NE of Pk 7146. Here I ran into  some  intermittent  old  snow  on  the
steepening hillside. I found the snow gave better footing  than  the  frozen
ground. I topped out on the summit at 3:00 (3850 ft, 5:40 hrs).

I had planned to end the day here, return to camp  and  climb  Pk  7041  the
next day via the Mt Aix Trail. But the weather was holding, I  had  3  hours
of daylight left and I was still feeling good. I was also worried  that  the
snow predicted to come in during  the  night  would  make  travel  difficult
tomorrow. I thought I could make a high traverse below  Mt  Aix  around  the
head of Dog Creek, save some 2000 ft of elevation gain and get all three  of
my peaks in one day. This plan sounded better in concept than  it  ended  up
being in execution. Of course it was longer than it  appeared,  I  ran  into
unforeseen difficulties and I had to  drop  farther  than  expected  and  so
maybe saved only 1500 ft of gain. But it was a grand  and  interesting  loop
traverse route.

At one point I came to an "ice stream".  This  was  more  than  your  normal
frozen creek, but literally a solid sheet of water ice that I doubt I  could
have crossed with ice axe and crampons, neither of which I  had.  I  had  to
climb 100 feet to get to a level spot above where  the  ice  was  broken  by
tuffs of meadow. Even then I slipped, fell a few  feet  and  lost  one  pole
which skittered down the ice out of sight. I made it  across  to  the  other
side and went downhill until I could see my pole but darn if  it  wasn\'t  on
the opposite side of the ice stream from me. I was not going to cross  again
to get it. Better to abandon my pole than chance another slip.

I encountered no more ice but the ground was  frozen  solid  everywhere  and
make for bad footing. Eventually I worked my way around Mt Aix up  and  down
past cliffs until I could climb to the ridge with Pk 7041. I was now on  the
more gentle south side where the sun had thawed the ground and I could  move
much more easily and quickly. I raced the  setting  sun  to  arrive  on  the
summit of Pk 7041 at 6:00 (5350 ft, 8:50 hrs). After leaving a  register,  I
quickly left to plunge straight downhill worried  that  in  the  encroaching
darkness I would miss the Mt Aix trail. I  might  have  too  except  I  came
right out at the junction with the Lookout Creek Trail with  signs  pointing
the way. At this point I  felt  I  could  take  a  short  rest  then  slowly
followed the trail the rest of the way to  camp  by  headlamp,  arriving  at
8:40.

Total for day: 11 miles, 5500 ft and 11:20 hrs

Thursday, November 3 - The predicted snowstorm never amounted  to  much  and
all I got was a  dusting  overnight.  It  was  even  partial  sunny  in  the
morning. Tired, I slept in until 8:30 and didn\'t leave until 10:30  reaching
the TH at 12:30 (3.5 miles, 600 ft, 2 hrs).

Total for trip: 18 miles and 6700 ft in 3 days.

Meeks Table (4480+ ft - P240 - Meeks Table Quad) - On the drive  out  I  had
time to take the short trail to Meeks Table. This high plateau is  protected
by cliffs and as such is a fascinating preserved ecosystem  that  has  never
been disturbed by grazing. It is well worth a visit. It also  gave  a  great
view of where I just been and was a fitting end to a lovely trip.

2.2 miles, 700 ft, 1:35 hrs

While I only got a dusting of snow Chinook Pass had several inches  although
the road was bare and wet by the time I drove over.

"Tubal Cain Pk" (6628 ft - P708 - Mt Townsend Quad) - November 6-7, 2011

Sunday, November 6 - Although this peak could be done in a day, the  longish
drive and short days made an overnighter with a  camp  at  Tubal  Cain  more
appealing to me. To this end I hiked the easy Tubal  Cain  Trail  3.5  miles
and 1100 ft to the camp area arriving before  noon  (2  hrs).  There  was  a
dusting of fresh snow on the rhododendrons in the semi  open  at  the  start
but oddly this diminished as I climbed higher into denser  woods  and  there
was virtually no snow where I set up my tent. However  the  temperature  was
well below freezing, never rising above that level either  day,  and  I  had
some trouble getting stakes into the hard ground.

By 1:00 I was ready to start for my peak. I crossed Copper Cr and  continued
about 1.5 miles on the trail before finding a suitable spot to leave  it  to
head uphill. The slope above the trail was continuously steep and  not  very
appealing for XC travel before this point. I worked my way  up  on  a  right
diagonal until past cliffs then straight  up  into  a  shallow  basin.  From
there I again went diagonally right until almost  to  the  rocky  NE  ridge,
then went up and left below the cliffs until I  could  gain  the  ridge  and
cross over it to the broad flat summit plateau. Here I ran into  some  snow.
The whole route was quite interesting but nothing more than  class  2.  This
summit plateau brought to mind the descriptive  name  "Lost  World  Plateau"
and just being there was worth the  price  of  admission.  The  view  itself
seemed from another world, especially with the clouds coming and going.  The
actual summit (2400 ft, 3 hrs) was a small rock  outcrop  where  I  built  a
cairn for a register before leaving after 20 minutes on top.

I wandered the plateau to the south on the way  down  but  didn\'t  like  the
looks of possible cliffs below in that direction so  decided  to  head  back
north toward my up route.  After  that  little  detour  I  was  able  to  go
straight down, much of the way on easy plungeable scree, to  the  trail  and
save considerable time.  I  saved  more  time  by  cutting  the  long  trail
switchback and made it back to camp at 5:30 (4 miles, 2500 ft, 4:30 hrs).

Monday, November 7 - I arose at 8:00, more than ready to  move  after  14.5
hrs in the tent. Before packing up and leaving I explored around  the  area.
I found dozens of delightful places to camp in the bouldery forest.  I  also
found the trail to the main Tubal Cain mine about 100 feet above  the  camp.
The tunnel went back as far as I could see into solid  rock.  I  would  have
liked to have gone to the end but the  floor  was  flooded  with  a  running
stream, in places over the top of my boots, and I  didn\'t  want  to  get  my
feet wet on this cold day. I will save that for a warmer day  when  I  won\'t
mind wading.

I finally left at 10:30 for the short hike out (3.5 miles, 1:30 hrs).

Total for trip: 11 miles and 3800 ft in 2 days

This trip was all about deep  mossy  forest,  big  trees,  wild  creeks  and
spectacular waterfalls (with three easy peaks thrown in for  good  measure).
I had no idea Siouxon Creek was so beautiful. I was totally  blown  away  by
it. If it has not yet been designated a Wild and Scenic River  it  certainly
should be. We peakbaggers sometimes don\'t  fully  appreciate  lowland  river
valleys in our pursuit of highland goals. This valley  makes  for  a  worthy
destination in its own right.  It  is  particularly  suitable  for  the  off
season where rain only adds to the volume of the creeks  and  falls  and  to
the greenness of the vegetation. And to camp within sight and sound  of  the
rushing water is a rewarding experience. The only caveat is that  the  trail
is open to mountain bikers and popular with them on summer weekends. But  go
midweek during the late fall as I did and chances  are  encounters  will  be
few. I only met one.

Wednesday, November 14 - I began from the Upper Siouxon TH which is  at  the
end of Rd 5701, elevation 1350 ft. It was drizzling lightly  but  that  soon
ended. This was the final day of elk season and as I was getting  ready  two
hunters returned to the only other vehicle parked. I  had  a  friendly  chat
with them before starting. Trail 130 began by descending  200  feet  to  the
creek bottom in lovely forest. Being  up  to  mountain  bike  standards  the
tread was wide and smooth and gentle, suitable for toddlers and  old  ladies
alike. The way is always in sight of scenic  Siouxon  Creek  with  its  many
small cascades and waterfalls  and  inviting  campsites  abound  everywhere.
Almost immediately West Creek is crossed. At 1.2 miles is the side trail  up
Horseshoe Ridge. At 1.7 miles is Horseshoe Creek and Falls.  At  3  miles  I
came to the Wildcat Trail 159 junction, my  intended  destination  and  camp
for the day. But I was shocked to find no bridge  across  the  Siouxon.  All
accounts I had read indicated there was a bridge and I fully  expected  one.
This sure put a kink in my plan to access my peaks via that trail.  What  to
do now?

While mulling over my options I set up  camp  in  a  choice  spot  near  the
junction, elevation 1400  ft.  If  all  else  failed  I  could  just  go  up
Horseshoe Ridge on loop Trail 140. In checking out the creek I found no  log
anywhere. Mindful that water  is  always  deeper  than  it  looks,  I  still
concluded a ford was possible but not desirable and since I had not  brought
wading shoes (who knew they would be needed?)  it  would  mean  starting  my
climb in wet boots (I cannot wade a big creek  barefoot).  Then  looking  at
the map I saw that by taking Chinook Trail 130 A  I  could  also  access  my
peaks, although this would be longer by several miles. But for that  I  also
had to cross the Siouxon and, in addition, Chinook Creek.  To  see  if  this
was possible I used the rest of the afternoon to hike  the  additional  mile
upstream to the Chinook Trail junction. I was delighted  to  find  a  sturdy
bridge across the Siouxon and  an  excellent  trail  leading  to  impressive
Chinook Falls. There was also a log across  Chinook  Creek  just  below  the
falls. My plan was set for the following day.

To camp at Wildcat Junction: 3 miles, 400 ft and 1:30 hrs

Chinook Falls: 2 miles, 250 ft and 1:10 hrs RT

Thursday, November 15 - I returned the mile to Chinook Trail 130  A  in  the
morning and crawled the slick wet log over Chinook Creek.  I  was  not  sure
what condition the trail would be on the other side as I was  sure  the  log
would deter many hikers.  I  was  happy  to  find  that  while  not  up  the
standards of main Trail  130  it  was  in  very  good  shape.  It  began  by
traversing downstream a short ways and then  switchbacking  upstream  again.
At the switchback was a junction and sign indicating a  side  trail  led  to
Wildcat Trail 159. This was a total surprise. This trail is not  on  any  of
my maps and not mentioned in any books. I surmised that this  was  a  cutoff
trail that provided access to Trail 159 when the bridge at the main  Wildcat
Junction is out. It makes for a 2 mile detour. I almost changed plans  again
and took it but I knew I would also have to  cross  Wildcat  Creek  and  was
worried that could be a problem. So I stuck with the plan  to  hike  up  the
Chinook Trail. Besides I liked the idea of a big loop by  returning  on  the
Wildcat Trail. After about 2 miles the trail morphed into a  road/trail.  At
3.5 miles I hit the end of  drivable  Road  6403  where  another  road/trail
(listed as Trail 129) became true trail again  at  5  miles.  Here  I  began
running into snow and came across unmistakable fairly  fresh  cougar  tracks
which stayed with me all the way to the short spur  trail  up  Siouxon  Peak
(6.5 miles from camp, 3100 ft, 4 hrs).

The day was mostly sunny but clouds hung over the  high  peaks  and  distant
views were limited from this old lookout site. There was a brutal cold  wind
that forced me to eat my lunch  on  the  lee  side  of  the  slope.  I  soon
continued downhill along the wooded ridge following Huffman  Trail  129.  It
was in good shape with only a few minor blow downs. At mile 7.5  I  came  to
the upper junction of Wildcat Trail 156. This was to be my  intended  return
route. I stayed with Trail 129 another  1.5  miles,  passing  below  Huffman
Peak, to the junction with Trail 126 where I went cross-country up the  easy
ridge to the summit of the SW Peak of Huffman (10 miles, 3800  ft,  6  hrs).
This had a cute little open top with a nice view into the Siouxon Valley.

I returned to Trail 129 following it back toward Huffman Peak until I saw  a
reasonable way up the steep NW slope to the rocky  summit  (11  miles,  4450
ft, 7:40 hrs). This time I had some reasonable  distant  views  although  Mt
Adams remained shy. Since this also was an old lookout  site,  there  should
have been a trail up this peak and some books  imply  there  is  one  but  I
found none. It has likely disappeared. The easiest way  up  is  via  the  NE
ridge, the way I went down. I reached the Wildcat  Trail  junction  at  4:20
with little daylight left. There the trail annoyingly climbed 200 feet  over
a knoll before plunging down the ridge line. I had hoped to get  to  Wildcat
Falls with enough light left to view it and take photos but darkness  caught
me well before making it that far. I could feel the spray, hear the roar  of
the water and barely make out a  giant  wall  of  gushing  white  so  I  was
greatly disappointed to miss seeing what had to be a spectacular  waterfall.


A half mile past the falls the trail ended on the bank of  the  Siouxon.  It
was 6:00 and very dark. What to do now? I could look for  the  cutoff  trail
and take the 2 mile detour. But I didn\'t know where to  pick  it  up  and  I
would still have to cross Wildcat Creek. On  the  other  hand  my  camp  was
directly across the creek from me only a few hundred feet away. The lure  of
my tent so close was too great. Without thinking too much more and before  I
changed my mind I plunged into the water. I didn\'t even stop to  remove  any
clothing. I am sure there were shallower places to cross but in the  dark  I
managed to find a spot that was hip deep. I really didn\'t think it would  be
that deep. But I stayed upright and made it across. It all happened so  fast
I didn\'t have time to get cold. And since my tent was right there,  I  could
immediately change into dry clothing and crawl into my cozy sleeping bag.  I
did make a hot water bottle to warm my feet.

Day Total: 15 miles, 4750 ft and 10:25 hrs

Friday, November 16 - The day dawned  sunny  and  the  rain  held  off  till
afternoon which gave me time and incentive to make  a  return  trip  to  see
Wildcat Falls, which I had felt cheated to miss. I also wanted to check  out
the cutoff trail. Despite hanging them on a line overnight, my wet  climbing
pants had not dried much in the high humidity. So  I  hiked  in  rain  pants
over long johns. That was quite comfortable. My boots were  another  matter.
I had left them upside down to drain but they too were still soggy. As  soon
as I put them on they saturated my dry socks. I would just have  to  put  up
with that. I still had one more dry pair  for  the  trip  out.  So  back  to
Chinook Falls I went once again and across the log over Chinook Creek  where
I picked up the cutoff trail. I found this trail to be very good and by  the
look of the mossy cut logs very old. Either the bridge has been out  a  long
time or is washed out frequently. There was a log crossing of Wildcat  Creek
but it also was wet and slick. The junction with the main Wildcat Trail  was
obvious and even signed. How I had missed it the night before I don\'t  know.
No matter, I don\'t think I would  have  wanted  to  do  either  of  the  log
crossings in the dark not to mention the  extra  2  miles  and,  all  things
considered, the ford was really the lesser of two evils.

I hiked back up the trail Â½ mile to Wildcat Falls.  As  I  expected  it  was
well worth the effort. Of all the waterfalls it was  the  most  spectacular,
free falling for well over a hundred feet. I stayed a good half hour  taking
pictures and absorbing the energy.

To Wildcat Falls: 3 miles, 750 ft and 2:50 hrs RT

Hike out: 3 miles, 400 ft and 1:30 hr

Trip Total: 26 miles and 6550 ft in 3 days

April Pk (6356 ft - P396 - Mt Townsend Quad) - December 5-7, 2011

Monday, December 5 - I wanted to try for this peak while  access  was  still
possible. I only wanted to get to the Tunnel Creek Shelter the first day  to
allow a full day for climbing the peak so to fill the  rest  of  the  day  I
went up Pk 1441 (P441) and Little Skidder Hill (P371) on  the  nearby  Uncas
Quad. Neither is worth saying much about but they did  accomplish  the  goal
of entertaining me for a few hours and not get me to  the  Tunnel  Creek  TH
too early.

The road was clear except very near the  TH  where  all  of  sudden  some  8
inches of sugar snow appeared in the open parking area and caused me to  get
briefly stuck turning around. By the time  I  got  unstuck  and  got  myself
ready to go it was 3:00, an hour later than planned. The  first  0.75  mile  of
trail was quite slick with a thin covering of icy snow.  It  made  me  think
about putting crampons on but I never took the time. The middle  section  of
trail away from the creek and higher on the hillside was almost  snow  free.
The last mile the snow gradually  got  deeper  until  there  was  continuous
coverage.

I was surprised to find another car parked at the TH. What  on  earth  would
anyone else be doing here? As it got later and  still  no  one  came  out  I
became convinced they were also spending the night. Maybe they would  be  at
the shelter and I would have company. That would entertain more  hours.  But
alas, as darkness was descending I ran into two fellows and a dog. We had  a
nice chat. They had gone no farther than the bridge just  past  the  shelter
and got caught up photographing icicles  along  the  creek.  One  carried  a
large tripod. They were from Kingston and often came  up  this  trail.  They
expressed some concern about going down the last section of trail that  they
too had found slick and icy. From the passionate way  they  talked  I  could
tell they were enchanted with the  beauty  of  winter  in  the  forest.  But
climbers they were not. I don\'t think they knew of April Pk or where  I  was
headed.

I reached the shelter at 5:20 hiking the last bit by moonlight.  The  almost
full moon was high in the sky and gave off a surprising amount of  light  on
the trail. Despite the shelter being in good condition, since I  had  lugged
it along (just in case) I set up my tent on the bare  floor.  I  thought  it
would be warmer. By the time I did all my chores, ate dinner and  watched  a
video it was 9:00 and late enough to go to sleep.

Total for day: 3 miles, 1400 ft and 2:20 hrs

Tuesday, December 6 - One disadvantage of being in a tent inside  a  shelter
is that it is very dark and I couldn\'t really tell when it got  light  until
I emerged from both. That led to a somewhat late start of 8:00.  Then  again
I really didn\'t want to get going much earlier. I continued on the  trail  a
short ways until it crossed Tunnel Creek at the  confluence  of  two  forks.
Here I found a flagged way trail that followed along the right hand fork  to
an open lower basin. I got  an  omen  of  things  to  come  by  encountering
slowing calf deep snow. I lost the flags in the forest  on  the  other  side
and ended up heading too far right and getting too high. I  had  to  contour
steep hillside to get back on track. More lost time.  Then  I  came  to  the
large middle basin and my pace slowed to a  crawl.  I  inconsistently  broke
through  crust  into  knee  deep  sugar  snow  while  winding  through  huge
boulders. Very slow and exhausting.

Once across the middle basin I began  climbing  a  broad  gully  toward  the
March-April col. The inconsistent snow continued with the soft  crust  being
replaced by a hard icy one. Even more exhausting going uphill. At this  rate
I wondered if I was ever going to make it  before  dark.  I  began  thinking
there was a good reason my peak was named "April" - it would be much  better
to climb it in April than December.

I finally reached the col and blessed  sunshine  at  12:45  (2350  ft,  4:45
hrs). It was a beautiful day but up to  now  I  had  been  entirely  in  the
shade. However things were still not looking all  that  good.  According  to
the Olympic Mountains: A Climbing Guide, from the col the route goes up  and
left on a ledge to the summit ridge, class 3.  I  always  get  nervous  when
this guide calls something class  3  as  it  is  notorious  for  underrating
difficulty. Class 3 could very well be close to class 4 and  perhaps  beyond
me under the present conditions of snow and ice.

I took a much needed rest to soak up the warmth  while  I  mulled  over  the
situation. I could see  nothing  I  wanted  to  tackle  on  the  rock  cliff
directly above the col.  But I saw the tracks of  a  mountain  goat  heading
down the other side of the col and up an impossibly steep looking snow  ramp
bypassing the cliff. Mountain goats are smart critters  and  know  the  easy
ways to go. Perhaps there was something beyond that. Sure enough,  the  snow
ramp wasn\'t as steep as it looked and on the other side was a  hidden  gully
that looked reasonable. It was steep (when I bump my knees stepping up  that
means over 45 degrees) and icy enough (I was in  the  shade  again)  that  I
wished I had stopped to put on crampons (I didn\'t and  had  to  chop  a  few
steps because of that), but I made it up.

When I reached the summit ridge I had my first view of Mt Constance and  its
surroundings.  What a wild beautiful peak! The last bit to the top was  easy
and I reached the summit  at  2:20  (2900  ft,  6:20  hrs)  having  had  the
distinction of more than doubling the guidebook time of  3  hours  from  the
shelter. I found a nice register that had been placed in 2007. It  had  only
one entry. I guess this peak isn\'t climbed all that often. I only  know  for
sure of one person who has done it, Mike Torok, but he  must  have  done  it
pre 2007 since his name wasn\'t in the register.

It was sunny and warm on the summit and I squeezed out as  much  time  as  I
dared enjoying my scenic perch before plunging back down into the  shade.  I
left a little after 3:00. I did put crampons on for the down climb and  left
them on all the way back to the shelter. It sure helped having my  track  to
follow although I still broke through in some new places to over  my  knees.
Darkness overtook me at the lower basin and my headlamp was  needed  in  the
forest despite the full moon. I reached the shelter at 6:00.

Total for day: 4 miles, 3000 ft and 10 hrs

Wednesday, December 7 - All I had to do today  was  hike  out  3  miles  and
drive home so I was in no hurry. I left at 9:45. I did put crampons  on  for
the last icy bit of the trail and was glad I did.

Trip Total: 10 miles and 4400 ft in 3 days

Puyallup LO (4877 ft - P557 - Ashford Quad) - December 31,  2011  -  January
1, 2012

Saturday, December 31 - I had an uncontrollable urge to see the New Year  in
from a snow camp and chose this peak as my destination. I  had  long  wanted
to ski up it but it is 10 miles one way from the Copper Creek  SnoPark,  too
long for a reasonable day trip. It would have been nice to spend  the  night
at the Copper Creek Hut but it  was  full,  not  surprising  for  a  holiday
weekend, so it would be tent camping for me.

Road 92, the north access to the Mt Tahoma Trail  System  and  Copper  Creek
Hut, is now permanently gated at the former middle SnoPark,  elevation  3240
ft, regardless of snow level. The last time I was here one  could  drive  to
the upper SnoPark, elevation 3500 ft. The road is still  perfectly  drivable
so I am not sure why this is so. Whatever the reason this adds 1.1 miles  to
the distance. More to the point this must often be walked as the snow  cover
is frequently marginal in this section. I was lucky this  day  and  had  1-2
inches of lovely fresh powder snow that allowed skiing from the start but  I
knew it was unlikely to remain so until my return.

The snow cover remained thin until hitting grooming  which  started  at  the
Valley Vista junction about 2.75 miles in. I met many people coming out  from
the hut, most on foot or snowshoes. I  bypassed  the  junction  to  the  hut
opting to head straight for my desired camp. Since I  was  carrying  a  tent
anyway I wanted to get a bit closer to my peak as the LO is  still  6  miles
from the hut. I soon came to another junction where  I  was  pretty  sure  I
should go left downhill on an untracked road to some  small  lakes  but  the
grooming went right uphill. There was no trail sign  to  help  out.  My  map
didn\'t show a connection to the LO road this way but my map  is  not  up  to
date and doesn\'t show many of the current maze of roads in the area.  And  I
really thought the grooming went all the way to the LO. Well it  didn\'t.  It
dead-ended at a viewpoint on the ridge. It would have been easier for me  to
retrace my steps back to the untracked road to the lakes, but  when  have  I
been known to ever do the easy thing?

 Instead I forced a way off the  ridge  down  steep  terrain  through  thick
trees, not terribly easy with a full pack. I did manage to stay  upright  by
going very slowly but it took the better part of an hour to  reach  a  lower
road that then led to a suitable campsite on  a  minor  saddle  (elev  4400)
with a view of Mt Rainier (7.5 miles, 2000 ft, 5:15 hrs).  I  set  up  camp,
ate dinner and then went on an evening tour on a spur road that  went  above
the lakes. It was a beautiful night  with  a  quarter  moon  and  delightful
snow. Pure magic. I returned to camp, watched a video and  took  a  nap.  At
11:30 I awoke in time to toast the New  Year  with  Irish  CrÃ¨me  laced  hot
chocolate. I could hear fireworks from civilization  in  the  valley  below.
Not a bad end to 2011.

Sunday, January1 - I could feel the temperature rising during the night  and
the wind picking up. By the time I got going at 8:00 it  was  near  freezing
and all my beautiful powder was beginning to melt or had  been  blown  away.
But it was still quite good skiing. I had skied down to a junction  slightly
below my camp the day before where a puzzling sign  pointed  both  left  and
right to Puyallup LO. This confused me. After studying the map  I  concluded
there were two routes, one a  lower  one  and  one  an  upper  ridge  route.
Naturally I chose the ridge route, despite  the  somewhat  windy  conditions
and some added elevation gain, as anyone who knows me knows I love ridges.

The skiing was delightful along the ridge road.  I  had  some  views  of  Mt
Rainer but it was shy today and stayed mostly hidden  under  a  large  cloud
cap. I climbed to a high point of about 4700 ft then dropped to a saddle  at
4300 ft after passing the junction with the alternate route. The final  road
to the lookout steepened for the last  500  ft  climb  to  the  summit  (3.5
miles, 1000 ft, 2:20 hrs). It was very windy on top with no real shelter  so
I didn\'t stay long.

I had a wonderful ski back in my track to camp arriving at 12:40  (7  miles,
1500 ft, 4:20 hrs RT). After a quick lunch I packed up  and  left  at  1:30.
For the return I followed the  untracked  road  past  the  small  lakes  and
uphill on now wet and sticky snow to intersect the groomed road.  As  I  was
climbing the last few feet  I  encountered  a  skier  watching  me  who  was
totally puzzled as to where I had come from (I  was  making  new  tracks  so
obviously hadn\'t gone down that way). It took me a while to  explain  and  I
am not sure she ever totally understood. I met more skiers  and  snowshoers,
most of whom had stayed at the hut. As I got lower extensive melting  became
more apparent and I had to walk the last now  bare  mile  to  the  car  (6.5
miles, 400 ft, 2:30 hrs from camp).

I did run into one couple out for the day who told me they  had  planned  to
ski at Paradise but were turned away at the Nisqually entrance and told  the
entire park was closed - with no other explanation. When I turned on my  car
radio while driving home I learned the tragic reason  for  this  closure  -a
park ranger had been shot and killed and the killer was still on the  loose.
And to think I almost chose Paradise as my overnight for the New Year.  Good
thing I didn\'t.

Trip Total: 22 miles and 4250 ft in 2 days

Mt Margaret via Rocky Run

Monday, January 23 -I skied  up  Rd  4832  from  the  motorized  Gold  Creek
SnoPark on a dusting of fresh powder over recent  snowmobile  tracks.  There
was only one machine in the lot when I arrived and he quickly zipped out  of
sight and sound. At the junction 2.5 miles up I went left onto  Rd  136.  No
recent snowmobiles had been this way so the fresh snow was  deeper  but  not
deep enough to make trail  breaking  hard.   At  3.75  miles  I  passed  the
junction to the left for the road that crosses Rocky  Run  and  climbs  onto
the ridge of Dungeon Pk. After 5.5 miles, at the third  switchback,  I  left
the road to climb through open woods toward the summit  of  Mt  Margaret.  I
was aiming for the true summit but the easier terrain  kept  pushing  me  to
the right and I ended up on the false summit. It got fairly steep  near  the
top. I had not gotten a particularly early start and it was getting late  so
I called it good for the day.  The ski down was delightful on perfect  snow.
I cut the switchbacks to my tracks on lower Rd 136. After a  short  slightly
uphill section I hit the main Rd 4832 which  to  my  pleasant  surprise  had
been freshly groomed. This made for a very fast run down to I-90.  The  only
slightly unpleasant portion of  the  entire  day  was  skiing  back  to  the
SnoPark next to I-90. I have never liked this mile section.

Total: 12 miles, 3175 ft and 7:45 hrs.

Friday, January 27 - I had so much fun  on  Monday  I  returned  on  Friday.
However, this time I had much more company in the SnoPark  to  the  tune  of
more than a dozen snowmobiles revving  their  engines.  "Sharing"  the  road
with them was not appealing. I had been thinking about a way to  avoid  both
the machines and the stretch along I-90. An old spur  leaves  Rd  4832  very
near the SnoPark. It is ditched  and  blocked  at  the  start  and  slightly
overgrown but very skiable. It  dead  ends  on  the  hillside  above  but  I
thought a way could be forced to a connection with Rd 136.  To  this  end  I
skied the spur and a right junction to its end at 3200 ft and then tried  an
upward traverse to hit the road that goes to the Dungeon  Pk  Ridge.  But  I
was too low and got into steep and nasty terrain for  skis.  It  would  have
been better to climb immediately to hit the road  higher  up  despite  added
elevation gain.

Once on the road I skied down it to cross Rocky Run and join Rd 136  on  the
other side. This is a shorter more direct route to this  junction  than  the
way I went Monday, 2 miles as opposed to 3.75, but  it  is  not  any  faster.
They both took about  2  hours.  Once  on  Rd  136  I  skied  to  the  first
switchback where I left the road to traverse left past cliffs until I  could
climb steeply up to the Twin Lakes Basin. Lovely terrain led past the  lakes
to the NW ridge and true summit of Mt Margaret.

I wanted to descend the same way I had on Monday as it was shorter  and  the
skiing was better than the way I had come up today. It sure  helped  that  I
knew the way. Without prior knowledge it would be easy to get  into  trouble
as there are many cliffs on the west side of Mt Margaret. The ski  down  was
every bit as good as Monday - until I hit the road. This was a  sunnier  day
and in areas hit by full sun a strong breakable sun  crust  had  formed.  It
was particularly bad on the descent from the Dungeon  Ridge  Road  (which  I
took from a higher point) to the spur road and almost unskiable.   But  once
on the spur road itself the snow was  protected  and  powdery  again  and  a
lovely ski down.

Total:       8       miles,       3600       ft       and       9       hrs.

Dungeon Pk Circumnavigation - February 2, 2012

Tuesday, January 31 - My interest  of  late  is  finding  new  (to  me)  and
interesting ski routes up or around peaks previously climbed. On  Tuesday  I
skied up the spur road from  the  motorized  Gold  Creek  SnoPark  with  the
express purpose of clipping it out to make it more skiable.  I  spent  about
two hours doing this, all the way to the end of longer left branch below  an
open slope. From there I checked out  a  new  reasonably  good  way  to  the
Dungeon Ridge road about 300 ft above. This was meant to be a short  day  as
a reconnaissance for a longer trip later but I had time to continue  up  the
ridge a ways before returning the same way. I discovered that Dungeon  Ridge
makes a splendid ski tour in its own right.

Thursday, February 2 - Two days later I returned with a much earlier  start.
My goal was to climb up Dungeon Pk from the south ridge, ski down the  north
side to Lake Lillian and return via  a  traverse  past  Twin  Lakes  and  Mt
Margaret. I had always wanted to ski the inviting looking  area  above  Lake
Lillian and I thought this would make a grand  loop.  Conditions  were  good
with about 4 inches new powder,  moderate  avalanche  danger  and  predicted
sunshine.

I quickly made short work of the now clipped spur road  and  onto  Dungeon\'s
south ridge, following the road along the upper ridge to its end in a clear-
cut at 4600 ft. When I first climbed Dungeon Pk on 3/28/95 I  had  continued
up the ridge until stopped by cliffs. I then left  skis  and  descended  200
feet off the ridge to the west and traversed  below  cliffs  until  I  could
kick steps up a steep snow gully to the NW ridge and on  to  the  summit.  I
returned the same way. This time I traversed through trees below  the  ridge
directly from the clear-cut. It was steep in places but doable and  I  ended
up right where I wanted to be at the base of the gully.  The  gully  however
was quite steep and about at my limit for climbing on skis. It  was  also  a
bit nerve-wracking despite  avalanche  danger  being  moderate,  as  it  was
exposed to the direct sun and funneled into a nasty black abyss  below.  Not
a place I wanted to be caught in a slide,  however  small.  Fortunately  the
day started cloudy and  the  snow  had  not  yet  warmed  up  significantly.
Nevertheless I breathed a sigh of relief when I reached the  5500  ft  notch
at the top and I most certainly did not want to return that way.

I had a  stunning  view  of  Rampart  Ridge  from  the  notch.  Easy  slopes
continued on the north side to the summit at 1:30 (5 miles,  3500  ft,  5:30
hrs). Despite warm sunshine it was too windy to have  lunch  here  so  after
snapping a few pictures I immediately skied down the inviting  north  slope.
This  much  anticipated  run  did  not  disappoint.  Fun,  fun,   fun   over
interesting and varied moderate terrain on excellent  snow  that  ended  way
too soon at lovely Lake Lillian.  Lovely as it was again I  could  not  stop
at the lake for lunch  due  to  wind  and  snow  swirling  across  the  open
expanse. I finally found a spot for lunch out of the wind  and  in  the  sun
just past the outlet creek at 2:30.

The traverse from 4800 ft Lake Lillian to 4700  ft  Twin  Lakes  went  quite
well except for having to drop  slightly  below  a  cliff  band  coming  off
Running Rock Pk, after which I had to climb back up again.  I  reached  Twin
Lakes at 3:50. These protected  north  facing  slopes  preserved  the  fresh
powder snow and skiing was excellent in the basin. I  was  now  on  familiar
territory from my trip up Mt Margaret of last  week.  I  continued  climbing
over Margaret\'s NW shoulder to get past cliffs. Up to now I had run into  no
signs of anyone else. However, on the descent from this point on I ran  into
fresh tracks of two other skiers coming off Mt Margaret. And when I  hit  Rd
136 it was tracked by a few snowmobiles. However, by now it was late  enough
(5:20) that everyone else had gone home and I never ran into any  makers  of
the tracks. I  cut  a  couple  of  switchbacks  but  the  snow  quality  was
deteriorating quickly and I soon stuck to the gentle road. No matter. I  was
getting tired and skiing was quite pleasant in  the  snowmobile  track.  The
moon was up high enough and bright enough that I was able to use  its  light
solely almost all the way to the junction with Rd 4832 at  6:20.  This  main
road was so well tracked as to be almost, but not quite, as  good  as  being
groomed. Even the un-looked-forward-to section along I-90 was not  half  bad
with a stiff easterly wind at my back propelling  me  all  the  way  to  the
SnoPark. I ended my grand loop at 7:20 to an empty lot.

Total: 13 miles, 4400 ft and 11:20 hrs

February 9, 2012

Powerline Peak - 1980 ft - P420 -Uncas Quad - From Blyn I drove  Snow  Creek
Road/Rd 2850 turning  left onto Spur 120. This road is narrow but good  most
of way before getting quite muddy after about 2 miles. At 2.6 miles  I  took
a rough track left .2 miles before being stopped by deep muddy tracks.  From
here I hiked the track to its end then through forest to the power line  and
the benchmark on a large boulder next to a tower. There  is  a  track  under
the power line so presumably one could drive directly to this spot  - but  I
don\'t know how drivable it is.  (.6 miles, 200 ft, :39 hrs)

Pk 2018 - P680 - Gardiner Quad - After Powerline I returned  to  Snow  Creek
Road and took Rd 2906  (and obvious junctions - see map) about 4.5 miles  to
below this peak where I drove a very rough track left a short way.  This  is
a true 4X4 track probably best walked but I was in 4X4 mode and  having  fun
in the mud in my Jeep. The track was blocked at a good road coming from  the
north which I hiked up. The actual summit is slightly off the road  in  open
forest. (.6 mile, 180 ft, :37 hrs)

On the way out, since I was in the area and still  in  4X4  mode  I  took  a
rough muddy crossover road to the good road up to Blyn LO. Nothing  to  see.
It was too foggy.



February 12, 2012

Blyn Mtn - 2120+ ft - P1240 - Gardiner Quad - The key  to  Blyn  is  finding
the correct start to the road to  the  top.  On  the  way  to  Powerline  on
February 9 I checked out every possibility from the east  and  north.  Roads
shown on the map to go through either were  non-existent,  abandoned,  ended
in private property or were gated.  I even thought a  spur  off  2906  might
connect. No such luck. The proper road is  Casselary  Road  off  West  Uncas
Road where a short mile up there is  a  gate  and  a  small  "towers"  sign.
Parking is tight. I biked up this road. After 2.5  miles,  at  a  switchback
right, it gets quite steep and I pushed the bike the  last  mile.  There  is
another gate to go through before reaching the towers on top. I  counted  12
towers but it was so foggy I may have missed a few. A  fun  fast  run  down.
(6.8 miles, 1650 ft, 2:20 hrs)

Lordodendron Hill - 2204 ft - P644 - Uncas Quad - I  drove  toward  Quilcene
and onto Snow Creek Rd, Lords Lake Loop and Little Quilcene Rd to park in  a
wide spot SW of the peak just past the  clear-cut.  I  hiked  up  reasonable
forest and mild brush to the W saddle. Cliffs forced a route  to  the  north
until I could swing back to gain the summit ridge. The top  was  a  not-too-
thick rhododendron forest. (1.5 miles, 1050 ft, 2 hrs)

I had time to check out the 2 roads up Skid Row but  no  time  to  climb  it
before heading home.





February 15, 2012

Big Skidder Hill - 2126 ft - P1166 - Uncas Quad - I took Wycoff Rd off  West
Uncas Rd to the gate.  Again  tight  parking.  This  road  goes  through  to
connect with Snow Creek Road on the west but I  determined  it  was  shorter
from this east end. I biked the road easily for 2 miles to B6000 left.  This
is a good but very steep road that I pushed the bike up almost  2  miles  to
where it finally flattened. It was an exhausting effort but the  thought  of
the ride down kept me going. At the saddle the main road went  straight.  My
map indicated a spur right, slightly downhill, went all the way to the  top.
However this spur soon ended at huge ditches at the edge of  the  clear-cut.
I left my bike here. Oddly, once through the several ditches  the  road  was
quite good and would be bikeable if you could get the bike past the  ditches
and downed trees. Near the top a junction came in from the left,  not  shown
on my map. It is possible this road connects to the main road but I  am  not
sure. Anyway my way worked and I hiked the road all  the  way  to  the  top.
Once back to the bike it was a fast and furious ride down,  well  worth  the
effort of pushing the bike up. (9.5 miles, 2100 ft, 4:10 hrs)

Skid Row - 2563 ft - P483 - Uncas Quad - On to Snow  Creek  Road  again  and
the first Skid Row Rd. I parked at the  end  and  climbed  up  rather  nasty
brush/slash to the road above. This can be avoided  by  driving  the  second
road and hiking or biking the gated spur 1.7 miles to the same  point.  Take
your pick. I hiked the upper road a short distance to an old overgrown  spur
right.  Recent activity, survey markers  and  boundary  cut  signs  indicate
changes might happen in the future. I followed the  spur  to  a  brushy  end
above Rixon Cr, crossed the creek and entered pleasant open  forest  on  the
NW ridge to the summit. I left a small register on this one in  a  stump  on
top as there seemed to be a definite high point  and  the  whole  thing  was
surprisingly more enjoyable than expected. (2.6 miles, 825 ft, 2:40 hrs)



February 17. 2012

Skid Mark - 1341 ft - P760 - Uncas Quad  -  This  peak  gave  me  a  lot  of
trouble finding a way up that didn\'t cross private property.  I  tried  from
the south up Elkhorn Ln (which presumably goes all the way to the  house  on
top) but that ended at a high security gate not easily circumvented with  no
parking and no turnaround. I tried the road on the SW but that has a  cable,
private property sign and official looking no parking sign. I looked at  the
road on the north opposite the road up Scalped Hill  (I  think  Stefan  went
this way)  but  it  is  signed  no  trespassing.  I  try  not  to  cross  no
trespassing signs unless there is no other way to go. I finally  settled  on
starting from the gated road on the east. No signs, public  property  and  a
good place to park. I expected this route to be rather nasty and it was  but
at least I didn\'t cross any private property - except at the very top.

I hiked the road and a spur right that ended in  a  clear-cut.  Rough  paths
allowed a way through the clear-cut to the edge of a wide  marsh  at  Ripley
Creek. I crossed on tuffs of earth and logs. On the other  side  things  got
unpleasant with stitchery brush. It did improve somewhat as I got higher.  I
ended up almost directly below the house on top at a short slabby cliff.  No
one appeared to be around but it was so foggy I doubt they would  have  seen
me in any event. The high point was slightly off the driveway in the  woods.
This peak completed the Uncas Quad for me. (2 miles, 780 ft, 2:50 hrs)

Pk 2720+ - P400 - Mt Zion Quad - This was an easy one. I  drove  Snow  Creek
Road past both roads up Skid Row to the first junction  left,  Rd  2852.  At
the junction with Rd 2845 I went a short ways left to a  ditched  spur.  The
ditch was minor and others had gone through it  so  I  did  also.  Past  the
ditch the road was quite good. The road continues in  a  loop  drivable  all
the way around the peak although to the right is the better road.  I  parked
at an old grassy ditched spur on the south side.  This  track  and  pleasant
open forest led easily to the top. (.4 mile, 270 ft, :26 hr)

Pk 2600+ - P400 - Mt Zion Quad - This should have been trivial.  It  wasn\'t.
I continued on Rd 2845 and Rd 2840 to where 2 spurs took off right.  I  took
the right hand one (071) and drove to below the peak. I was  less  than   .1
mile away but the area had been recently thinned  of  scrub  trees  and  the
downed branches and trunks littered the entire summit hill  with  an  almost
impassible mess of bottomless debris. There was no  solid  ground  anywhere.
It took me over 30 minutes to struggle  to  the  top  and  back.  Positively
awful leg breaking stuff. If it had been any farther I would have passed  on
this true bottom-of-the barrel dumpster. (.2 mile, 130 ft, :32 hrs)

Just to make sure I visited the other two 2600 ft  closed  contours  on  the
ridge. Not nearly as bad, just some  ordinary  brush,  but  unfortunately  I
really think the pick-up-stick thinnings pile is the high point.

Lookout Hill - 1960+ ft - P400 - Mt Zion Quad - I returned to Rd 2840  until
it ran into Palo Alto Rd. I had been this way many times and knew  the  road
up Lookout was gated. I parked at the gate and biked 1.8 miles to  the  spur
going to the top. Unfortunately this spur  is  almost  non-existent,  barely
followeable and covered with large downed trees at the  start.  I  left  the
bike and struggled to the top. Why this hill is called  Lookout  I  have  no
clue. It is heavily wooded with no view. The fact that is was foggy and  now
raining didn\'t help. I had planned on being able to bike all the way to  top
and when I couldn\'t the whole thing took more time  than  expected.  It  was
getting late and darkness was encroaching. Urgency was  added  by  the  fact
that I had neglected to put my  headlamp  in  my  bike  pack.  Not  good.  I
whizzed back on my bike down the road to the car with just enough  light  to
avoid obstacles. That was cutting it a little too  close.  (4.6  miles,  485
ft, 1:28 hr)

(P480) - Hoodsport Quad - February 23, 2012

I started from the DNR gate off the Lake Cushman Road. Note that  this  gate
is open from April 15 to October 1 and so these roads can be  driven  during
those dates. I am usually off doing more exciting things in that time  frame
so elected to bike during the closure. I am always looking  for  new  things
to do during the winter to stay in shape and  this  makes  for  a  wonderful
bike trip with a good workout. The roads are all  in  good  shape  and  very
bikeable although the spurs up both Saddle and Pk 1680+ (they are not  shown
on maps but are on satellite) are quite steep. The  others  are  all  fairly
gentle.

I first biked up Saddle going left at the first major junction  at  .7  mile
and pushing up the final steep spur. The road goes all the way  to  the  top
which is quite flat and I wandered a bit looking for the high point.  I  had
a pleasant lunch on top in the sun (4.7 miles, 1125 ft, 1:30 hrs).

I returned to the first junction and went the other way. This road  is  flat
to slightly downhill until crossing the creek flowing into Price Lake. At  a
major junction right it then begins to climb, but not  too  steeply.  I  was
initially dismayed to find the road freshly graveled.  Gravel  is  not  good
for biking. But it was fairly  compacted  and  not  a  real  problem.  At  a
junction at 1200 ft and marked "Dow Mtn Loop" and "1700" I went  left  on  a
lesser road to the steep spur that led to the  top  of  Pk  1680+.  Again  I
pushed. This spur is beginning to slough down the steep hillside  and  might
be a problem in a vehicle. The summit was just off the road in  a  stand  of
"leave trees" (12.4 miles, 2170 ft, 4 hrs).

I returned to the 1200 ft junction and began a long gentle  traverse  toward
Dow Mtn. My map showed this road going all the way to the top  but  alas  it
did not. After passing a junction left  pointing  to  a  woodcutting  permit
area my road began to look less used. Sure enough about .6 mile farther  the
road ended. It was completely decommissioned and unusable  by  bike.  But  I
determined I was not that far from the summit as  the  crow  flies  and  the
forest did not look that bad. So I left  my  bike  here  at  1700  ft  (17.5
miles, 2900 ft, 5:30 hrs) and hiked to the  top.  Although  the  forest  was
completely snowfree I was surprised to find about a  foot  of  snow  in  the
opening on top (18.2 miles, 3800 ft, 6:30) I also was surprised to  find  no
tower. For some reason I thought there would be one as a good road comes  in
from the south.

I returned to my bike, the roundtrip having taken 1:40 hrs with 1000  ft  of
gain with ups and downs (18.7 miles, 3900 ft, 7:10  hrs).  Although  it  was
getting late I took time to have a snack and bundle up for  the  anticipated
cold ride down. It was now 5:45 and the sun was setting.  No  problem.  This
time I did not forget my light. I got down most of the  way  to  the  valley
bottom before needing it and I reached the car at 7:00.

Total: 25.5 miles, 4100 ft and 8:30 hrs

I have long been intrigued by the description of this little rocky  peak  in
the Olympic Mountains: A Climbing Guide. I saved it for  a  warm  sunny  day
when high avalanche danger kept me off higher summits. I  expected  snow  on
the approach roads so brought skis. Even so I was surprised  that  the  snow
level was so low. I ran into some almost immediately  off  Hwy  101  on  the
Hamma Hamma Road. Good grief! This road  is  only  600  ft  elevation.  Then
again I did hear the Hood Canal area got a big  dump  (like  8  -10  inches)
with the  last  lowland  event  so  I  guess  I  shouldn\'t  have  been  that
surprised. I was worried I wouldn\'t be able to get close  enough  to  do  my
trip in a day and I nearly wasn\'t. Turning off onto Road 2510 I  encountered
a deep patch a mere mile up.  My  Jeep  barely  made  it  through.  Then  it
actually got better once out of the shady valley and I even  had  some  bare
patches of ground where the sun  had  hit.  Luckily  I  was  able  to  drive
another 4 miles before being stopped for good at  elevation  1680  ft.  This
was still a mile shy of the junction with Road 2503 where  I  had  hoped  to
get but it was good enough.

I began by skiing up the road. In 30 minutes I was to the junction of  2503.
The climber\'s guide describes this road as a bit  overgrown.  Well  it  must
have been brushed out since the guide was written as it is now a  very  good
wide road. Perhaps new logging has  occurred  somewhere  along  its  length.
Anyway I easily followed it 3.2 miles to a spur right at elevation  2850  ft
(1270 ft, 2:15 hrs). This spur began very brushy and was  a  real  trial  on
skis. I almost gave up. Fortunately I didn\'t and it improved  greatly  after
rounding a rib. It actually became very nice  skiing,  gaining  very  little
elevation. After about 1.5 miles (1625 ft, 3:35 hrs) I left skis and  kicked
steps up a broad drainage and hillside through mostly open forest (with  the
occasional annoying rhododendron grove) to the SE Ridge. Once on  the  ridge
it was a matter of picking my way along the cornices.

Where the ridge steepened below the false summit I worked left up  and  over
it to the base of the summit block. The climbers guide describes this  as  a
short exposed class 4 pitch. My experience with  this  guide  is  that  they
often underestimate difficulty so I came prepared with rope and pro.  I  was
pleasantly surprised when it didn\'t appear to  be  as  bad  as  I  expected.
However, since it was exposed and I had it, I  roped  up  and  self  belayed
myself. Perhaps the snow made it  easier  as  I  could  kick  steps  up  the
vertical section but I really didn\'t need all that gear.

I popped over the small cornice above  the  pitch  onto  the  gentle  summit
ridge and followed it to the top (6.5 miles, 2760 ft,  5:30  hrs).  I  found
the benchmark labeled "Watson" which explains the alternate  name  for  this
peak and placed a register in the empty cairn. There was  a  great  view  of
The Brothers. A wind was kicking up so I  downclimbed  to  my  pack  at  the
bottom of the pitch for "lunch". I would have rappelled  but  could  see  no
obvious anchors.

I quickly retraced my steps to my skis. It was pleasant  skiing  the  gentle
spur road (except for the short brushy section) and very  nice  indeed  down
Road 2503. By the time I made it back to the junction  with  Road  2510  (12
miles, 2900 ft, 8:30 hrs) it was dark and  I  needed  my  headlamp.  Despite
that I decided to continue to Webb Mtn since I was so close. I  had  planned
on car camping and was in no great hurry.

There is not much to say about Webb. The entire trip was in  forest  and  in
the dark; however I was treated to the occasional glimpse of the  full  moon
reflecting off Hood Canal that added loveliness. A road goes all the way  to
the wooded summit although the final spur was so overgrown I gave up  on  it
and kicked steps straight uphill. Oddly, I  found  a  plastic  garden  chair
half buried in the snow of the small opening on top (13.8  miles,  3750  ft,
10 hrs).  But as near as I could tell there was no view so I am not sure  of
its intended purpose. I myself preferred to sit on my insulating pack  while
having a snack and finishing off the last of my hot chocolate.

I ended this long trip with an enjoyable  glide  down  the  road  under  the
light of a now high full moon. Oh I do love skiing in the moonlight.

Side trip to Webb: 3.6 miles, 850 ft and 2:30 hrs

Watch Mtn (4805 ft - P645 - Randle Quad) - Wednesday, March 21, 2012

Once again the avalanche danger was high.  This  seems  to  be  a  recurring
theme this ski season limiting choice of destinations.  I  thought  I  could
safely do this trip as it is all on logging roads or through forest.  I  was
able to drive Rd 75 out of Randle 4 miles to elevation 2080 ft before  being
stopped by deep new snow. I really pushed it the  last  mile  with  my  Jeep
dragging bottom and the bumper acting as a snow plow spewing powder up  over
the hood and onto the windshield. I really should have  stopped  sooner  and
paid for this error in judgment with 30 minutes  of  shoveling  so  I  could
turn around and park.

I skied the flat road 1.1 miles and then went up through the  woods  to  cut
off more flat road and a very long switchback. I figured I  saved  about  an
hour and at least 1.5 miles by doing so and it wasn\'t  too  bad  although  I
did have  to  take  off  my  skis  for  one  short  steep  section.  Once  I
intersected Rd 7561 above, I followed it through a  clear  cut  (1)  and  up
several switchbacks on the east end of the long main Watch Mtn ridge  before
turning a corner to the north side. The snow was very nice though there  was
a lot of new and trail breaking was slow. From the corner a  short  traverse
and downhill led to another clear cut (2). Up to now it had been cloudy  but
not snowing and there were some distant views. That  began  to  change  with
light snowfall and reduced visibility.

I stuck with the road as it climbed through  the  clear  cut  and  around  a
knoll as I wasn\'t quite sure how I was going to  gain  the  main  Watch  Mtn
ridge. I had thought I could  go  farther  toward  Watch  Lake  but  I  soon
determined that the whole north side of the ridge from  here  on  was  steep
and cliffy. My best bet was to follow a rib up the clear cut  to  the  broad
saddle above and cross to the south side. This I easily did. The  clear  cut
ended at the saddle where I entered woods. I knew from the map that I  would
most likely hit a steep section crossing a south running rib before I  could
gain more gentle terrain on the south slope proper.  What  I  didn\'t  expect
was this rib to turn out to be a cliff band that forced a descent of 300  ft
before I could get past it. But once past this, delightful  open  woods  led
to another clear cut (3) at the saddle just east of the main summit.

I picked up the road in clear cut 3 and followed it past cliffs on the  east
slope to where I could access easy terrain on the south  slope.  The  actual
summit ridge itself was wooded. Three closed 4800 ft contours  show  on  the
map and I visited all three. The surveyed 4805 point is the west one  but  I
am sure the east point is higher (5.5 miles, 3500 ft, 7:50 hrs).

I had a delightful run off the summit, even managing a few  telemark  turns,
and an even more delightful run through the open woods -  until  I  hit  the
cliff band. Then it all went to h###. I didn\'t want to follow my  in  tracks
as they were very steep and right at the base of the cliff wall. So I  tried
a lower tack on what I thought  would  be  easier  terrain.  It  wasn\'t.  If
anything it was worse. There were many obstacles:  steep  deep  snow  banks,
gullies, downed trees, creeks. I couldn\'t just go straight  up  and  had  to
wander back and forth finding a way often wallowing in bottomless snow.  And
of course it was now dark and snowing steadily. But how hard  could  it  be,
really? All I had to do was go uphill until I crossed  my  tracks  near  the
saddle. Well I did cross some tracks eventually but these  were  not  my  in
tracks, they were my out tracks. I had gone in a complete circle!  Not  only
did I do this once but I did this TWICE.  I still  can\'t  understand  how  I
managed to do this. Let me tell you one you get confused  wandering  in  the
woods  in  the  dark  it  is  hard  to  get  unconfused.  It  is  also  very
embarrassing. I hesitate to even admit I had done it.  I  offer  this  as  a
lesson in humility. At one point I thought about digging  a  snow  cave  and
waiting until morning. But I had an important engagement to  make  the  next
day. If I missed that I would be even more embarrassed especially when  they
found out why. That kept me moving.

I ended up finally making it to the saddle with  the  constant  help  of  my
GPS. I had referred to it before intermittently but that  wasn\'t  enough  to
keep me on track. And remember a GPS can tell you where you need to  go  but
not what line can be taken to get there. It does not allow for obstacles  in
the way. My guess is that all my wanderings, which  lasted  about  an  hour,
were in a very small area, probably less  than  a  baseball  field.  Anyway,
once back at the saddle all went well from then on and I  just  followed  my
tracks out. I really rather enjoy skiing  roads  by  headlamp.  But  I  must
admit reaching the car at 11:00 was a bit much.

To make matters worse, I had lowland snow falling and sticking to the  roads
all the way home until Puyallup. That added to the drive time.  Not  what  I
needed after a long and tiring trip.

Total: 11 miles, 4200 ft and 13 hrs

Bergen Mtn (3760+ ft - P80 - Morton Quad) - April 4, 2012

Although of low elevation and little prominence this is the highest peak  on
the Morton Quad and it made for a nice ski tour.

The hardest part of this trip was driving the maze  of  logging  roads  from
the south close enough to do it. From Hwy 508 out of Morton I  turned  right
onto Road 73 then Road 7302. The latter road has numerous  very  deep  water
bars, almost impassible in places. My high  clearance  Jeep  scraped  bottom
and struggled on several of them but did make  it  through.  After  about  2
miles of this I came to an even worse washed out  section  where  I  had  to
straddle a deep creek ditch for a couple hundred feet. Past  that  the  road
improved again until I was stopped by  snow  just  before  a  switchback  at
about 2000 ft elevation. The total distance on Rd 7302 was 2.4 miles.

I only had to walk about Â¼ mile to  consistent  snow  where  I  could  start
skiing.  After about a mile I took a junction  right  and  in  another  half
mile a junction left onto an overgrown but skiable spur. This  spur  climbed
up onto the ridge, crossed to other side and traversed at the top of an  old
clear-cut. Rather than continue to the  end  of  the  spur  (which  did  not
connect to the good roads up Bergen coming from  the  north)  I  elected  to
take a more direct route up through pleasant open forest to the ridge  above
and west peak road. Once there it was delightful skiing  up  good  roads  to
Bergen Mtn (3.5 miles, 2000 ft, 3 hrs). I had nice views north to Mt  Elbert
and The Rockies.

So far the weather was holding with light snow showers and  sun  breaks.  It
was still early and the terrain looked inviting to continue exploring  so  I
skied to the little summit to the north that is actually a tad  higher  than
Bergen but is unnamed (Pt 3800). A  little  rocky  pinnacle  along  the  way
added interest. Then I skied back to the west peak  by  following  the  road
around the summit almost in a circle to its end and up a short  steep  slope
to the top. By now the weather had deteriorated to a heavy snow  squall  and
low visibility. I had no more views.

To return, I skied down the edge of the clear-cut  on  semi-open  slopes  to
pick up the spur road below and intersect my in tracks. Once  off  the  spur
road and on the main road it was a quick run down. This  little  peak  ended
up being a lot more fun than anticipated.

Salvation Pk (5560+ ft - P640 - Damnation Pk Quad) - April 7, 2012

Originally I wasn\'t going to write a TR for this as  Matt  and  company  had
just done it two weeks previous and I couldn\'t really add much to  his  fine
report               and                excellent                photographs
(http://www.nwhikers.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=7997245).  Also   I   didn\'t
take that many photos. I was too tired. But it was such a  fun  trip  and  I
was so excited to finally be able to do a  big  elevation  peak  (the  first
since my injury of late last summer) that I couldn\'t  resist.  Matt  prefers
the name "Hellfire" while I have always had it  on  my  list  as  Salvation.
That name now seems even more appropriate to me personally  since  it  marks
the start of my return to the real thing after 6 months  of  slow  recovery.
So it shall always be Salvation Pk to me.
This trip was organized by Lisa. Others  joining  along  were  Jim,  Eileen,
Carry, Bill and Paul. It was a very enjoyable group. We were able  to  drive
the Bacon Creek Road all the way to the spur just  before  the  crossing  of
Bacon Creek, elev 800 ft. We hiked  this  spur  a  short  half  mile  before
taking off up fairly open mossy woods essentially  following  Matt\'s  route.
The trees were dripping melting new snow. At 3000 ft we  put  on  snowshoes.
There was at least a foot of new snow in open areas as we worked our way  up
to the saddle with Oakes at 4800 ft. By the time we had  done  the  4000  ft
gain to the saddle everyone, except  me,  was  all  for  calling  this  peak
Hellfire. The ascent is steep and relentless with no views. But once at  the
saddle it was all worthwhile with glorious views in  every  direction  along
the beautiful open up and down ridge to the summit (5300 ft, 6:15 hrs)

There was a cold wind on the summit that prevented  hanging  out  there  for
long. We did fine a sheltered spot out of the wind and in the  sun  a  short
ways below for a pleasant lunch break. Although small,  the  ups  along  the
ridge on the way back were a real effort for me as  I  was  running  out  of
steam. Then it was all downhill from the saddle. When the  slope  got  steep
we elected to  remove  snowshoes  and  boot  down  despite  some  impressive
postholing. The snow was very soft and wet. Due to  a  somewhat  late  start
the last hour was done by headlamp but our  overall  time  was  exactly  the
same as Matt\'s.

My thanks to Matt for the beta, to Lisa  for  organizing  the  trip  and  to
everyone else for their excellent company.

Total: 7 miles, 5600 ft and 11 hrs.

Davis Mtn (4804 ft - P524) and Pk 4845 (P525) - Purcell  Mtn  Quad  -  April
12, 2012

 I took Davis Cr Rd, off Hwy 12 a few miles before Packwood, to FR 63  which
I was able to drive to 2600 ft before being stopped by  snow.  This  is  the
normal access to Purcell Mtn, a P2000 peak, but my goal today was Davis  Mtn
and Pk 4845 on the other side of Davis Cr. Logging spurs climb high on  both
these peaks and I thought they would provide good ski routes. They did.

It was beautiful sunshine on the entire 2.5 hour drive up but  I  could  see
dark clouds forming to the south. Sure enough as soon as I left  the  car  a
drenching rain squall hit. It didn\'t last too long  but  it  was  enough  to
soak me and was not an encouraging start to the day. I resigned myself to  a
wet foggy day with no views.  Fortunately,  after  a  couple  more  squalls,
which turned to snow as I  got  higher,  the  weather  improved  greatly  to
cloudy with sun breaks.

I skied the road 3 Â¼ miles to just past the second switchback where  a  spur
went right to clear-cuts on the west slope of  Davis.  I  took  the  highest
spur to its end and climbed up the new clear-cut there to the  south  ridge.
Some interest was added as I had to traverse below a little rocky  area  and
then some cornices while following the ridge to the summit (4.75 miles,  2250
ft, 3:40 hrs). I had reasonable views up to Purcell  Mtn  and  down  to  the
Cowlitz Valley as I ate lunch just below the summit. The sun came and  went.


After lunch I continued along the ridge to drop  steeply  down  forest  (not
great skiing) to an older clear- cut that I could  traverse  to  the  saddle
with Pk 4845. At the saddle the clear-cut ended and I put on skins to  climb
pleasant open forest to the summit of Pk 4845 (6 miles, 2850 ft, 5:45  hrs).
Here I entered another clear-cut that I skied down to pick up Road 63  about
a mile from where I had left it for Davis. This section was  very  flat  and
the snow now soft and slushy so this road run was  not  very  swift  and  it
took 30 minutes to ski. Once I hit my up tracks things speeded up a bit  and
I was back to the car in another hour.

I had heavy rain showers on the drive  home,  more  than  I  had  during  my
entire day of skiing. Despite the start I guess I was pretty  lucky  overall
with what I encountered.

Total: 11 miles, 2850 ft and 8 hrs

Kiona Pk (4849 ft - P1529 - Kiona Pk Quad) - Friday, April 27, 2012

There are certainly easier and shorter ways up Kiona  Pk.   But  ever  since
skiing up Watch Mtn a month ago I really wanted to approach from  the  north
side of that peak.  The  terrain  looked  interesting,  variable  and  quite
skiable linking a series of roads.  I also wanted to visit  Watch  Lake  and
Watch Mtn Lookout. It turned out to not  disappoint  although  it  was  very
long with lots of ups and downs.

I again drove Road 75 out of Randle and this time  was  able  to  drive  5.5
miles to the current end of drivable road  at  a  washout,  elevation  2100.
From there I went straight uphill through an  unpleasant  clear-cut  to  hit
the road above. I only had to walk another half mile or so  before  I  could
start skiing at about 2900 ft. It had snowed a couple  of  inches  overnight
above 3500 ft. I repeated my route of Watch Mtn by  following  the  road  to
the first clear-cut on the north side then diverged  by  dropping  600  feet
through forest and a second clear-cut to Watch Lake. I could see  the  ridge
road I was aiming  for  in  the  distance  on  the  other  side  but  cliffs
prevented reaching it without dropping all the way to the lake.

At the lake I was stymied by 5 ft vertical snow walls on either side of  the
outlet creek. I had no ice axe and I didn\'t  think  I  could  cross  without
difficulty and the risk of falling into the water. Luckily  I  was  able  to
ski all the way around the lake and pick up the road on the other side.   An
upper spur of this road dead-ended 400 feet below the ridge  road  but  semi
open slopes  provided  an  easy  connection.  The  ridge  had  been  heavily
corniced many of which had collapsed with warm weather onto the road  in  an
impressive display of snow blocks. I sure wouldn\'t want to  be  around  when
that debris came crashing down. The lookout was  perched  above  me  on  the
ridge but it would have to wait for my return. For now it was on  to  Kiona,
still a ways away.

I climbed to a minor 4600 ft saddle on the ridge, crossed to the south  side
and dropped 500 ft to the saddle north of Kiona  where  I  followed  a  spur
road that dead-ended on the east ridge at 4400 ft.  I  left  skis  and  pack
here for a mad dash to the summit. Although the day  had  started  promising
with sun breaks and partial clearing it had  now  deteriorated  and  it  was
beginning to snow steadily. I quickly kicked  steps  in  soft  snow  to  the
summit (7.5 miles, 3900 ft, 6:20 hrs). The last bit was steep and  a  little
tricky without an ice axe (really  dumb  but  I  wasn\'t  expecting  anything
technical). However, the snow was so soft I was able to  use  my  ski  poles
upside down and insert the handles deep enough for good support.

I had just enough time  to  visit  Watch  Mtn  Lookout  on  the  return  but
unfortunately had no views. It was still snowing and also windy so I  didn\'t
hang around for long. Winter is not yet done in  the  mountains.  It  snowed
all the way out. With all the ups and downs it was  nice  the  snow  was  so
soft and sticky I didn\'t have to use skins at all. The no  wax  base  worked
fine. That saved a lot of time not having to put them on and take them  off.
Darkness did catch me but by then I was on the main  road  and  at  least  I
didn\'t get lost and confused as I had on my Watch Mtn  adventure.  That  was
an improvement.

Total: 16 miles, 5300 ft and 11:30 hrs

Gibson Pk (4517 ft - P1437) and Colonel Bob (4510 ft - P1070) - Colonel  Bob
Quad - May 15-17, 2012

Colonel Bob is a tiny wilderness area  adjacent  to  Olympic  National  Park
east of Lake Quinault.  Its  main  claim  to  fame  is  Pete\'s  Creek  Trail
climbing from the West Fork Humptulips River.  There  is  also  a  connector
trail from the Lake Quinault side. The trail ends at the  old  lookout  site
(4492 ft) just west of the true summit (4510 ft). I had climbed  to  the  LO
in September of 1999 when I also  climbed  nearby  Mike\'s  Spike.  That  was
before I was aware of prominence so had missed the true summit. This time  I
also wanted to climb Gibson Pk which is the highest point (by  a  few  feet)
in the Wilderness. Since it is a long drive I planned to make a several  day
trip of it and take my time.

Tuesday, May 15 - I was unable to leave town until 3:30 and didn\'t start  up
the trail until 6:45. No matter. All I had to do was get to the  campsite  I
knew was at 2 miles (elev 2400 ft). The trail began in gorgeous rain  forest
carpeted by blooming oxalis, trillium and yellow violet. A color  feast  for
eyes tired of the monotones  of  winter\'s  snow  and  rock.  The  trail  had
several rough areas of washouts and/or avalanches that had been flagged  and
a few downed trees but was otherwise in good condition. At one mile was  the
crossing of Pete\'s Creek. It was running too high to rock hop but luckily  a
large log was just upstream. At 2 miles I  came  to  the  campsite  and  was
shocked to find a tent there. How could this be? There were  no  other  cars
at the TH. On closer inspection it became obvious the tent had been there  a
long time and was abandoned. It was littered  with  junk  including  trashed
food, an old sleeping bag and  a  large  (1.75  liter)  empty  bottle  of  R&R
Canadian Whiskey. Various scenarios played in  my  head  as  to  what  would
cause someone to leave valuable gear, all  of  them  involving  the  whiskey
bottle and a raucous party gone bad. I even  looked  for  bodies  but  found
none. I dismantled the tent and tossed it and the junk aside  to  make  room
for me. Despite the specter of ghosts it was a very pleasant campsite.

2 miles, 1350ft, 1:45 hrs

Wednesday, May 16 - I was underway at 7:20  next  morning.  Just  beyond  my
camp the trail opened up and became snow covered. I headed  straight  up  to
the obvious break in the cliffs west of Gibson working my way to the  ridge.
No real problems. Once on the ridge it was a short steep section  along  the
crest to the summit of Gibson (2150 ft, 3 hrs).  I  found  no  register  and
left none as it was completely snowed in.

So entranced was I by the beautiful basin to the NE that I did not  want  to
leave yet. This basin is surrounded by  several  other  high  points,  3  of
which are mentioned in the Olympic Climber\'s Guide. So in order  to  prolong
my stay I continued along the ridge to Pt  4454,  dropped  into  the  basin,
climbed to Pt 4418 (where the name Gibson is placed on  the  map)  and  then
returned through the basin below the ridge to Pt 4500.  All  were  easy  fun
peaks. Pk 4418 actually had a better summit with bare rock and Pk  4500  had
the best view of Colonel Bob.

I left Pk 4500 at 1:00 (3050 ft, 5:40) heading for  Colonel  Bob,  I  had  a
good view and picked out a route though the cliff  bands.  I  had  hoped  to
make a direct descent to Moonshine Flats. No such luck.  I  first  descended
the ridge in a different place than  my  up  route.  After  backing  down  a
hundred feet or so of steep snow I hit an icy section, gave up and made  one
50 ft rappel to get down the worst of it. From there I  could  see  no  easy
way straight down and ended up traversing back to my up route  and  dropping
all the way to 3100 ft where I more or less followed the trail to  Moonshine
Flats. From there I headed straight up to Colonel Bob. I got  off  route  in
the woods, hit the cliff band at a waterfall gully and got into  a  mess  of
steep brushy rock forcing my way up past it to the right.  At  one  point  I
had to take off my pack to get through. Open easy snow above the cliff  band
led to the base of the impressive summit rocks and ridge. From the looks  of
things I wasn\'t sure I could make it up. Then I saw a  snow  finger  to  the
right. And it sure looked like old tracks going that way luring me  on.  Had
someone else been here? Not likely. The snow finger ended in a brushy  rocky
slot that showed no signs  of  previous  passage.  It  was  worse  than  the
waterfall gully but I grunted and groaned  my  way  up  it  pulling  on  the
brush. I prayed it was easier once on the ridge. Mercifully it was. I  found
the bench mark on the rocky summit and left a register next to it (4600  ft,
10 hrs). I had a great view of Gibson and saw why I couldn\'t make  a  direct
descent to Moonshine Flats.

I was dismayed to see that there appeared to be an easy route  from  the  LO
and the NW side. But I couldn\'t be sure.  I  may  have  missed  seeing  some
cliffs looking down. I might have tried going down that way but had left  my
axe and pole at the base of the slot and so had had to return the same  way.
I rappelled the slot and bypassed the waterfall gully for  a  quick  descent
to camp.  It was now after 7:00, my feet were soaked and I was  tired  so  I
decided to spend another night.

Total: 4.5 miles, 4750 ft, 11:45 hrs

Thursday, May 17 - After a leisurely breakfast I packed up and left at  9:00
and reached the car  at 10:30.

Trip Total: 10.5 miles, and 6200 ft in 3 days

P.S. I did check out Quinault Ridge Road 2280 on the drive  out.  It  is  in
good condition to the ridge crest where it is gated. It would  make  a  nice
bike ride along the ridge to near the various high points.  I  did  hike  to
the first one (2654 ft, P454, Lake  Quinault  East  Quad),  then  had  lunch
before heading home (3/4 mile, 370 ft, 1 hr RT).

Big Methow Needle (8160+ ft - P1700 - Washington Pass Quad) - May 26, 2012

This peak was unfinished business for Matt, Mike and me. Last July we  three
made an attempt but were thwarted by  a  combination  of  factors  including
iffy weather, a late start, minimal gear and  totaling  underestimating  the
seriousness of the climb. We made it all the way to the col at the  base  of
the rock where an intimidating moat crossing was the final  straw  to  cause
us to pull the plug. We vowed to return earlier in  the  year  with  greater
determination and more preparedness.

As events unfolded we ended up with two more or  less  independent  parties,
Matt and Mike and Jim Eileen, Kevin and me. I drove over early on Friday  to
snag the last campsite in Klipchuck Campground at about 7:45  pm.  It  would
have been closer to camp at Lone Fir but it was still  snowed  in.  By  some
miracle the others found me in the dark crowded campground about  10:45  and
we all settled in for the night.

We didn\'t get a terribly early start starting  on  the  old  trail  up  Pine
Creek (8:00 am), but even so we had run into Matt and Mike at Lone  Fir  who
left maybe 30 minutes ahead of us. We followed their tracks to the  crossing
of Pine Creek where our routes diverged, they going up  the  right  side  of
the main gully and we up the left side.  The left side appeared to us to  be
more straightforward - all on snow and with no cliffs. As it turned  out  we
both arrived at the col to the right of the summit block at the  same  time,
1:00. The day had started sunny and warm but as it progressed  clouds  began
to  build.  There  was  enough  buildup  that  we  worried  it  could  begin
precipitating, which would be bad news if it caught us on the rock.  In  the
end it never amounted to anything other than causing  chilly  conditions  as
we waited our turn to climb.

We roped up, again as two separate rope teams. Everyone,  except  Mike,  was
in rock shoes which really helped. Matt led the first team. Conditions  were
much better than during our previous attempt. There was no moat and  it  was
easy to step off the snow onto the rock. That is not to say the first  moves
were easy. We all had trouble there as the holds were minimal. I found  this
section the hardest of the climb. In fact, I peeled off it when I pulled  on
a piece of pro that let loose. But Eileen caught me on belay and  I  had  no
damage other than a rip in my down jacket that spewed wisps of feathers  the
rest of the day.

Above the initial difficulty, the climbing eased as it  went  up  a  groove,
and then curved right to a spacious belay and rappel station. Matt went  all
the way to here on his first lead. Jim led the second team of four  and  had
to break it into two belays due to shorter ropes. Above the  rappel  station
was a fun lieback then easier terrain to the fairly roomy ledge right  below
the pointed summit. All six of us were able to hang out there. We found  the
register which had last been signed in 2009. We arrived at 4:00 and  started
down at 4:30 (4600 ft, 8 hrs).

We did two single rappels to the large ledge below  the  lieback,  then  one
double rope which easily reached to the col. That  took  about  an  hour.  A
fantastic glissade got us rapidly down much of  the  snow.  We  reached  the
cars at 8:00 where Mike and Matt said goodbye. The rest of  us  returned  to
Klipchuck for a celebratory evening around a campfire for a  most  enjoyable
end to a very enjoyable climb.

Columbia Gorge Peaks

With the weather being so iffy lately that I  couldn\'t  put  two  good  days
together back to back, I headed south to the Columbia Gorge on two  separate
car camping trips. I still got rained on but  probably  less  than  anywhere
else in the state and I managed one good weather day  for  each  trip.  This
area deserves its reputation for scenic beauty  and  is  well  worth  repeat
visits.

Thursday, May 31

Dog Mtn (2948 ft - P1148 -  Mt  Defiance  Quad)  -  Dog  Mtn  is  an  iconic
Columbia  Gorge  peak  famous  for  its  spectacular  early  season   flower
displays. It did not disappoint despite my arriving to drizzle  and  fog  at
the TH. The massive fields  of  arrowleaf  balsamroot  on  the  open  summit
slopes were some of the best I have ever seen but I was  also  impressed  by
the beauty of the lower forest. The fog even nicely cleared  a  bit  on  the
way down. I went up the "old trail" and down the "new" for a loop trip  (7.3
miles, 2900 ft and 4:30 hrs).

Wind Mtn (1907 ft - P947 - Carson Quad) - Wind   Mtn  is  an  archaeological
preserve that was used for vision quests by Native Americans and as such  is
a scared place. I was racing darkness to  the  summit  which  added  to  the
mystical experience for me. There is a (normally) nice trail up the NE  side
but unfortunately recent storms have not treated it kindly  and  there  were
numerous large windfalls that had to be climbed over or around  (2.8  miles,
1100 ft and 1:35 hr).

I then drove on to Beacon Rock State park to spend  the  night.  This  is  a
lovely campground set in old grove forest. It is  a  little  pricey  for  my
taste ($22/night with no break for seniors) but does have all the  amenities
like hot running water and showers. A Discover Pass is required in  addition
to the camping fee. The weather cleared during the night and  the  next  day
dawned partly sunny and warm.

Friday, June 1

Hamilton Mtn (2438 ft - P318 - Beacon Rock Quad) - Beacon  Rock  State  Park
is much more than just Beacon Rock.  It  is  a  large  park  with  miles  of
trails. One is the trail up Hamilton Mtn. This can be accessed  from  either
the campground or a large parking lot and picnic area slightly  lower.  Both
require a Discover Pass. The flower displays were not as showy  as  Dog  Mtn
but the upper rocky cliffs more than compensated for this.  The  trail  also
goes past impressive Rodney Falls. Many hikers  never  get  beyond  here.  I
went up the Hamilton Mtn trail, which is quite steep,  and  down  the  Hardy
Creek trail, which is longer and less steep with much of  it  on  old  road.
This made another nice loop trip (8.2 miles, 2300 ft and 5 hrs).

Wednesday, June 6

Table Mtn (3417 ft - P377 - Bonneville Dam Quad) - Table Mtn is  responsible
for The Bridge of the Gods when centuries ago a massive landslide  slid  off
it and dammed the Columbia River. I had a look at this  peak  from  Hamilton
and was back less than a week later to climb it on the  only  good  forecast
day of the week. I started from the Dick Thomas Trail that can  be  accessed
from the Bonneville Hot Springs gravel lot to the NW. This trail  intersects
an old road in about a mile which is then followed another 1.5 miles to  the
PCT. From there it is .2 miles to the  Table  Mtn  Heartbreak  Ridge  Trail.
Evidently this trail is notorious for its steepness.  I  actually  found  it
quite good but then my standards are low as I am used  to  climber\'s  trails
or no trail at all. I even enjoyed the  section  that  goes  straight  up  a
talus slope for 300 ft.  Shortly below the top I took the side trail to  the
Gorge Overlook at the edge of sheer cliffs. I then  followed  the  ridge  to
the flat summit area and returned on the Westway Trail, slightly less  steep
than the Heartbreak. It should be pointed out that the Bonneville  Dam  Quad
has 80 ft contours and so to those of us used to 40 ft  contours  everything
looks less steep on the map than it really is.

Aldrich Butte (1141 ft - P341 - Bonneville Dam Quad) - On  the  return  from
Table I hiked the old road up this peak to  an  ancient  WWII  defense  site
with crumbling concrete foundations. Views were limited due  to  encroaching
trees. Total for both peaks: 10.2 miles, 4100 ft and 7:20 hrs

I then drove road CG2020 north of Stevenson about 7.5 miles to the  five-way
intersection at the saddle between  Greenleaf  and  Birkenfeld.  This  is  a
rough steep road with many waterholes. A high clearance 4X4 is  recommended.
I had hoped to car  camp  at  the  saddle  but  found  nothing  suitable  so
continued on the spur toward Greenleaf where I found a  wide  spot  to  park
under the power line swath.

Thursday, June 7

Greenleaf Pk (3422 ft - P702 - Bonneville Dam Quad) - I awoke to heavy  rain
at 5:30. I went back to sleep for a couple of hours and dreamed my  car  was
towed. This prompted me to bite the bullet and get going  before  I  had  an
even worse dream. Actually the hike up Greenleaf was quite pleasant  despite
the rain. I followed the power line road to the ridge where I stumbled  upon
an old trail that looked to me as though it were  built.  Sure  enough  just
below the summit I came across a derelict  cabin  which  accounted  for  the
trail (1 mile, 775 ft and 1:20 hr).

Birkenfeld Mtn (3763 ft - P1563 - Beacon Rock Quad) - Back at the  saddle  I
took Rd 2026 toward Birkenfeld for 1.4 miles which  seemed  longer  as  this
road was even rougher and rockier than 2020.  I  parked  below  a  swath  of
forest that I thought would offer the most brush free route  to  the  ridge.
On the ridge I picked up the PCT which I then left too soon to go up  the  S
ridge (quite brushy). I returned on the less brushy W ridge. If there  is  a
trail up this peak  I  never  found  it.  Since  there  were  zero  views  I
concentrated on flora and was fortunate to see the rare  chocolate  lily  (2
miles, 850 ft and 2:30 hrs).

Rock Cr Butte (1934 ft - P414 - Bonneville Dam Quad) - I  drove  CG2000  and
the road up Rock Creek Butte (both very good roads) to the  intersection  on
the SW side. Both roads are blocked from here. I hiked up the spur that  led
almost to the top but it is so overgrown as to be more trouble  than  it  is
worth. It is easier to ascend straight up the hill  from  the  intersection.
This is the way I  came  down.  It  had  stopped  raining  by  now  and  was
beginning to clear enough that I had a decent view of Greenleaf through  the
trees. But the highlight of this trip was almost stepping on a  fawn  hiding
right smack on the summit waiting for its  Mom  to  return.  They  are  well
trained not to move a muscle  and  give  away  their  existence.  I  quickly
snapped a photo and retreated before causing it further  distress.  This  is
only the second time in my life I  have  been  treated  to  such  a  special
moment (.5 miles, 400 ft, 1 hr).

With no dry gloves left and rain forecast again for Friday  I  headed  home.
But    I    will    be    back.     I     really     like     this     area.

Twin Lakes BM (5301 ft - P581), "Stolen Thunder" (5045 ft  -  P405)  and  Pk
5113 (P393) - Mt Townsend Quad - June 14-16, 2012

Stefan and company had climbed the  first  two  of  these  peaks  this  past
winter on a day trip by approaching via the steep trail from  the  S  Tunnel
Cr TH. I planned on approaching from the better trail of the N Tunnel Cr  TH
and taking a more leisurely three days by camping  somewhere  near  Harrison
Lake. Stefan named Stolen Thunder on his trip. Again I had to make  do  with
a  short  weather  window  during  this  spring   of   continued   unsettled
conditions.

Thursday, June 14: Pk 5113 - Buoyed by partial clearing and the prospect  of
some sunshine  on  the  drive  over,  I  was  dismayed  that  it  turned  to
consistent fog and drizzle by the time I arrived at  the  TH.  Though  never
very heavy, it persisted for the rest of the day. I began running into  snow
about .5 miles before the shelter where it was pretty solid. After  crossing
Tunnel Creek on a footlog, the  trail  became  mostly  snowfree  again  once
above the valley floor and easily followed to the first of the  twin  lakes,
Karnes Lake which was completely under  snow  as  was  the  slightly  higher
Harrison Lake. Not able to find any obvious bare ground here to camp  on,  I
continued to 5050 Pass hoping something on  the  south  side  of  the  ridge
would be melted out. I found nothing so returned to Harrison Lake (4700  ft)
where at least I had running water. And to my delight, after some  searching
around, I located a bare flat spot, under a tree, just large enough  for  my
tent.

After setting up camp, I did the short easy climb up  Pk  5113  via  the  SW
ridge. No problem other then the wet brush that soaked  both  my  pants  and
gloves. I had zero  views.  I  fell  asleep  that  night  listening  to  the
constant drip, drip, drip on my tent  fly  and  thinking  if  things  didn\'t
improve come morning I was out of here.

To camp: 5 miles, 2300 ft and 4 hrs           Up Pk 5113:  1  mile,  500  ft
and 1:20 hrs RT

Friday, June 15: Twin Lakes BM and Stolen Thunder - Things did  improve.  In
fact I woke up to blue skies. In fact I was able to dry my pants  enough  in
the sun while having breakfast that it wasn\'t total repulsion  putting  them
on.

My objective peaks were not all that much higher than my  camp  but  getting
to each entailed a lot of up and down. First  I  had  to  get  to  the  main
ridge. I decided to try a direct traverse to  saddle  1  at  4680  ft.  That
didn\'t work too well as I had to drop over 300  feet  and  deal  with  steep
hillside to get past cliffs. Once at saddle  1,  I  elected  to  climb  Twin
Lakes BM first which I did by following the ridge the whole  way,  easy  and
pleasant although it did entail climbing over a  sub  peak.   And  why  this
ridge was mostly snowfree while the one by 5050 Pass was not I am not  quite
sure.

I reached the summit at 11:30 (850 ft, 2:40 hrs) and stayed for  the  better
part of an hour having lunch in the sun and enjoying  the  magnificent  view
of the east face of Mt Constance.

I found an old film can register dated 1981. It  was  in  surprisingly  good
shape for being 30 years old but only had the one entry. It was well  buried
and I would have missed  it  myself  had  I  not  been  turning  over  rocks
building a cairn for my own register next to the bench mark.  I  would  have
left it alone but since it had no pencil I decided to leave mine along  with
it. A register is useless if  it  cannot  be  signed  and  it  has  been  my
experience most climbers do not carry pencils.

From Twin Lakes BM I didn\'t want to reclimb the sub peak so  again  tried  a
direct route to the next saddle 2. Again I had  to  drop  below  cliffs  but
travel was reasonable and I think it was easier than staying on  the  ridge.
Once at saddle 2 the nature of the ridge changed.  It  started  as  pleasant
forest but soon deteriorated to gosh awful rhododendron  jungle.  For  those
not familiar with eastern Olympic rhododendrons trust me  when  I  say  they
are as bad, or even worse, than slide alder.  They  grow  as  thick  and  in
addition have branches that go every which way  and  entwine  you  in  their
snare. I was slowed by this obnoxious stuff until  eventually  breaking  out
into the increasingly rocky and cliffy area near the summit.  I  dropped  to
the south slope to bypass a first cliff, got back  on  the  crest  and  then
soon came upon the final pinnacle mentioned by Stefan. I  tried  going  over
the top but in the end took Stefan\'s route by dropping down the north  side.
This was the only place I needed and used my ice axe. I reached  the  summit
of Stolen Thunder at 3:40 (2350 ft, 6:50 hr). I built both a cairn and  left
a register.

By now the weather  was  beginning  to  change  and  Constance  was  already
obscured by clouds. The window had been  short  indeed.  For  the  return  I
stuck on the ridge the entire way and arrived back at camp at 8:00.

Total: 5.5 miles, 3450 ft and 11:15 hrs

Saturday, June 16 - I fully expected to wake  to  rain  and  was  pleasantly
surprised when I did not. I even made it all the way to the  TH  before  any
weather hit (2:30 hrs out).

Trip Total: 16.5 miles and 6600 ft in 3 days

Wednesday, June 20 - Beginning from the Enchanted Valley TH (elev  600  ft),
I hiked the 4 miles to Fire Cr where I left the trail to go up the ridge  on
the right-hand side. I was able to follow a faint way trail  for  the  first
1000 feet or so after which I lost it. I ran into  minor  brush  and  it  is
quite steep and slow  going  with  a  full  pack,  but  overall  this  is  a
reasonable route. At 3300 feet the hillside leveled out a bit and I found  a
comfy bare spot to camp near a small creek. It would have been nicer to  get
farther but I had gotten a late start so it was already 7:40  by  this  time
and time to stop. However, I felt I had gotten close enough to  be  able  to
climb my peaks the next day. This was just before the snowline.

Total: 5.5 miles, 3100 ft and 6:10 hrs

Thursday, June 21 - From my camp I continued up alongside Fire  Creek,  soon
running into solid snow, to a large basin at  3800  ft  ringed  by  a  cliff
band. A gully on the left provided a way through  the  cliffs  to  an  upper
basin and easy snow slopes to 5150 Fires Cr notch.  From  the  notch  I  had
great view into the heart of the wild Olympics where few people  venture.  I
wished I had more time to travel the inviting terrain toward July  10th  Pk,
and beyond. But for now my goal was to get up Muncaster, which I  could  not
yet see. The climber\'s guide was a bit vague in describing  the  route  only
saying to drop "a few hundred feet" to an open basin. What  the  heck  is  a
few hundred feet? Since it then said to contour to regain  the  ridge  at  a
5000 ft saddle I took that to mean you drop to 5000 ft or about 150  ft.  So
I did just that to get past the initial cliffs of the notch after  which  an
easy snow slope appeared to lead back to the ridge. Well it wasn\'t  as  easy
as it looked.  I made it to the ridge but I then  could  see  Muncaster  and
that I was too high and above where I supposed to be and had to  descend  to
the aforementioned 5000 ft saddle.  I really think I was totally  off  route
and should have descended farther to begin with, probably an  additional  5-
600 ft.

From the 5000 ft saddle the climber\'s guide now says to "traverse  right  to
the NE face".  The only problem was there was a continuous  band  of  cliffs
on the E ridge barring access to the NE face. The guide made no  mention  of
cliffs and I saw no easy way through these  cliffs  without  a  considerable
drop of nearly 1000 ft. The only possibility was a high  snow  traverse  and
that looked rather iffy as I saw several discontinuities. Still,  I  decided
to go for it. It started well but about halfway across I began running  into
problems. The snow was very steep and exposed with no run out over  vertical
cliffs and I would have to descend a bit to get past gullies. So  instead  I
went up with the terrain getting more and more difficult.  At  one  point  I
saw a goat above me. He was probably laughing at  me  as  at  this  point  I
realized I was so NOT on route it was funny and things were going  from  bad
to worse. I knew where I had to be, i.e. the NE face, but  I  just  couldn\'t
seem to get there. Yet somehow I managed  to  force  a  way,  several  times
squirming through thick trees just so I had  something  to  hang  onto,  and
emerged onto the E ridge. Another 100  feet  of  steep  but  straightforward
snow put me on the summit at 2:30, much later than I  had  hoped  (3400  ft,
6:40 hrs).

I stayed on the summit over 30 minutes. I found and left no register as  the
high point was all snow. I was now faced with how to get down. No way was  I
going down the way I came up. If worse  came  to  worse  I  would  take  the
considerable drop. I started down the E ridge until I was more or less  even
with the snow traverse of my way up.  I could now see it might go and so  it
did. It seemed less difficult in this direction. I had some up and  down  in
and out of gullies and one particularly  steep  snow  traverse  but  it  was
better than my up route. I do think this is the route and that it  would  be
easier with less snow when more of the goat trails I came across are  melted
out.

I then essentially followed my high route back to Fire Creek notch  since  I
was familiar with it. I still think it would  probably  be  better  to  drop
father below the notch but I am not sure as I did not do that.  There  could
be hidden cliffs to get by. In any event I was back to the  notch  at  6:20.
It was getting late but I still really wanted to climb Fire Cr  Pk.  It  was
so close. I crossed through the notch and climbed easy snow to the  base  of
the west face rock. It looked broken enough to be scrambleable.  And  so  it
was, though marginally so and not a lot of fun. From the top of the  snow  I
went up some slabs to a chimney/gully that led to the W ridge. The floor  of
this deep slot was steep wet dirt that was so  slick  it  gave  no  reliable
purchase for my feet. I struggled up often using heather on  the  sides  for
hand holds to pull on. I thought things  would  improve  at  the  top.  They
didn\'t. They were replaced by struggling  through  thick  cedar  pulling  on
branches. There must be a better way up this  peak  that  involves  pleasant
rock scrambling but I didn\'t have the time to seek it  out.  I  reached  the
summit at 7:30 (4800 ft, 11:40 hrs). At least the views were nice.  I  built
a cairn, as none existed, and left a register.

I slithered down through the trees and rappelled the  slot.  Then  was  fast
fast fast down the snow. I  reached  my  tent  at  9:35  without  needing  a
headlamp. Thank heavens for the long days of the solstice.

Total: 6 miles, 4800 ft, 13:45 hrs

Friday, June 22 - I fully expected to hear rain on my tent during the  night
as the latest forecast had indicated, so when I awoke at 5:30 to  none  yet,
just clouds and fog I was very pleased and inspired  to  get  moving  faster
than usual. I quickly got ready, broke camp and was on my way  before  7:00.
It would have been miserable to descend that steep ridge to the  Quinault  R
Trail in the rain. I almost made it all the way out  before  the  rain  hit,
only having light precip the last mile to the car.

Day Total: 5.5 miles, 500 ft and 3:50 hrs

Trip Total: 17 miles and 8400 ft in 3 days

Mt Hoquiam (4909 ft - P229 - Mt Hoquiam Quad) - June 27-28, 2012

Wednesday, June 27 - I thought this would be a  simple  little  trip  easily
fit into 1.5 days but things didn\'t go as  smoothly  as  expected  (do  they
ever?).  My daughter had been visiting for over a  week  and  departed  just
the day before which left me totally unorganized and led to  a  late  start.
Then I ran into snow on the approach road (Rd  2270)  above  Wynoochee  Lake
beginning at 2900 ft. I was able to push through several patches to make  it
another mile to 3300 but this was still short of where I wanted to be.  Will
this snow never melt? So I had to hike an additional mile to  the  beginning
of my route. I left the road where it crossed  the  stream  exiting  from  a
small pond following Route 2 in the climber\'s guide but in  retrospect  this
is not the best way to go. I ran into steep slick brushy forest  getting  to
the pond and the spur ridge above it. This turned out to be rocky and I  had
to descend to get off it. And the traverse past Pt 4520 to the ONP  boundary
ridge had lots of ups and downs and was very slow going.  So  I  reached  my
planned campsite in the SE basin below Hoquiam at  the  late  hour  of  5:00
(2.5 miles, 1450 ft, 3:15 hrs) considering I still wanted to climb my  peak.
Then I discovered the basin was totally snowed in.  I  really  thought  some
bare meadow would be melted out by now but the best I could find was a  tiny
spot in a grove of trees. However, there was no running water  to  be  found
anywhere. It was all locked beneath the snow. Despite all  it  was  still  a
pleasant camp.

I quickly set up my tent  and  took  off  for  Hoquiam  at  5:50  worried  I
wouldn\'t have enough daylight  left.  I  took  my  large  collapsible  water
bottle along hoping to find running water somewhere along the way but  never
did. Finally I just filled it with snow and set it in the sun  to  at  least
partially melt by my return.  I easily crossed the basin, which  I  am  sure
would be lovely meadows later in the season, to the S ridge of Pt 4640.  The
ridge crest was snow free. A gully slightly to the right gave a way  through
the upper cliffs to the top. I descended open snow on the other side to  the
saddle with Hoquiam. I regained the S ridge which  was  very  narrow,  rocky
and covered with thick twisted trees. I soon left my poles as  they  were  a
real impediment but kept my axe as I had seen snow higher  up.  Sure  enough
after battling through the brush I was forced to go right below cliffs  onto
a snow traverse that led up and around left to the summit  rocks.  A  simple
scramble then put me on the summit at 7:30 (950 ft, 1:40  hrs).  I  found  a
large (dry) register placed in 2007. A total of 10  parties  had  signed  in
during the 5 years. I left the summit at 8:15 after enjoying  the  view  and
trying, mostly unsuccessfully, to identify the sea of inner  Olympic  peaks.
I was back to camp just before dark at 9:30 (2  miles,  1150  ft,  3:40  hrs
RT).

Thursday, June 28 - Rain was forecast to move in today about noon. I  didn\'t
have far to go to get out so I slept in, took  my  time  getting  ready  and
even painted a picture, my first in a while.  Usually  I  neither  have  nor
take the time for such a luxury. It was nice not to be in a rush. I  finally
left at 10:00. Not wishing to repeat my in route,  once  I  gained  the  ONP
boundary ridge I dropped straight down to  the  road.  This  seemed  a  much
better route to me despite having to lose additional elevation. I  did  have
to climb several hundred feet up the road to get back to my car (2.5  miles,
550 ft 2 hrs). However, when the snow is  melted  you  could  drive  to  and
start directly from this lower road. I did get out before any rain hit.

Mt Torment Attempt (8120+ ft - P200 - Forbidden Pk Quad) - July 5-7, 2012

I was both too early and too late for this peak via the SE  face,  the  only
route I thought I was capable of soloing. How could this be  you  ask?  Well
easy in this crazy weather  year.  I  was  too  late  for  the  moat  to  be
crossable and I was too early for the recent snow to  have  consolidated.  I
knew going into this that my chances of soloing this peak were iffy.  I  did
have gorgeous weather but good weather does not  always  translate  to  good
climbing conditions.

Thursday, July 5 - There were several cars parked at  the  Boston  Basin  TH
but not as many as  expected  considering  the  warm  sunshine  and  holiday
weekend. It was a slow grunt up the steep  trail,  especially  since  I  was
carrying so much technical gear (rope, rack, crampons). I had my  first  bad
omen when I met a guide coming out. She reported not being  able  to  summit
Sahale due to bad snow and an ominous cornice. Her 3 clients had elected  to
stay another day.  Then  I  met  2  rangers.  They  too  reported  bad  snow
conditions with it having snowed 3-4 feet the previous week  at  the  higher
elevations. They also said Boston Basin was completely  snowed  in  with  no
bare campsites but that they were able to dig out the toilet  at  the  lower
camp. I ran into solid snow beginning about 5000 ft. I  stopped  briefly  to
chat with the clients still at the lower camp (5600  ft).  There  were  some
bare spots for sitting and cooking (none big enough for  a  tent)  but  they
were spread out covering most of them so I decided to keep going. I found  a
reasonable site at 6200 ft that I ended up sharing with a  resident  marmot.
It took me about 30 minutes to level a spot in the  snow  with  my  ice  axe
large enough for my tiny bivy tent.

Total: 3 miles, 3100 ft, 6 hrs.

Friday, July 6 - I was awakened by a party of 3  heading  for  the  Torment-
Forbidden Traverse. Good. I wouldn\'t have to break trail. They were about  2
hours ahead of me. I followed their footsteps up the Taboo Glacier to  where
they diverged to go  to  the  South  Ridge  Notch,  their  chosen  route  up
Torment. I was headed to the SE Face. Beckey states that after  July  1  the
moat above the Taboo Glacier can be difficult. Somehow  I  thought  that  in
this high snow year it would be in condition longer. That was not the  case.
It went all the way across and I knew I was in trouble. I dinked around  for
over an hour searching for a way across but  this  is  one  nasty  moat.  In
places it was such a deep dark dank bottomless pit that it scared  the  sh..
out of me. I am becoming convinced that a high snow year does NOT make  moat
crossings last longer and easier but simply makes them bigger and deeper.

I did eventually find a way across the moat on questionable bridges  to  the
far right but then I could not traverse back left above the moat  to  regain
the route. My only option was to continue straight up  on  broken  rock  and
hope to traverse higher up. This might have worked and  I  wasn\'t  the  only
one with this idea as I came across a  hex  in  a  crack.  But  I  ended  up
stopped by an icy chimney. I began hacking steps and a  chunk  of  ice  came
off and hit me in the knee. Not incapacitating but  then  I  heard  a  slide
come down from somewhere near the East Ridge notch. I watched as it  bounced
down over the moat and onto the glacier below. I was in a safe  spot  but  I
saw the handwriting on the wall. I had had enough. It just wasn\'t  meant  to
be. On the rappel down I heard two more smaller slides or rockfalls.  And  I
heard voices of the traverse party above me. They did  not  sound  happy.  I
not sure what was going on with them but I doubt it was anything good.  They
may even have been the cause of some of those slides. I could see they  were
traversing off the S Ridge and were high on the SE  Face  and  had  not  yet
summitted Torment.

I turned around about 1:30 and was back to camp by 3:00. I  didn\'t  want  to
go out this day so to fill the rest of  it  I  decided  to  wander  over  to
Sharkfin Tower and check it out. Possibly I could still get up it  though  I
doubted it. In 2 hours I was at the base of that peak\'s  access  gully.  For
the last hour I had watched a party of 4 on the snow slope above the  gully.
I was really puzzled as to what they were doing.  They  didn\'t  seem  to  be
moving very fast and they were way left of the up route. This could  not  be
good. As luck would have it I reached the gully  just  as  they  started  to
rappel down it. Again there was a moat but it could be bypassed on  rock  to
the left. I was preparing to go that way when a slide  came  down  over  the
rock. I then made contact with the lead climber. They were  just  trying  to
get off the peak and had rappelled directly off the summit (not down the  up
route). He reported the snow was very unstable. So once again I turned  tail
and returned to camp where I had a pleasant 2 hours in  the  sun  before  it
set behind the ridge. I noticed that there were  fresh  tracks  coming  back
from the direction of Torment while I had been gone. If I  had  to  guess  I
would say the traverse party  bailed  on  continuing  to  Forbidden.  I  was
beginning to wonder how many other climbers  ran  into  difficulties  during
this weekend.

Total: 4.5 miles, 3000 ft and 8:40

Saturday, July 7 - One more note on the trip out. It was uneventful for  me.
However, just after I reached the old mine road I was surprised to run  into
a French family hiking up  the  trail.  The  two  kids  were  young  and  in
tennies. The parents didn\'t have much better gear either.  I  tried  to  ask
gently if they were in the right  place or really wanted  the  Cascade  Pass
trail. I tried to explain this was a  difficult  climber\'s  trail  but  they
would have none of it or maybe they didn\'t understand me. I probably  should
have minded my own business. Maybe they really  did  want  an  adventure  of
their own. In any event they would soon figure it out as just a  short  ways
on the "trail" left the old road and became very steep and nasty.

So in the end I climbed nothing. Yet I felt oddly satisfied with  the  trip.
I camped in a fantastic alpine setting and essentially traversed the  entire
length of beautiful Boston Basin. And that counts for something.

Trip Total: 10.5 miles and 6100 ft in 3 days

The Brothers, North Peak (6650 ft - The Brothers Quad) - July 13 - 15, 2012

Sandbagged once again by the Olympic Mountains  Climbing  Guide.  This  peak
turned into more of a challenge than the brief description  of  Route  1  in
the guide would indicate. Class 3 turned out to be class 5 and  snow  slopes
of 20-30 degrees became 45 degrees. However, I must say the listed  time  of
9 hours from Lena Forks was fairly accurate. None the less it was a  classic
Olympic alpine adventure that Jim and I both thoroughly enjoyed.

Friday, July 13 - The plan was for me get a head start by hiking  into  Lena
Lake the night before and meet Jim, Eileen and Lisa  the  following  day  at
Lena Forks. From there we would continue on to  bivy  somewhere  near  Lunch
Rock. Then Eileen and Lisa  would  climb  South  Brother  while  Jim  and  I
tackled North Brother.  I first climbed West Rock (4211 ft -  P371  -  Eldon
Quad) from the end of the upper spur of Cabin Creek Road  (2.5  miles,  1400
ft, 4:20 hrs RT). I ran into brief thunder showers  that  made  the  initial
rhododendron brush wet and unpleasant but the summit itself was  lovely  and
a nice viewpoint for the route up North Brother.

By the time I started up the Lena Lake trail it was 6:30.  The  parking  lot
was a total zoo. I reached the  lake  at  8:30  where  I  found  every  tent
campsite taken but since I was in a bivy I was  able  to  use  a  tiny  spot
along Lena Creek just past the bridge (3 miles, 1300 ft, 2 hrs).

Saturday, July 14 - In no hurry, I slowly strolled up the  trail  along  the
East Fork of Lena Creek through the Valley of  Silent  Men.  With  its  moss
covered boulders and waterfalls this has to be one  of  the  most  beautiful
low valleys in all of the Olympics. It is worth a trip in itself and  I  was
happy to go at a pace where I could enjoy it to its fullest. Going  at  half
speed and with one long stop to soak aching body parts in the cold water  of
the creek I reached Lena Forks camp at noon (3 miles, 1300 ft, 3:30 hrs).  I
had 2.5 hours to eat lunch and relax before the others showed  up  at  2:30.
Meanwhile there was more thunder but no rain materialized.

Regrouping we all started up the usual  South  Brother  route  at  3:30  and
found a small but adequate spot above Lunch Rock for the four of us to  bivy
at 7:00, elev 5500 ft (1.5 miles, 2500 ft, 3:30 hrs  from  Lena  Forks).  We
did have to share it with a family of five  mountain  goats,  two  of  which
were adorable babies.

Day Total: 7.5 miles and 3800 ft

Sunday, July 15 - We started at 7:00, Eileen and  Lisa  for  South  Brother,
Jim and I for North. From our bivy we diverged from the South Brother  route
almost immediately heading right and up. The first problem  was  to  get  to
the SE spur at a point that could be descended on the other  side  into  the
eastern Great Basin. The guide gives no  clue  as  to  what  elevation  this
would be. All began well with a series of easy class 2-3 ramps  and  we  had
visions of making the summit early. Then it all fell  apart.  Following  the
line of least resistance we hit the SE  spur  at  about  6200  ft  but  were
dismayed to discover we could not descend the other side.  We  saw  we  were
too high and would have to be about 200 feet lower but getting there was  no
easy task. We ran into pinnacles, deep gullies  and  cliffs.  After  several
false leads with sketchy scrambling, Jim found a key ledge  that  led  to  a
lower 6000 ft notch at 9:20. There was a large cairn here so we  had  to  be
at the right place.

Looking into the Great Basin it looked easy once on the snow  but  again  it
didn\'t turn out that way. We did  descend  from  the  notch  with  no  great
difficulty, first on a heather rib then on the steep  snow  finger  next  to
it. We put on crampons for this  last  and  were  glad  we  had.  We  easily
crossed the upper Great Basin until past cliffs and could  climb  up  toward
the summit. The upper snow finger became increasingly steep. 20-30  degrees?
I don\'t think so. The finger ended in a gully where we came across a  frayed
sling. There were a few difficult moves to get to easier stuff  after  which
we scrambled to the ridge  above.  Somewhere  about  here  we  heard  shouts
coming from the South Brother. We assumed that was Eileen and  Lisa  but  by
now the originally forecast sunny day had deteriorated to fog and  mist  and
we could not see far. About this time we also heard the  unmistakable  sound
of a large avalanche somewhere below.

Now the question was which of the several pinnacles on  the  ridge  was  the
summit? I relied on Jim to figure that out. We scrambled to the right  along
the crest over huge blocks, in and out, up and down, quite  interesting  but
also slow going. Finally at the base of what Jim  chose  as  the  summit  we
could see no easy way up. It was definitely class 5 and all  we  had  was  a
rope, one prusik and one sling. Due to a miscommunication the  other  slings
were with Lisa and Eileen. How to get up this thing?  Well  fortunately  the
pinnacle was not that high and could be accessed from several sides. So  Jim
threw the rope over the top and we used the prusik as a belay. Jim  went  up
first and then me. We were ecstatic to find a register on top  which  proved
we were on the right pinnacle. It was an  old  Mountaineer  register  dating
back to 1974. Our only disappointment was we had no views and could not  see
to the South Brother. It was noon.

Thirty minutes later we were ready to leave. The mist had turned to  drizzle
and the rock was getting wet and slick. Using our  one  sling  we  rappelled
down the gully to the old frayed sling which we then used to  get  onto  the
snow. Fortunately it held. We downclimbed the snow  by  backing  down.  Near
the bottom of the steep part I tried facing out. A step broke out  and  down
I went. I was shocked that it took a good 50  feet  for  my  self-arrest  to
completely stop me. The snow was so soft that the pick just  sliced  through
very gradually slowing me down.  After  that  it  was  backing  down  again.
Passing under the cliffs we came across evidence of  the  avalanche  we  had
heard. It appeared that a massive snow block  perched  high  above  had  let
loose. The debris completely covered our up tracks. I  hate  to  think  what
would have happened had we been there at that time.

We were back to the SE spur notch at 2:30. We  did  one  more  short  rappel
using the rope around a tree at a  dicey  spot  then  it  was  careful  down
climbing. What would have been easy in dry conditions  took  extra  care  on
the wet slick rock. We reached our bivy at 3:40 where  everything  was  wet.
Eileen and Lisa were long gone as it  had  been  prearranged  that  I  would
drive Jim home. We packed quickly and left at 4:10. The rest of the  day  is
a blur of tired muscles and aching feet.  Lena Forks at 6:10, Lena  Lake  at
8:00 and the TH at 10:00. But hey, it did stop drizzling.

Day Total: 9.5 miles, 2400 ft and 15 hrs

West Challenger (8000+ ft) -Mt Challenger Quad - July 21-28, 2012

Going into this trip I knew it was unlikely I would  get  all  three  of  my
main objectives - West Challenger, Crooked Thumb and  Phantom.  The  Pickets
have a way of humbling climbers and wrecking havoc with  agendas.  Yet  even
though things didn\'t exactly go as planned I count this trip as  one  of  my
best ever and a truly sublime alpine  experience  shared  with  two  special
friends. I couldn\'t have asked for better companions than Beth  and  Eileen.
And the fact that we three pulled  it  off  on  our  own  made  it  all  the
sweeter. I am still  digesting  the  experience,  much  of  which  was  very
personal and cannot adequately be expressed in words.  I will have to  limit
myself to a brief summary for the purposes of this TR.

Day 0 - We caught the 5:30 pm boat up Ross Lake to camp  at  Big  Beaver  in
the company of good friends - Jim, Derek, Steve,  Steve\'s  sister,  Deb  and
Janet.

Day 1 - Everyone else saw us off when they caught the  8:30  boat  to  climb
Desolation. Eileen, Beth and I spent the rest of the day  hiking  with  very
heavy packs 14 miles to Beaver Pass. This time I did not have the  advantage
of Tom to carry half my gear and I wasn\'t sure how I would do with all  that
weight. I did make it but it took its toll on various body parts.

Total: 14 miles, 2700 ft and 9:30 hrs

Day 2 - It began to rain during the night and continued into  late  morning.
We discussed options while lounging in our roomy 3-man  tent.  As  the  rain
began to let up we decided to go for it leaving at noon. I was  not  looking
forward to the steep brushy initial ascent to Eiley-Wiley ridge in the  wet.
Once we got going though it actually was not that bad  despite  not  picking
the best line up and running into a cliff band  (we  were  too  far  to  the
right). We were barely able to force a route through up a very  steep  slick
dirt gully. Once above that things improved as the ridge opened  up  and  we
followed the crest. We had a few  more  problems  in  route  finding  before
descending into the basin SE of Little Beaver Pk (6984)  where  we  found  a
nice tent site and water. It was still foggy but  had  stopped  raining.  We
went to bed not knowing what we would wake to in the morning.

Total: 2.5 miles, 3300 ft and 8 hrs

Day 3 - We awoke to glorious sunshine  and  a  full  view  of  the  Northern
Pickets. Unknowingly we had chosen a primo spot to camp. We dried out a  bit
in the sun before continuing on  our  way  at  9:30.  Again  we  had  a  few
problems route finding but nothing serious and worked our way, up and  down,
past both Eiley and Wiley Lakes to a lovely  campsite  on  a  heather  bench
just below Big Beaver Pk (7374) with a stunning view of Challenger at  3:00.
While I set up camp, Beth and Eileen rushed off to climb Challenger  (I  had
already climbed it). They reported  fresh  snow  on  top  that  caused  some
difficulties but working together sharing leads they summited at about  8:00
and returned at 10:15. Meanwhile I thoroughly enjoyed  a  restful  afternoon
in the sun in one of the most beautiful spots on earth.

Total: 3 miles, 2000 ft and 5:30 hrs (for me)

Day 4 - I naively thought we might still fit in my peaks  despite  our  lost
time. To this end Eileen and I started at 9:00 with bivy  gear  planning  to
climb West Challenger and have Beth meet us at  the  West  Challenger  notch
where we would then descend  to  the  basin  below  Crooked  Thumb.  But  we
totally underestimated West Challenger. Rated class 3 in  Beckey  I  thought
it would take only a couple of hours. It ended up taking over 8  hrs.  I  am
sure we did  not  always  go  the  best  way  but  we  did  follow  Beckey\'s
description which said to climb the W Ridge from  the  saddle  west  of  the
peak to a notch, rappel into the notch and cross a loose  knife  edged  rock
ridge to the main summit. We did all this but  I  still  shake  my  head  in
disbelief at what we encountered. First we ran into at  least  mid  class  5
very exposed climbing that put me at my limit. I do believe the  last  pitch
to above the notch was the hardest lead I have ever done.  Then  it  was  no
simple rappel to the notch but we had to go off to the side and  do  3  with
our 100 ft rope. That  put  us  about  100  feet  below  the  notch  in  the
cruddiest loosest scree  and  rock  gully  imaginable.  Eileen  and  I  took
different lines up this gully to avoid killing one other. She went up a  sub
gully on the far right which gave access to the summit block sooner. I  went
all the way to the knife edge at the gully  top  and  then  had  to  descend
slightly. I have never in my life seen such a feature  as  this  knife  edge
loose rock ridge. I marveled that it could  even  exist  without  completely
and instantly disintegrating. There  wasn\'t  a  solid  hold  anywhere.  Once
across the gully the last few hundred feet on the summit  block  were  quite
pleasant and true class 3. We reached  the  summit  at  6:00.  We  found  an
easier way down and were back to the West Challenger notch  where  Beth  was
patiently waiting for us. It was now obvious that neither Crooked Thumb  nor
Phantom were possible anymore.  I  was  totally  fried  and  had  passed  my
tolerance for loose rock. I felt the mountain gods  had  chewed  us  up  but
then spit us out in one piece. They might not be so kind again if we  pushed
for more. And so we retreated back to camp.

Total: 5 miles, 2600 ft and 11 hrs

Day 5 - The trip now morphed into  one  with  three  friends  enjoying  each
other\'s company while sharing the surreal beauty of the  Pickets.  We  slept
in, moved leisurely and took 3 days to go out. That was a refreshing  change
of pace from the usual climbing schedule of cramming as much into a  day  as
possible. It was also much easier on this aging body. I should  do  it  more
often. This day we returned to the same camp as Day 3 but first  climbed  to
the top of Little Beaver Pk.

Total: 3 miles, 1100 ft and 5:30 hrs.

Day 6 - We found a much better route off the  ridge  than  our  way  up  and
although it was quite steep forest there were no cliffs. We camped  at  Luna
with plenty of time to wash up in a real creek.

Total: 6.5 miles, 600 ft, 7:30 hrs

Day 7 - We were picked up by the boat at 3:30 and hiked the  mile  trail  up
to the car. And so ended our wonderful adventure. No I  didn\'t  get  all  my
peaks but that seems insignificant in comparison to what I did get. And  now
I have an excuse to return to what has become my favorite place on earth.

Total: 11 miles, 600 ft and 6:30 hrs

Grand Total: 45 miles  and  13,000  ft  in  7  days                      Fay

The Ptarmigan Traverse - August 4-11, 2012

I had done segments by coming in and out from both the north (Cascade  Pass)
and south (Downey Creek) several times to do various  peaks  but  had  never
done the entire Ptarmigan Traverse. I  was  missing  the  section  from  the
South Cascade Glacier to  the  Dome  Glacier.  So  when  Jim  organized  the
"classic" one way traverse I was keen to sign on. Since I had  already  done
most of the main peaks along the way I could  concentrate  on  the  traverse
itself, which is challenging and scenic enough in its own right. But  I  did
hope to add a few new peaks, most notably both Spire Point and  Gunsight.  I
did manage to get up the former (just barely)  but,  alas,  not  the  later.
However, I still consider the trip a great success and fantastic  experience
enhanced by the company of good friends.  Others  along  were  Jim,  Eileen,
Mike T, Steve  and  Deb  (she  did  a  great  job  with  her  first  glacier
experience), Kevin K and George. Peaks climbed (by me) along the way were:

Arts Knoll (7200+ ft - P280) - Cascade Pass Quad

Peak 7004 (P484) - Cascade Pass Quad

LeConte Mtn (7762 ft - P842) - Cascade Pass Quad

Lizard Mtn (7400+ ft - P440) - Dome Pk Quad

Spire Point (8264 ft - P784) - Dome Pk Quad

Day 0: August 4 - We spent a full half day doing the  car  shuttle.  It  was
lengthened by over two hours because  the  Suiattle  River  Road  was  still
closed between mile 2 and 8 and we had to take the annoying detour over  Rat
Trap Pass. We left 2 cars at the current road end at mile 12 and car  camped
at Mineral Cr Campground on the Cascade  River  Road  planning  to  leave  2
other cars at Cascade Pass the next day.

Day 1: August 5 - We started from the Cascade Pass  TH  at  7:30  on  a  hot
sunny day. I was very annoyed with myself when I discovered  30  minutes  up
the trail I had left my maps in the car and had to go back  for  them.  That
put me behind the group but I caught up  to  everyone  at  Mix-up  Arm.  The
Cache Glacier was easy travel and the moat at Cache Col no real problem.  We
pulled into still frozen Kool-Aid Lake at 2:40 to set  up  camp.  While  the
others "hurried" off to climb Hurry-Up Pk, Steve, Deb and I  lounged  around
camp and washed up in the icy lake. Two other parties showed up late in  the
day, but we never saw them again after the next day.

Total: 6.5 miles, 3200 ft and 6:30 hrs.

Day 2: August 6 - This day took us over the notorious (for  me)  Red  Ledge.
It was completely melted out and other than a steep snow approach  no  great
problem but I was still happy that I would not be  returning  this  way  and
hoped never again to have to cross it  in  my  lifetime.   At  Arts  Rib  we
dropped packs to scamper up the enjoyable heather ridge of Arts Knoll  where
we had an impressive view of both Hurry-Up and the north face of Spider  (RT
from pack drop: 800 ft, 1:20 hrs).

We continued on to the Middle  Cascade  Glacier  and  the  Spider-Formidable
Col, dropping down the other side to a lovely camp at  beautiful  Yang  Yang
Lakes. We arrived just in time to wash up before the sun left the valley.

Total: 6 miles, 2450 ft and 9 hrs.

Day 3: August 7 - I really wanted to climb LeConte Mtn as I  had  missed  it
on my previous trips. No one else seemed  interested  but,  Jim,  bless  his
heart, didn\'t want me to solo it, so agreed to accompany me. We  left  about
an hour earlier than the rest of the crew. Somehow we got  separated  (don\'t
ask) and we each gained the ridge by different routes  while  still  tucking
in Pk 7004 on the way to join up again at the base of  LeConte.  We  dropped
packs to scurry up the  peak.  After  some  steep  snow  we  gained  the  SE
shoulder and were confronted by a little more than we bargained for  with  a
steep exposed class 4 summit ridge.  It  looked  very  intimidating  but  we
managed to tease out a  scramble  route  without  using  the  rope.  It  was
actually a very enjoyable climb. I left a register (RT from our  pack  drop:
900 ft and 2 hrs).

While Jim hurried to catch up to everyone else (who had passed us),  I  hung
back with Mike who independently also climbed Pk 7004 and  was  waiting  for
me. We travelled together to The LeConte-Sentinel  Saddle  where  we  caught
the others just as they were leaving for Old Guard.  I  continued  on  above
the South Cascade Glacier to add Lizard Mtn (easy scramble, 450 ft and  1:15
hrs from pack drop) before again meeting everyone at Lizard  Pass.  We  then
dropped down steep snow and scree to camp at White Rock Lakes.

Total: 7 miles, 4600 ft and 12:50 hrs

Day 4: August 8 - It was quite windy all night and we awoke to  rolling  fog
which soon cleared. From the look of  all  the  rock  windbreaks  previously
built around campsites I would guess wind is common at this lake. We  picked
up a good trail out of the lake to traverse  toward  the  Dana  Glacier  but
soon lost it in talus. At the edge of the snow we took a  break  where  some
excitement  ensued  when  Eileen\'s  pack  rolled  down  a  waterfall  gully.
Disaster was averted when the pack was quickly retrieved  but  much  of  the
contents were soaked, though nothing critical (like the sleeping bag).

While the group took time to dry out the pack, Mike and I took off to  climb
Spire Point. We headed uphill toward Spire Col and dropped packs on  a  rock
rib at about 6900 ft. We reached the base of the rock at 8000  ft  at  2:45.
Somehow we completely missed the class 4 route and were led  astray  by  the
Beckey Route description (2nd Edition) which calls it the NE route and  says
to make a LONG rightward traverse on a wide ledge to a  trough  on  the  far
right. This we did. Mike made the first lead and immediately thought it  too
hard for class 4. But he found a rap station and brought me up. I  continued
the lead and passed a piton. This lured us on thinking we were on route  but
the climbing became harder and harder. I was stumped as to where to  go  and
soon at my limit. I  was  10  feet  above  my  last  pro  on  holdless  slab
literally hanging on my fingernails and wanting to retreat but  not  knowing
how to do that. This dilemma was solved by  me  suddenly  peeling  off.  The
next thing I knew I was hanging upside  down  20  feet  lower  spread-eagled
backward on the slab with the rope wrapped  tight  around  my  legs  and  me
unable to move. I think I scared the  bejeebers  out  of  Mike.  Fortunately
Mike gave me a good belay, my pro (a stopper) held and the  slab  was  clean
so I had minimal damage and was still functional. Somehow I managed  to  get
upright and extricate myself from the situation but that was it.  We  called
it quits and I was resigned to failing mere feet from the  summit.  We  were
on some route but certainly not the class 4 one and not  one  either  of  us
was capable of climbing.

While retreating along the ledge back to the  snow,  on  a  slightly  higher
line, I happened to glance up and there it was, the obvious class  4  route.
It was a very SHORT distance along the ledge and in the middle of  the  east
face and not to the NE as described. We just  didn\'t  look  for  it  in  the
right place. We scrambled up to the summit in  15  minutes.  We  did  rappel
down though. Our entire misadventure had taken  several  hours  longer  than
necessary and nearly cost me grave injury.  Interestingly when I got home  I
read the 3rd Edition of Beckey where he renamed the  route  the  East  Face.
Others must have complained about the description and confusion.

Moving fast once back on the snow, we made it to the Dana-Dome Col  and  our
intended campsite just  15  minutes  after  the  others  had  returned  from
climbing Dome Pk. Deb and Steve had been there all  afternoon  and  had  the
foresight to collect water for  all  of  us  which  was  sorely  needed  and
greatly appreciated.

Total: 5 miles, 3750 ft and 10:20 hrs

Day 5: August 9 - Gunsight was out. No one had the desire or energy at  this
point. So while Jim and Eileen took  off  for  some  quality  time  together
exploring around Dome Peak, the rest of us lounged around  camp  warming  up
in the sun after a cold night on snow. I examined more  closely  the  damage
done by my fall and was happy to discover it  no  worse  than  a  bad  thigh
bruise and stiff leg. Once again I was lucky. The mountain  gods  sure  seem
to be looking out for  me.  We  left  camp  around  noon.  I  took  my  time
travelling the familiar terrain (my fourth time) to Itswoot  Ridge  and  Cub
Lake. We had thought to camp at the lake but it  was  still  snowed  in  and
unappealing so we decided to continue on and found a very pleasant  spot  in
cushy meadow just before the trail drops to Bachelor Creek.

Total: 4 miles, 950 ft and 6 hrs.

Day 6: August 10 - Again familiar territory,  down  the  brush  of  Bachelor
Creek to Downey Creek and out to the Suiattle River Rd. Although I must  say
both trails are better than I remember. Usage has improved Bachelor  Cr  and
Downey Creek has had a lot of work done on it. However, both my feet and  my
bruised leg were hurting by the end. We camped that night along the road.

Total: 11 miles, 400 ft and 8:40 hrs.

Day 7, August 11  -  All  that  remained  was  the  9  mile  road  trip  and
retrieving the cars at Cascade Pass but that took most of the day.

Trip Total: 39.5 miles and 15,350 ft in 6 days

The Painted Traverse - August 17-19, 2012

Portal Peak (6999 ft - P479), Purple Pk (6910 ft - P370), Skullcap Pk  (6603
ft - P203), Black Mtn (7262 ft - P902), Magenta Mtn (6735  ft  -  P455)  and
Red (Painted) Mtn (6975 ft - P935) - Glacier Pk West and Sloan Pk Quads

The Painted Traverse is not a true traverse in the strictest  sense  of  the
word but really a loop as it starts and ends at the same TH.  This  made  it
ideal for me alone as no car shuttle was needed. I have long had  this  trip
on my agenda and in fact almost joined Matt B and Eric J on  their  trip  in
2010. But since they had planned to do  it  in  2  days,  I  declined.  They
actually ended up taking longer than they expected but I knew I  would  need
and want 3 full days. I found this trip to give a lot of bang for the  buck.
It makes a wonderful 3 day trip with much variety, great  scenery  and  some
routefinding challenges along the way. I love the colorful names  of  the  6
peaks I climbed along the way (there could be 7 if you include White  but  I
had climbed that on a previous trip).   I  found  registers  on  Portal  and
Skullcap and added mine to the other 4 peaks where I found none.

Day 1: Saturday, August 18 -  I  arrived  at  the  North  Fork  Sauk  TH  to
overflowing parking. Cars and horse trailers filled every  available  space.
This is why I don\'t like to go out on weekends but I was  forced  into  this
time frame by various commitments. I finally found a spot to  park  off  the
road under a tree at the far end of  the  campground.  From  the  number  of
vehicles I expected plenty of company but most of the activity  was  due  to
the Backcountry Horsemen working on the first 2 miles of  trail.  Once  past
this point the number of people and horses thinned considerable.

I took my time hiking the first 5  miles  of  gentle  trail,  which  was  in
excellent condition, to Mackinaw Shelter.  Once past here the  trail  tilted
up to gain 3000 ft to the junction with the PCT just before White Pass.  The
muggy heat was oppressive  and  the  biting  flies  very  annoying  in  this
section. Part way up two young fellows passed me and asked  if  I  knew  how
much farther it was to the top. I assumed they meant White Pass and  had  to
break it to them that they still had almost 2000 ft  to  go.  They  did  not
look happy but continued past me. Later I caught  up  to  them  again.  They
were waiting for the rest of their party. I cautioned  they  would  be  hard
pressed to get to White Pass before dark as it was now 6:30, they still  had
1000 ft to go and their party was nowhere in sight. I really felt sorry  for
them but there was nothing I could do to help and I was running out of  time
myself.  I reached the PCT junction at 7:30 and continued  on  to  Red  Pass
arriving at 8:00. I found a nice campsite with  running  water  and  even  a
small melt pool to wash in just below the  pass.  All  during  this  time  I
heard yelling back and forth below me that  added  a  bit  of  drama  to  my
evening. I figured it was the two fellows still trying to connect  with  the
rest of their party. I have no idea what eventually transpired but  I  doubt
it was anything good as it  was getting dark fast and where they were  there
was no water and no place to camp.

Day Total: 10.5 miles, 4500 ft and 7:30 hrs

Day 2: Sunday, August 19 - Since I had already done  White  Mtn,  for  me  I
consider the true start of the Painted Traverse to  be  Red  Pass.  That  is
where I left the PCT to start a delightful ridge ramble. I felt like  I  was
in heaven. The meadows were alive with flowers of every color and the  views
were to die for  in  every  direction  but  always  dominated  by  beautiful
Glacier Pk on my right. First up was Portal Pk followed by Purple  Pk,  both
easy strolls. The descent off  Purple  offered  a  little  more  excitement.
Beckey suggests  "dropping  into  Red  Creek  to  avoid  W-side  cliffs  and
traversing to regain the ridge". I decided to  try  staying  on  the  ridge.
That went well until I came to a cliffy spot I didn\'t want  to  try  with  a
full pack. That forced me off the ridge to the left on steep vegetation  but
I found a way down by hanging onto scrubby  trees.   It  was  then  a  short
climb back to the ridge and easy terrain again to Skullcap Pk where I  spent
a glorious hour for lunch.

Now came the hard part - getting from Skullcap  to  Black.  Beckey  says  to
follow the ridge N over a 6360 ft saddle and descend to the basin on  the  S
side of Black at about 5750 ft. Exactly how to do  this  is  very  vague.  I
began by descending from the 6360 saddle but soon found myself  forced  down
to 5400 ft by cliffs and terrain before I could start traversing and when  I
did I ran into horrible brush. Maybe I  should  have  stayed  on  the  ridge
longer before starting the traverse or even gone over Pt 6844.  All  I  know
is the way I went was awful and not to be recommended. It took me  3.5  hrs
to force a way from Skullcap. Where I ended up was in a basin  at  6000  ft,
considerably above where Beckey says to be. But the good thing was  I  found
a dramatic place to camp right above a waterfall that put me in a good  spot
to climb Black via an easy gully. I took off at 5:00 and was on  the  summit
at 6:25. The last bit was an airy traverse along the rocky NW ridge.  I  was
back to my tent by 7:30 with more  daylight  for  dinner  than  my  previous
camp.

To Camp: 3.5 miles, 2200 ft and 8:30 hrs

RT to Black from camp: 1 mile, 1250 ft and 2:30 hrs

Day 3: Monday, August 20 - Next up was Magenta. From various viewpoints  the
previous day I had chosen a line that climbed onto the shoulder of  Pt  6824
at 6300 ft then traversed between 6000 and 6200 ft to get past Pt  6716.  It
was all very steep sidehill of heather and vegetation that was  so  slick  I
kept slipping. After about  a  half  dozen  slips  I  gave  up  and  put  on
crampons. That decreased the slip factor but increased the trip factor.  But
at least I had positive footholds. I just had to  proceed  very  slowly  and
carefully. I also kept running into hidden gullies. Just when I  thought  it
was all smooth hillside ahead I would run into another nasty gully.  Finally
I passed the last one and entered the gentle basin just  south  of  Magenta.
From there I climbed onto a rocky S rib to gain the easy  summit  slopes  of
Magenta which I summited at 1:00 (2  miles,  1300  ft,  4:20  hrs).  Magenta
isn\'t a particularly impressive looking peak but  is  a  splendid  viewpoint
and I spent a very enjoyable hour on top.

It was an easy descent to the Magenta-Red saddle and  more  easy  slopes  to
the top of Red Mtn though the last loose scree was a bit tedious. I  reached
that summit at 4:00 (3.5 miles, 2500 ft, 7:20 hr). I only stayed 20  minutes
as I was worried about the 5000 ft descent to the  North  Fork  SauK  TH.  I
knew there was a climbers trail branching off from the Lookout Trail  but  I
had never been up it and feared I would have trouble finding it on  the  way
down. I knew I HAD to find it or I would be in big trouble. The terrain  was
very steep and cliffy. I had no trouble on the first 1000 feet to  the  flat
above Ruby Lake as the terrain was open and all I had to do was stay on  the
obvious ridge. I picked up the trail here then lost it in the brush. I  soon
found myself too far to the right above a horrible  cliffy  ravine.  I  cast
around heading left until I ran across it again. This put me on the  correct
ridge just skiers left of the horrible ravine. I lost the trail again in  an
area of recent blowdown lower but  found  it  at  the  critical  point  just
before reaching the Lookout Trail. Thus is a critical  spot  because  it  is
very steep and cliffy and the correct line must be located.

Once on the Lookout Trail I  breathed  a  sigh  of  relief  and  thought  my
troubles were over. I was tired, my feet were killing me from all the  steep
sidehill and downhill and I was expecting easy trail. But no.  I  discovered
the trail had not been logged out and had a dozen or so blowdowns,  some  so
big I could barely muscle my way over them. Why  hadn\'t  the  horsemen  done
their thing on this trail? Once  past  the  blowdowns,  I  limped  down  the
remainder of the trail to a TH almost deserted compared to what it had  been
on Saturday.

Day Total: 7 mile, 2500 ft and 11:45 hrs

Trip Total: 22 miles and 10,450 ft in 3 days

Skalabats Pk (6697 ft - P537 - Glacier Pk West Quad) - August 24-26, 2012

It has been said that if  you  leave  something  behind  anyplace  you  wish
subconsciously to return to that place. Well, I guess I wanted to return  to
Magenta Mtn because on the last day of  my  Painted  Traverse  of  the  week
before I left my map case on that summit. I realized it too late to go  back
for it. I thought I would just write it off. No  big  deal  really.  Then  I
looked longingly at Skalabats Pk as I was descending Red  Mtn.  It  appeared
so inviting - an interesting yet not very difficult peak that looked  as  if
it would be a lot of fun and there was a  nice  place  to  camp  in  meadows
below the Red Skalabats saddle. I had really wanted to include  it  as  part
of the traverse but ran out of time. So I ended up  with  three  reasons  to
return - to climb Skalabats, to retrieve my map case  and  to  just  revisit
and enjoy again a lovely area. But I would have to do it soon, if it was  to
be this year, before my map case deteriorated in  the  elements  and  before
the meager snow patches I had seen below the saddle  melted  out  completely
and there would be no water available for camping.

Friday, August 24 - I headed up the now familiar  Red  Mtn  Trail  from  the
North Fork Sauk TH at 1:00. I only needed to get to a camp  below  the  Red-
Skalabats Saddle so was in no hurry. I even did about 1  hr  of  trail  work
sawing the smaller annoying blowdown branches  on  the  first  part  of  the
maintained LO Trail. At the end of this trail I found a  much  better  route
past the rock cliff by following a class  2  ledge  rather  than  the  awful
steep dirt gully on the right that I had come  down  previously.  Once  past
this spot I picked up the climbers trail which is a lot easier to follow  on
the way up than on the way down. The day was sunny but with  a  cool  breeze
and no bugs so the ascent, though steep, was quite pleasant. The  fact  that
my pack was 5 pounds lighter than on the traverse  also  helped.  I  reached
the flat at 5900 ft above Ruby Lake where the  obvious  way  trail  ends  at
5:50. I had hoped to make a direct traverse from here to  the  Red-Skalabats
saddle, but could see no good  line  through  the  woods,  brush  and  steep
terrain. I had to make the traverse about 400 feet higher and then  drop  to
below the saddle where I found a nice site for my bivy tent  at  6:40,  elev
6100 ft. A small meltwater creek was nearby.

Total: 3.5 miles, 4200 ft and 5:40 hrs

Saturday, August 25 - I started for Skalabats at 8:30 waiting  for  the  sun
to warm my campsite after a windy and chilly  (in  comparison  to  what  has
been) night. I quickly reached the 6200 ft saddle and dropped  150  ft  down
the other side on very steep heather to  the  snow  basin  below  the  north
slope. I traversed snow and talus to a broad gully which I climbed to  below
cliffs where a wide ledge led left to  gentle  slopes.  I  gained  the  main
ridge 200 feet below the top  and  the  summit  at  10:15  where  I  left  a
register (900 ft, 1:45 hrs). The east side of this ridge is all heather  and
flowers.  A most enjoyable climb.

I now wanted to find a way to Magenta  without  climbing  over  Red  Mtn.  I
descended to the large snow basin  at  5700  ft,  then  climbed  400  ft  to
traverse at about 6100 ft on the east slope of Red Mtn  to  the  Red-Magenta
saddle. This went quite smoothly although there were  several  minor  hidden
gullies to cross. I crossed a  larger  ravine  low  where  it  also  was  no
problem. Nowhere was the heather  steep  enough  on  this  trip  to  require
crampons. I reached the saddle at 12:50 and Magenta  summit  at  1:50  (2100
ft, 5:20 hrs) and sure enough there was my map case. I had for some  strange
reason stuck it on a rock ledge above where I sat to have   lunch  which  is
why I hadn\'t noticed it when I left.

With my first two goals of the trip achieved  I  could  concentrate  on  the
last - just enjoying my gorgeous surroundings. I wandered back down  to  the
beautiful Red-Magenta saddle where I found a small pond to  soak  in.  There
are a multitude of splendid sites here and I almost wished I had  come  this
far to camp. To return to my camp I took a higher line (6300-6400 ft)  below
Red Mtn meandering through meadows and  rock  garden.  This  too  went  well
except I hit the large ravine at a cliffy spot and had to climb  up  to  get
past it. I then crossed the Red-Skalabats ridge at  a  higher  saddle  (6400
ft) which avoided the considerable drop to the snow basin.  I  reached  camp
at 5:00. I still had time to go out this  day  but  really  didn\'t  want  to
leave so spent the rest of the afternoon and evening  relaxing  and  soaking
up the scenery.

Total: 4 miles, 2900 ft and 8:30 hrs

Sunday, August 26 - Again I slept in and didn\'t leave until 8:50.  From  the
summit of Skalabats I had had a good view of a direct route to the trail  at
the 5900 ft flat that would seem to work. And so it did, saving  the  excess
climbing of my in route. With this now being my 3rd time on it  I  was  able
to stay on the trail with no problem all the  way  to  the  LO  Trail.  Just
below the cliff, on the maintained trail, I ran into a  lone  hiker  with  a
heavy pack. He obviously was out for a few days. I thought  perhaps  he  was
doing the Painted Traverse from this direction but on  talking  with  him  I
discovered his goal was Ruby  Lake.  He  was  pleased  when  I  told  him  a
reasonable trail went all the  way.  He  had  never  been  there  before.  I
reached the car just before noon to  end  another  wonderful  trip.  And  to
think I probably wouldn\'t have done it had I  not  forgotten  my  map  case.
Things frequently work out for the best even they originally seem not to.

Day Total: 3.5 miles, 200 ft and 3 hrs

Trip Total: 11 miles and 7300 ft in 3 easy days

BTW Skalabats is a shortening  of  an  Indian  name  (Skahala-bats)  meaning
"Painted Mountain" that was originally applied to Red Mtn.

My main goal for this trip was the Top200 peak Mad Eagle.  Beckey  calls  it
class 3 but a photo I had seen taken from the  SW  by  John  Roper  under  a
beautiful early season coat of snow gave  me  some  trepidation.  From  this
aspect it looked quite difficult but also clearly showed how  the  peak  got
its name. Fortunately I would be climbing it from the opposite NE side.

Friday, September 7 - I drove into Canada and  along  the  Chilliwack  River
Road to the end of pavement at Chilliwack Lake Provincial  Park.  Past  here
the road  becomes  the  Gold  Standard  for  truly  awful  potholes.  It  is
impossible to drive the 5.6 miles to the Depot Creek turnoff with any  speed
at all and is even worse than I remember from my two previous trips  up  it.
In fact the beginning of the Depot Creek Road itself to  the  first  parking
area at .9 miles is almost an improvement. However, past that  point  it  is
strictly 4X4 territory. I managed to get to the end of  "drivable"  road  at
2.1 miles (elev 2500 ft) but even my Grand Cherokee had a hard time  of  it.
I began hiking from this point.  It  did  look  as  though  quads  had  been
farther on the old road almost to the US border.

This, of course, is the usual access route to  the  Chilliwack\'s  and  peaks
such as Custer, Rahm, Redoubt and Spickard. But  for  these  peaks  climbers
continue up the trail past the spectacular waterfall. I, on the other  hand,
left the trail before the falls, at about  3200  ft,  to  head  up  what  is
referred to as the Lake Fork. This was probably the most difficult  part  of
the trip as I was uncertain exactly where to go. In general  I  stayed  well
right of the actual Lake Fork Creek. I crossed Depot Cr easily on a log  and
immediately was immersed in awful brush, most of  which  was  devil\'s  club.
Fortunately the worst only lasted a  hundred  feet  or  so.  Beyond  that  I
worked my way up very steep hillside and  mossy  talus,  trending  right  to
avoid cliffs. I came out onto more gentle terrain at a broad saddle at  4500
ft where I dropped slightly into the Lake  Fork  Creek  to  follow  it  over
talus to a tiny muddy pond at 4800 ft. I had hoped to get to an  upper  lake
(which I call Goliah Lake) shown on the map but  with  the  long  drive  and
more difficult travel than expected I was running out of daylight. The  tiny
pond was not that appealing as the shores were very muddy but I did  find  a
useable grassy island just big enough (probably 5X10 ft) to set up  a  camp.
And the nearby inlet creek supplied a clean source of water.

Total: 5 miles, 2400 ft and 6:20 hrs

Saturday, September 8 - From my camp I headed for Goliah Lake  wandering  up
talus and around huge boulders. Travel here would be much better  with  snow
cover. I reached snow just below the lake in 40 minutes and stopped  to  put
on crampons. I now had to get through a cliff band circling the lake. I  saw
several possibilities and chose a middle snow gully as it seemed  the  least
scary. It did have a break at a small waterfall but luckily I  was  able  to
bypass it on rock to the right and regain the snow above. Easy snow  led  to
an upper small glacier between Mad Eagle and Goliah. Once on the  glacier  I
turned left to follow a steepening arm toward Mad Eagle. The upper part  had
a very steep wall so I worked my way even farther left onto slabs and  scree
until above the wall. I left ice axe  and  crampons  and  gained  the  loose
north ridge of Mad Eagle. I had to climb to the right of  a  small  pinnacle
before the summit rock came into view. My first view was not encouraging.  A
direct assault looked difficult but knowing it was supposed to be class 3  I
looked closer and saw a possible route to the right. I dropped  slightly  to
a narrow notch where a wide ledge led around the corner to  an  easy  gully.
The final summit rocks steepened again but by once  again  going  right  and
spiraling around it really was class 3 all the way  to  the  top  (3300  ft,
5:30 hrs).

Mad Eagle lives in the shadow of much higher Redoubt. In fact  it  is  often
difficult to pick it out from a distance. Still, it is a rewarding climb  in
its own right and views from the top are spectacular. It  shows  a  side  of
Redoubt seldom seen. The day was warm and sunny and I felt  no  great  hurry
at that time (1:30) so I found a  comfortable  spot  to  hang  out  for  the
better part of an hour. I even took off my boots. Perhaps I  shouldn\'t  have
stayed so long as I still had two peaks to climb and the  days  are  getting
noticeably shorter but I just couldn\'t resist.

I descended my up route to the small glacier then climbed  to  the  7120  ft
col SE of Goliah. A direct ascent  from  here  did  not  look  pleasant  but
Beckey said the W ridge was no problem so I headed for that. I  crossed  the
col to the SW slope and traversed what seemed endless talus and scree  until
I could gain the W ridge well past cliffs. The ridge itself was  a  pleasant
enjoyable scramble (4200 ft, 8:50 hrs).

It was now 5:00 and I could see I would be hard pressed get  up  Canuck  and
still make it to camp before dark. Wherever did the  time  go?  I  descended
the W ridge and then continued traversing toward Canuck, first past Pt  7487
then on to the 6920 col, again on endless talus. Once  to  the  col  it  was
quick to the summit of Canuck (4600 ft, 10:25 hrs). I left a register  here,
as I also had on Goliah and Mad Eagle.

From the 6920 ft col I descended a short awful loose dirt slope  to  a  nice
snow slope (but I still needed crampons) toward Goliah Lake some  1600  feet
below. When the snow ran out I encountered more talus and boulders,  then  a
snow band around the lake shore that was undercut  and  had  deep  unnerving
cracks that appeared as if they could calve off into the deep  lake  at  any
moment. And yet that seemed the lesser of two evils compared  to  the  steep
unstable talus above the snow. Darkness caught me at  the  far  end  of  the
lake and my pace slowed to a crawl as I picked  my  way  down  more  tedious
talus by headlamp. I was really getting tired of all this  talus.  I  pulled
into camp at 9:00.

Total: 5 miles, 4600 ft and 13 hrs.

Sunday, September 9 - I awoke to thick fog that kept me in  my  tent  longer
than I would have liked. It showed no signs of getting better  so  I  packed
up and left at 9:00. It carried just  enough  moisture  to  make  the  mossy
talus a bit slippery so I had to be extra careful.  I  was  so  thankful  my
summit day had been sunny. I hoped I might  find  a  better  way  down  that
avoided the devil\'s club. However, nearing Depot  Creek  I  again  ran  into
brush, though not quite as bad as the way up. I found a  lovely  spot  along
the creek to stop for lunch and to soak feet very sore from all that  talus.
I reached the car at 2:15 (5:15 hrs) where I had driving those  awful  roads
to look forward to.

Trip Total: 15 miles and 7000 ft in 3 days

September 28-30, 2012

Friday, September 28 - I began this day by walking up the gated road to  the
top of Slate Pk (.5 miles, 300 ft, :20 hrs RT). Views  would  ordinarily  be
great from the top but skies  hazy  from  forest  fires  detracted.  I  did,
however, get a good look at Haystack Mtn and Gold  Ridge.  After  this  side
trip and the long drive, I didn\'t get started on the  Buckskin  Ridge  Trail
until 1:00. I followed the trail up and over  Slate  Pass  leaving  it  just
before the junction with the Middle Fork Trail to climb  Haystack  Mtn  (900
ft, 1:20 hrs). My intent was then to drop back down to the  trail  and  hike
to Silver Lake to camp for the night. But once on Haystack the ridge  looked
so inviting with such pleasant travel that I was suckered  into  staying  on
it. Anyone who knows me  knows  I  love  ridges.  I  thought  I  might  even
possibly be able to follow it all the way to Pasayten Pk. And so I did.  The
first part was a delightful ramble with  views  in  every  direction.  There
were many ups and downs, over Pts 7121, 7456 and 7393. Much of the  way  had
a path. Then past Pt 7493 the  ridge  got  narrower,  more  rocky  and  more
convoluted. Nothing was difficult but it took time and  Pasayten  Pk  didn\'t
seem to be getting closer very fast. Just when I  thought  I  was  over  the
last bump, another hidden one would appear.  I was able  to  contour  around
one bump to below Pt 7588 but I had to climb over the later and drop to  the
saddle south of Pasayten. The final climb  to  the  summit  was  over  large
talus blocks,  not  difficult  and  actually  rather  fun,  but  again  time
consuming.

I reached the summit of Pasayten Pk at 7:00 and took a few precious  minutes
to place a register. The light was fading fast. I had come across  no  water
the entire day and was completely out. At this point I could no  longer  get
off the ridge to Silver Lake. My best bet was to descend the NW ridge  to  a
small lake (and sure water) I could see in the basin below  Gold  Ridge  (Pt
7605). I just hoped I could get down it as it looked quite  steep  in  spots
on the map. Sure enough, after about 400 feet I came to  a  rocky  step  and
had to drop to the left off the ridge down a class 3-4 gully. By now it  was
dark (the full moon was masked by clouds)  and  I  was  finding  my  way  by
headlamp down tricky terrain while carrying a full pack. I was not happy.  I
was forced down way below the ridge line and then had to climb  back  up  to
regain it. Then once on the ridge there was another small rocky  section  to
work down on the other side before  hitting  easy  meadows  leading  to  the
lake. The good news was there was a marvelous campsite there. The  bad  news
was it was 10:00 and I was beat. And it began to rain lightly  for  a  brief
period but by then I had my tent up.

 Total: 6 miles, 3000 ft and 9 hrs

Saturday, September 29 - What with my adventure the night before I slept  in
and didn\'t get going until after 9:00. My goal for the  day  was  to  ramble
Buckskin Ridge as far as possible. A short distance below camp,  by  another
smaller lake, I came across two people with 5 pack goats  getting  ready  to
leave. They were as shocked to see me as I was to see them. I  had  seen  no
one since leaving the TH and they were puzzled where I had come  from  until
I explained that I had descended from Pasayten  Pk.  They  were  a  charming
couple (Sharon and Perry)  that,  despite  not  being  climbers,  I  had  an
immediate rapport with. They were of my  generation,  had  been  hiking  and
backpacking since their youth and obviously  loved  what  they  were  doing.
They had taken to using pack goats as various body parts began  giving  them
trouble. We chatted for well over half an  hour.  They  were  headed  toward
Buckskin Lake. As I would be returning via that  trail  it  was  possible  I
would see them again. I was very impressed by the goats. They  seemed  quite
friendly and well behaved and could carry a fairly heavy pack.  I  may  have
to look into this option for the future. Goats seem so much simpler to  deal
with than horses.

I found a path leading to Silver Pass. From there  I  just  headed  up  semi
open slopes to Pt 7632 and then went along the easy ridge to  Pk  7815,  the
hi pt of Buckskin Ridge. The day was partly cloudy with  an  incessant  wind
that kept things quite cool. Views were a bit clearer than the  day  before.
From 7815 I continued easily  along  the  ridge,  again  enjoying  my  lofty
vantage point, until I came to Pt 7580. Here I ran into a  cliff.  The  only
way down was a nasty loose gully. It was unpleasant but it did  go.  Shortly
past that I came across the main trail which I  followed  until  it  dropped
off the saddle toward Buckskin Lake. I continued along the ridge,  bypassing
Pt 7521, to Pk 7606 (2600 ft. 6:40 hrs). I had hoped to get to  nominal  end
of the ridge at Buckskin Point but ran into impassible cliffs  so  ended  my
ramble here. It was now 4:30.

I returned to the trail at the saddle and followed it  down.  About  5:30  I
ran across Sharon and Perry camped in a flat basin  below  the  trail.  They
seemed genuinely happy to see me again as did the goats  but  I  could  only
chat about 15 minutes. I really thought I could still make it back  to  camp
before dark though I knew it would be close. Of course I  didn\'t.  I  hadn\'t
counted  on  the  frustrating  trail  which  proceeded  to  drop  more  than
necessary below Silver Pass and then climb steeply back up so  it  was  8:20
before I got to my tent. But hey, that was an  improvement  over  the  night
before. And this night was clear so I had the magic  of  the  full  moon  to
inspire me.

Total: 9 miles, 4400 ft and 11 hrs

Sunday, September 30 - Before breaking camp I zipped up Gold Ridge  Pk  7605
(1 mile,700 ft, 1:30 hr RT) then left at 11:00 picking  up  the  main  trail
below Silver Pass. Again this trail is very frustrating with  many  ups  and
downs. I did take the side trip to Silver Lake where I ran  into  the  first
people I had seen besides Sharon and Perry. I met two more people going  out
with day packs but that was it.

Total: 7.5 miles, 2000 ft and 5:20 hrs

Trip Total: 24 miles and 10,400 ft in 3 days

This was to be Jim\'s annual Golden Larch Trip. It didn\'t quite  live  up  to
that name as we saw few if any Golden Larches,  why  I  am  not  sure.  They
seemed to stop growing just south of where we were. But  the  good  weather,
lovely meadows, many little adventures and good company more  than  made  up
for this. There were nine total in  the  party:  Jim,  Eileen,  Steve,  Deb,
Kevin K, Maria, George, Karen and of course me.

Day 1: Thursday, October 4 - We drove in two cars to the Monument  78/83  TH
in Manning Park in Canada and started  on  the  trail  at  12:40  travelling
counterclockwise. We were greeted with the first obstacle of the  trip  with
a sign saying the Monument 78 trail was closed due  to  washouts.  Undaunted
we continued on. How bad could it be? Not that bad really. About a mile  was
washed out and hard to follow but most of the way was just an overgrown  and
neglected road. At a little over 7 miles  we  joined  the  PCT  and  shortly
beyond that came to Monument 78 and entered the US.  This  is  the  northern
terminus of the PCT and while there we encountered 3 through hikers  at  the
end of their long trek. It was fun to hear their stories.  We  continued  on
another 4 miles to camp at Castle Pass. There was  no  water  here  but  the
guys packed water from a creek (campsite here also) Â½ mile below  the  pass.
The temperature dipped to 22 degrees during the night.

Total: 11.5 miles, 2100 ft and 5:40 hrs

Day 2: Friday, October 5 - I started out about a  half  hour  ahead  of  the
group as I had hopes of climbing 3 peaks and knew I would  be  hard  pressed
for time. It was also much too cold to hang around waiting. In 1 hour I  was
at Frosty Pass (1.75 miles, 1100 ft). I left my big pack here, continuing  on
with a small day pack, following open meadows and easy ridge to  the  summit
of Mt Winthrop (2600 ft, 2:50). By the time I took 30  minutes  to  place  a
register and eat lunch the rest of the  group  had  joined  me.  They  would
relax for a while then return to  Frosty  Pass  and  climb  Blizzard  Pk.  I
continued on to the North Peak of Winthrop solo. I descended to  the  saddle
north and traversed around Pt 7496. I tried to follow the  ridge  past  that
but it was too rocky and had to  traverse  below  on  the  left.  The  final
summit block was a fun class 3 scramble to the top (3300 ft, 4:50 hrs).

For the return I really didn\'t want to climb back over Winthrop  so  took  a
traverse from slightly below the saddle. This  went  well  to  start  across
easy talus and meadow until I came to an extensive cliffy slab area. It  was
very interesting but I was forced to descend 400 feet on unpleasant  terrain
to get past it. I lost time here and didn\'t get back to  Frosty  Pass  until
4:30, much later than desired. I only took time to replenish water  from  my
pack before heading out again for Blizzard Pk.  Shortly  above  the  pass  I
passed the rest of the party coming down. They reported it an easy  scramble
with no problems. Easy it was but it also seemed long as by this time I  was
running out of steam. I reached the summit at 5:50. I stayed  no  more  than
10 minutes. The others had already placed one of my registers  so  I  didn\'t
have to take the time to build a cairn. I made it back to Frosty  Pass  just
as it got dark at 7:00. I took a few minutes to rearrange my big  pack  then
took off down the trail to find where the others had camped.  Originally  we
had thought to camp at Frosty Lake some 3.5 miles away. I was so happy  when
I ran into them a scant mile on. They had stopped at the first  water.  This
night was much warmer than the previous one.

Total: 10.5 miles, 5800 ft and 9:30 hrs

Day 3: Saturday, October 6 - The sun hit our camp early  and  warmed  things
for a very pleasant leisurely breakfast.   This  led  to  a  late  start  at
10:00, which suited me fine as I was tired. It was a good  thing  we  didn\'t
try to camp at Frosty Lake as we found no suitable spots  there  or  even  a
way trail to it. We also had  some  confusion  finding   the  trail  to  The
Parks. The junction is obscure and the trail  unmaintained.   Once  located,
though, it was easily followed and we reached the Parks in  time  for  lunch
(4.5 miles, 1600 ft, 3:45 hrs). The Parks is  a  high  meadow  plateau  that
reminds me of Grand Park in Mt Rainier. Jim, Kevin, Steve and I strolled  up
easy High Parks Pk at the far end of the Parks while everyone  else  enjoyed
the meadows. We then took the ridge SE to Pt 6525 before  plunging  straight
down  to  Frosty  Cr.  Travel  was  surprisingly  good.  The  only  slightly
difficult part was crossing Frosty Cr in  downed  trees  and  brush  to  the
trail on the other side. From there it was a short distance to a  nice  camp
near the trail junctions on Chuchuwanteen Cr.

Total: 9.5 miles, 2400 ft and 8 hrs

Day 4: Sunday, October 7 - Before  leaving  camp  we  checked  out  the  old
Chuchuwanteen Cabin. We found evidence of several  other  old  buildings  in
the area. Again we left at 10:00 taking the trail down Chuchuwanteen Cr.  It
was immediately apparent this trail has not been maintained  in  some  time.
But it wasn\'t too bad to the crossing of the creek, at least  in  comparison
to what we encountered on the other side. I would say the  trail  from  that
point on has been completely abandoned. It was difficult to  even  find  the
start of it and once  on  it  the  numerous  downed  trees  presented  major
obstacles. I think everyone came away with some injuries due to battle  with
the windfall. Our pace was so slow we fell far short of our  goal  of  lunch
at the Lookout. However, things did improve somewhat as we  got  higher.  We
passed Monument Spring but found the water undrinkable. We reached  Monument
83 and the twin historic Lookouts at 4:00 spending about an  hour  exploring
and climbing the tower. From the tower we entered Canada  again  and  had  a
welcome easy road/trail from then on. We polished off over  3  miles  in  an
hour and camped in the middle of the  trail  at  the  bridge  over  Monument
Creek, the first good water.

Total: 8.5 miles, 2500 ft and 8 hrs

Day 5: Monday, October 8 - We were on the go by 9:00 and did  the  remaining
easy 6 miles to the TH in 2 hours. I think everyone was anxious to  get  out
to real food and a warm shower.

Trip Total: 46 miles and 12,800 ft in 5 days

Indian Heaven is a small but charming Wilderness Area SW of  Mt  Adams.  The
PCT runs through the middle of it and a network  of  other  well  maintained
and well signed trails connects the many small lakes and  meadows  that  dot
the landscape.  My goal for this trip was the 4 peaks in the  northern  half
of the Wilderness. I  had  previously  climbed  Gifford  and  Berry  in  the
southern half. I expected to find  many  hunters,  as  I  had  the  previous
weekend in the Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness when I climbed Oregon  Butte,  but
in fact found none. And except for one very special encounter, I saw no  one
on the trails the entire 3 days.

Day1: Wednesday, October 17 - Starting from the Indian Heaven TH  in  Cultus
Cr Campground (completely deserted) I hiked Trail  33  to  a  nice  camp  at
Cultus Lake (2.5 miles, 1200 ft, 2:15 hrs).  After  setting  up  my  tent  I
immediately headed for Lemei Rock on Trail 34 leaving it after about 1  mile
at a red cinder slope below the NW ridge. This being a  P2000  peak  with  a
fair amount of traffic, there was an obvious path most of the way.  Once  on
the rocky north ridge the way wandered up and down  trying  to  avoid  dense
small trees. Interest was added with a fresh coating  of  snow  and  ice  on
both rock and trees. I reached the summit cairn (900 ft, 1:20 hrs)  in  time
to witness a spectacular sunset over Mt St Helens.  I  was  surprised  there
was no register. On the descent I could feel the  temperature  dropping.  By
the time I got back to my tent ice was forming on my  wet  pole  shafts.  It
dipped to 28 degrees that night.

Lemei Rock: 3 miles, 900 ft and 2:30 hrs RT from camp

Day 2: Thursday, October 18 - My wet  boots  froze  overnight  and  ice  had
formed in the open meadows but the sun soon warmed things up. I hiked  Trail
33 and 179 to Junction Lake and the PCT. From there I took Trail 48 a  short
distance until I saw a reasonable  way  up  the  forested  hillside  through
berry bushes to the small open summit of East Crater (3 miles, 800 ft,  2:10
hrs).

Back at Junction Lake I followed the  PCT  north.  Near  the  junction  with
Trail 33 I saw a person in bright orange that I first took for a hunter  but
which on closer inspection was not. She introduced herself as  Bonnie  Acker
Lamb. I hiked with her a mile, chatting the whole way, until she turned  off
on the Placid Lake Trail. She had lived all her life in Carson  on  a  farm.
She had all her wood in for the winter so decided  to  hike  one  last  time
this year to Acker Lake. Her maiden name was Acker and the  lake  was  named
for her family. They had camped on its shores ever since she  was  a  youth.
As a teenager she had manned the  LO  on  Observation  Pk.  She  had  worked
forest service crews wielding a chain saw. She had scattered  her  husband\'s
ashes on Grassy Knoll. Did I mention she was 82 years  old?  Did  I  mention
she moved like someone much younger and I had a hard time  keeping  up  with
her? What an interesting woman she was and I felt  privileged  to  have  met
her.

After leaving Bonnie I continued  on  the  PCT  to  the  junction  with  the
Sawtooth Mtn Trail 107 which I hiked to below the summit rocks.  I  found  a
way trail that led steeply to the base of the rocks where  I  encountered  a
short class 3 pitch that others had obviously been up. So I  went  that  way
and I found a geocache. Then I looked along  the  ridge  and  saw  a  higher
point. Darn! The geocache was not on the high point. So  I  went  back  down
and along the ridge to the true summit where I left  a  register  (9  miles,
2000 ft, 7 hrs). The climbing was interesting and  fun  class  3  -  4  that
looked harder than it turned out to be. The rock and holds were  so  good  I
had no need of a rope, which was a  good  thing  since  I  didn\'t  have  one
along. It never occurred to me I might need one.

I returned to the PCT and followed it back south until below Bird Mtn.  Semi
open slopes led to that easy summit (12 miles, 2900 ft, 9  hrs).  In  waning
light I continued on the ridge going south bypassing Pt 5518 until  I  could
descend meadowy terrain to intersect Trail 33 very near my camp. I did  make
it before needing my headlamp. The predicted rain  came  shortly  thereafter
and I had a wet and windy night - a very wet and windy night  -  but  I  was
snug and dry in my tent.

Day Total: 13 miles, 3000 ft and 10 hrs

Day 3: Friday, October 19 - By morning the heavy rain had let up and  I  was
able to pack up and hike out in just damp fog (2.5 miles, 100 ft, 1:15 hrs)

Trip Total: 21 miles and 5200 ft in 3 days

Before leaving the area for the drive home I drove  to  and  took  the  easy
trail up Sleeping Beauty (4907 - P347). This is an  old  lookout  site  with
the interesting trail blasted into the summit rocks.  It  is  well  worth  a
repeat visit on a good day. Unfortunately I had fog and wind and  no  views.
I also climbed Peak 5040+  (P1160)  on  the  connecting  ridge  to  the  NW.
Totally wooded with no views regardless of weather,  this peak is not  worth
a repeat visit.

Total for both: 4.5 miles, 2100 ft and 3:15 hrs

Trapper Creek is another small Wilderness Area  SW  of  Mt  Adams  and  near
Indian Heaven but unlike that one, which is dotted with lakes  and  meadows,
it is essentially entirely forested and has lower peaks.  It  makes  a  nice
destination in the  off  season  and  during  questionable  weather  and  is
accessible much of the year. The trails are well  maintained,  well  signed,
there are several nice places to camp and there are many  possibilities  for
loop trips.

Thursday, November1 - I had hoped to approach from the lower Trapper  Cr  TH
on the south, hike into the interior of the Wilderness and  climb  my  peaks
from a camp there but the weather changed those plans.  When  I  arrived  in
Carson it was raining steadily and the thought of hiking several  hours  and
setting up camp in  such  conditions  was  unappealing.  But  I  had  to  do
something after such a long drive, so I drove to the trailheads on the  west
side via FR Rd 54 to do short day trips. I began by hiking up  West  Crater,
just outside the Wilderness. I had a little trouble locating  the  trail  as
the sign marking the start is gone but once I did it is good all the way  to
the top (1.5 miles, 500 ft, 1 hr RT). I then drove to the Soda  Pks  TH.  By
now it was raining so hard I used an umbrella in an attempt to stay dry.  It
worked quite well on the trail and even on the cross country section to  the
summit, which had very little brush. I also went  up  the  lower  East  Peak
since they are called Soda Peaks, plural, and it was simple enough to do  so
(3.5 miles, 1250 ft, 2:30 hrs RT).

Once back to the car I drove on to the  higher  Observation  Pk  TH  on  the
north side. I considered car camping there and day hiking the next  day  but
by the time I got there it had stopped  raining.  So  I  was  suckered  into
backpacking even though it was after 5:00 before I got going and  I  knew  I
would get to my destination close  to  dark.   And  naturally  just  when  I
arrived at Berry Camp and started  putting  up  my  tent  it  began  raining
again. But once set up I was quite snug and  comfy  and  there  was  a  nice
spring for water a few hundred feet down the trail (1.8  miles,  600  ft,  1
hr).  It continued to rain hard during night until about 2 am.

Friday, November 2 - By morning it was no longer raining  but  it  was  very
foggy. That wasn\'t a real problem as I was in forest pretty much all day.  I
began on the main Observation Pk Trail, bypassing the spur to the summit  of
that peak, until it dropped off Howe Ridge at a saddle toward Trapper Cr.  I
stayed on the easy crest following it to the high point and on  to  Pt  3724
(just to make sure). Travel was pleasant with minimal brush and windfall  (3
miles, 625 ft, 2 hrs). For variety, on the  way  back  I  went  directly  up
steep slopes to the summit of Observation Pk. This is an old  lookout  site.
There would be a nice view on a clear day. All I got was  a  glimpse  of  Mt
Adams as the fog and clouds briefly parted - and I was lucky to get that.  I
picked up the spur trail on top  and  followed  it  back  to  camp  where  I
quickly packed up (5.5 miles, 2000 ft, 5:30 hrs). On the way out  I  dropped
my pack at the Sister Rocks Ridge where a side trail  led  to  that  summit.
The 4268 high point is actually a nondescript grassy knoll  but  the  summit
of more interest is the rocky 4261 point slightly farther on at trails  end.
It was now raining again and continued to do so the rest  of  trip  out  and
drive home (2.7 miles, 550 ft, 1:40 hrs).

Despite the rain and lack of views I did have fun on this mellow  trip.  The
forest was quite lovely. And I do enjoy camping in my little  tent  although
I must admit I really don\'t like putting it up (or taking it  down)  in  the
rain.

Day Total: 8.2 miles and 2550 ft

Trip Total: 15 miles and 5150 ft in 2 days

Thursday, November 9 - I began on the Big Creek (Irely Lake) Trail near  the
end of the North Fork Quinault Road. This is the start of the Skyline  trail
which I had done in its entirety in September of 1998. But that was so  long
ago I remembered little and it was like a new experience.   The  first  mile
to Lake Irely was very wet and marshy. I don\'t know if this was  because  of
recent torrential rains or if it is always so, but due to  the  many  bypass
paths and boardwalks I suspect it is the latter. Once past this section  the
trail traversed lovely forest with big trees and sword  ferns.  At  about  4
miles a high sturdy steel bridge crossed a branch  of  Big  Creek.  For  the
next 2 miles the trail climbed steadily until I came across a sign  pointing
to a record Alaska cedar. Past that things leveled out a bit but  the  trail
became increasingly rough and rocky and wet. Often it looked  like  a  small
stream bed. This became somewhat of a problem as I got higher  into  meadows
where temperatures had been cold enough to snow and freeze and turn much  of
the trail to ice. Although the day was sunny, by the time  I  got  to  Three
Lakes it was in the shade and downright frosty. I  found  a  bear  wire  and
toilet but only one campsite that was not flooded. The  entire  Three  Lakes
area is quite marshy and it is difficult to even  get  to  open  water.  The
temperature dropped to 22 degrees that night under clear skies.

7 miles, 3050 ft and 5 hrs

Friday, November 10 - The official Skyline Trail starts at  Three  Lakes.  I
understand that the Park Service is no longer  maintaining  this  trail  and
now considers it a "route",  but it is still in good shape as far as I  took
it to near Reflection Lake with only a few downed trees.  Here  I  left  the
trail to gain the ridge. I did not think I could  follow  the  ridge  to  my
peak as there were two rocky nasty looking points I would have  to  go  over
to get there. Instead I planned to drop into the  Elip  Creek  drainage  and
traverse a series of meadows below the ridge  on  the  north  side  until  I
could climb up again. It looked easy on the map. Looks can be deceiving.  It
was anything but easy. First the meadows were not really meadows  but  small
marshy areas in brushy forest. Second I ran  into  several  unexpected  deep
ravines that were difficult to cross. I had to climb back up 200 ft  to  get
across one of them. And third I was on the shady and snowy  north  side  and
had to contend with about 2 inches of fresh snow covering everything.

I eventually made it to where I could actually traverse and  miraculously  I
ran into a fairly decent elk trail. Without the  help  of  this  I  think  I
would have given up. This trail led to the flat basin NW of the peak. I  now
thought things would improve. They didn\'t. The terrain above the  basin  was
steeper  than  it  looked  on  the  map,  frozen  solid  and  covered   with
unconsolidated snow making for very slick conditions. I could  not  get  any
traction for my feet. I really needed crampons which I didn\'t  have.  I  was
making such slow progress that reaching my goal  was  becoming  doubtful.  I
almost made it to the summit ridge but couldn\'t quite get up  the  last  100
ft and had to back off. Before throwing  in  the  towel,  I  made  one  last
attempt by descending and traversing on easier terrain to  a  northern  spur
that bypassed the trouble spot. This worked and got me to the summit  ridge.
I worked my way up the ridge using a route that went from bush to bush so  I
had something to hang onto and reached the summit at 2:30, much  later  than
I had hoped (2400 ft, 6 hrs). There would have been a nice view but while  I
was struggling for hours the day that had started sunny had deteriorated  to
fog and light snow.

I did better route finding on the return but it was still  not  without  its
difficulties. I did much slipping and sliding down  steep  sections  hanging
onto brush. I was down to my last pair of dry gloves. It  was  so  cold  the
snow was not really wet but constant hanging onto snowy branches  eventually
soaked them. At least my feet were fairly warm and dry. I reached the  trail
at dusk and returned to camp by headlamp. My tent had about Â½ inch  snow  on
it. Again the temperature dropped to 22 degrees that night.

Total: 7 miles, 3050 ft and 10 hrs

Saturday, November 11 - Determined to have at least  some  views  I  climbed
the small peaks right above Three Lakes  during  the  morning  that  started
sunny. I found the old Finley Pk trail that led to the saddle below Pk  3960
and on to that summit. Alas it was so wooded  I  had  no  view  as  was  the
similar elevation west peak. So I returned to the saddle to climb  to  Three
Peaks BM 4008. There was no trail but the  going  was  reasonable  and  even
fun. But alas, once again by the time I got there  (noon)  the  weather  had
deteriorated to snow showers. I was destined to be denied any views  at  all
this trip. Then again it is the Olympics and it  is  November.  What  did  I
expect?

Peak side trip: 2.5 miles, 1450 ft and 4:15 hrs RT

Hike out: 7 miles, 300 ft and 4:30 hrs

Trip Total: 23.5 miles and 7800 ft in 3 days

Rinker Ridge (3760+ ft - P1360 - Finney Pk  Quad)  -  December  31,  2012  -
January 1, 2013

Despite  being  handicapped  by  another  painful  overuse  injury,  I   was
determined to keep up my tradition of the last two years of bringing in  the
New Year on a snow camping trip. A good forecast added incentive. But I  had
to keep the trip mellow and limit myself to an easy road  ski  with  minimal
elevation gain or suffer dire consequences.  I  first  tried  going  up  the
Cascade River Road to Rd 1550 but was stopped by an icy track  when  plowing
ended shortly after the Lookout Mtn TH. So I cast around for an  alternative
and settled on Rinker Ridge. I had no idea what I would run into  but  found
it to be a wonderful ski trip.

Monday, December 31 - I began just off the  Finney  Creek  Rd  on  the  road
leading up the north side of the mountain, elevation 900 ft. In addition  to
a gate there was a sign prohibiting vehicles so I knew  I  would  be  alone.
There was snow right from the start though it was  quite  crusty.  I  got  a
very late start at 3:00 but I wasn\'t planning on going  far.  As  it  was  I
skied up the gentle road until 4:30 to a nice  viewpoint  of  Mt  Baker  and
Sauk Mtn. I couldn\'t have asked for anything better given my parameters.

I set up my tent, had dinner, watched a video and  then  fell  sound  asleep
almost missing the New Year. I awoke at 11:30 and had to hustle  to  prepare
my celebratory hot drink in time for the festivities. I took  a  quick  peek
outside to take in the view by the light of a partial  moon  and  heard  the
local fireworks in the Skagit Valley below but preferred watching the  Space
Needle extravaganza on my  iPhone  from  the  warmth  of  my  sleeping  bag.
Reception was very good. All this excitement kept me awake for another  hour
and another video and I finally nodded off after 1:00. It was 25 degrees.

Day Total: 2 miles, 800 ft and 1:30 hrs

Tuesday, January 1 - The New Year dawned sunny but since I was on the  north
side of the mountain I didn\'t benefit from the  sun  until  both  it  and  I
climbed higher. The snow quickly got better, ranging  from  1  inch  of  new
snow over the crust down low to 8 inches of delicious powder near  the  top.
A series of roads and spurs crossed the hillside  and  the  many  clear-cuts
would allow opportunities for shortcuts with  the  proper  snow  conditions.
Given  my  limitations  I  stuck  to  roads  except  when  not  possible.  A
continuous road does goes all the way to top if you can find it and stay  on
it but it takes a long roundabout way up the west  side.  I  took  the  more
direct route up north side roads but then had a 300  ft  climb  through  the
forest to connect with  the  summit  road.  Once  on  that  the  skiing  was
delightful. I followed the road to its end just below the true  summit  then
wandered through the trees searching for the top (4  miles,  2300  ft,  3:50
hrs). A leisurely lunch was in the warm sun.

The run back to camp (1:10 hrs) was sheer heaven. I even  managed  a  couple
of turns in a high clear-cut connecting the  upper  and  lower  roads  on  a
slightly different route down. The run from camp to the  car  (44  minutes),
which I reached just as it was getting dark,  was  not  as  good,  the  snow
still being crusty and very fast. Fortunately that part of the road is  very
gentle so it was manageable with slow snowplowing.

Day     Total:     10      miles,      2300      ft      and      7      hrs
                          Trip Total: 12 miles and 3100 ft

Echo Ridge Ski Trails - February 12 - 14, 2013 - Cooper Ridge Quad

Echo Ridge is a charming and uncrowded Nordic ski area  above  Lake  Chelan.
All the trails have cute names and are  well  groomed  and  well  marked.  I
spent 3 days skiing the trails and even managed to  bag  4  new  summits.  I
stayed the 2 nights with friends who have a luxurious condo on Wapato  Point
in Manson. Sure beats car camping in a Sno-Park.   The  weather  was  mostly
sunny each day. Views are plentiful. There is still  enough  snow  cover  on
all the trails but some are thinning fast and many of the hillsides  in  the
sun are getting bare. New snow is needed.

Tuesday, February 12 - Russell\'s Butte (4324 ft - P404) - For my  first  day
I parked at the Zoom TH starting at 1:30. I skied  Zoom  to  North  Junction
where I picked up the Outback Trail skiing the loop  clockwise.  This  trail
is open to snowshoes,  dogs  and  boots  and  was  a  tad  lumpy  but  still
reasonable skiing. Supposedly there is a trail to the summit but  it  seemed
to end on the ridge to the south, the remainder  being  XC  on  crusty  thin
snow to the top and tricky on track skis. However, I found lovely  preserved
powder on the NW slope to descend back to Outback (good  enough  for  a  few
telemarks) and more powder on the north aspect of Outback.  By  the  time  I
reached Zoom it was in shade, freezing over and  found  out  why  it  is  so
named (8.2 miles, 1365 ft and 3:30 hrs).

Wednesday, February 13 - Wells Summit  (3825  ft  -  P308)  -  I  spent  the
morning skiing from  the  Upper  TH  to  easy  Wells  Summit  via  Nuthatch,
Chickadee, Ridge View, Morning Glory and Upsy-Daisy (3.5 miles, 450  ft  and
1:30 hrs).

I skied with my friends (who are not peakbaggers) from the Upper TH  in  the
afternoon to the very pleasant Alley-Oop  loop  (5.3  miles,  235  ft,  2:20
hrs).

Thursday, February 14 - Washington Butte (4390 ft - P180) and  Cooper  Ridge
(5521 ft - P261) - For my final day I wanted to get up Washington Butte.  To
this end I again started at the Upper TH and  took  No-Where  To  Hide  1.75
miles to North Junction. There I picked up  the  snowmobile  road.  Although
quite crusty in the morning, the first 3 miles or so were  very  gentle  and
it had been recently groomed so the skiing  was  excellent.  When  the  road
steepened just before Washington Butte I put on kicker  skins  that  fit  my
narrow track skis (50mm). I soon left the  snowmobile  road,  cut  up  to  a
higher ungroomed road that led to the saddle on the west  and  followed  the
ridge to the summit (5.75 miles, 1125 ft, 3:00 hrs). It was still early,  the
day so lovely and I was feeling so good that I wasn\'t ready to leave yet.  I
could see a reasonable route NW from the  saddle  and  decided  to  continue
along the connecting ridge to Cooper Ridge. The route turned  out  to  be  a
delight.  I was high above the valley (and  the  snowmobile  road)  on  open
slopes in full sunshine. Narrow track skis may have  their  limitations  for
backcountry skiing but they do traverse very well. I crossed the  snowmobile
road high and followed the main ridge to the summit  (8.5  miles,  2570  ft,
5:50 hr). I returned on the snowmobile road  which  was  now  in  shade  and
icing over. The upper part was very steep and  very  fast.  By  the  time  I
reached North junction it was  dark  and  the  last  bit  of  trail  was  by
headlamp. Needless to say I was the last car in the parking lot.

Day total: 16.2 miles, 2755 ft and 8:20 hrs               Fay Pullen

Mt Spokane Ski Trails - February 16-18, 2013

Mt Spokane, a P2000 peak, has long been on my to-do list but I  was  waiting
until I could ski up it. With my new interest this year  in  groomed  Nordic
areas, and Mt Spokane is one of the best in the state, I finally decided  to
make the long drive and get it done. I would fill out the  3  days  allotted
by skiing a combination of groomed trails and off trail easy summits  within
Mt Spokane State Park. No overnight camping is allowed in the  park  but  it
is open until 10 PM. Unfortunately, Bear Creek Resort  at  the  entrance  to
the park, where I had hoped to stay, was not open when I arrived on  Tuesday
(maybe because the downhill area is closed on Tuesdays) so I  had  to  drive
back  to  Spokane  to  find  a  motel  for  both  nights.  There  are   some
disadvantages to going out during midweek.

Tuesday, February 26 - Mt Spokane (5883 ft - P3503) & Bald Knob (5080+ ft  -
P0) - Mt Spokane Quad; and Mt Kit Carson (5282 ft - P322), Day Mtn (5057  ft
- P97) & Beauty Mtn (5200+ ft - P0) - Mt Kit Carson Quad  -  What  with  the
long drive I didn\'t get started until 2:00 but figured I  could  easily  get
up my main objective of Mt Spokane before dark  and  the  other  peaks  were
easy enough they could be finished in the dark. I parked at  the  snowmobile
SnoPark and skied the groomed snowmobile road to  flat  Bald  Knob.  Here  I
decided to head straight up the south side to the summit. There  is  a  road
to the top but it is 4 times  the  distance  of  a  direct  approach  and  I
figured I didn\'t have the time. It was just as well as  when  I  got  higher
onto the open slopes they were so wind packed, the wind so  fierce  and  the
fog so thick I could not have seen the road to stay on  it.  It  was  all  I
could do to follow a faint snowshoe track and ski area boundary  markers  to
the towers on the summit. I removed my skins in the shelter  of  a  building
wondering how on earth I was going to  ski  down  in  a  complete  whiteout.
Somehow I managed to descend by following the snowmobile tracks on the  west
side even though all I could see were my ski tips. But once into  the  trees
the skiing was fantastic in delicious fresh  powder.  Even  with  my  skinny
skis I could do reasonable telemarks.

I soon crossed the groomed snowmobile road and reached the cabin  on  Beauty
Mtn. I again crossed the road, since skiing XC was so delightful,  to  reach
the saddle with Mt Kit Carson. A snowmobile track led to  the  top.  It  was
fairly steep in places but I made it without putting on skins.  More  lovely
untracked downhill to the saddle  with  Day  Mtn  where  another  snowmobile
track led to that summit. It was now pitch dark.  I  was  feeling  cocky  so
forged my own route back to the road. I did run into a few tight  trees  but
the snow was so forgiving it was actually fun dodging them. I then stuck  to
the road all the way back to the car reaching it at 8:30.

Day total: 9 miles, 2450 ft and 6:30 hrs

Wednesday, February 27 - Tripp\'s Knob (3960+ ft - P80),  Shadow  Mtn  (4880+
ft - P120), Horse Mtn (5103 ft - P103) and Quartz Mtn (5160+ ft  -  P600)  -
Mt Spokane Quad - I made the most of my one  full  day  but  after  my  late
night and since I had to make the 40 minute drive from Spokane I didn\'t  get
started as early as I would have liked (10:00). Still, since I had  all  day
(and all night if necessary) I didn\'t feel rushed. This time I started  from
the Nordic SnoPark at the large Selkirk Lodge. The website said there  would
be no grooming Tuesday or Wednesday but to my surprise I  discovered  Linder
Ridge Trail (and a few others) was in  fact  freshly  groomed.   I  followed
this trail to Junction 6 and Upper Tripp\'s Loop which was  not  groomed  but
still nice skiing. Upper Tripp\'s goes downhill gradually for several  miles.
All major trail junctions are numbered and all trails well  signed.  At  the
Junction 11 intersection with  Lower  Tripp\'s  Loop  the  way  finally  went
uphill a short ways to the summit of Tripp\'s Knob (5.5 miles,  250  ft,  and
2:50 hrs).

I returned past Junction 11 to an  unmarked  road  not  part  of  the  trail
system which I followed to its end below the  ridge  leading  SW  to  Shadow
Mtn.  I climbed this ridge crossing Tamarama Trail and Mica Road  Trail  and
on to Shadow\'s summit all on very pleasant terrain. I dropped off Shadow  to
pick up the Shady Way Trail (ungroomed but tracked by  skiers)  until  below
Horse Mtn. I needed skins to get up this hill  but  it  was  through  lovely
forest. Then another short descent off  Horse  and  up  to  the  lookout  on
Quartz Mtn (8.5 miles, 2050 ft and 7:20 hrs).  I  had  enough  daylight  for
another fantastic powder forest descent off Quartz, again to the  Shady  Way
Trail below and then back to the car at 6:30 on  groomed  trails  Lodgepole,
Sam\'s Swoop and Mtn View.

Day Total: 11 miles, 2200 ft and 8:30 hrs.

Thursday, February 28 - Linder Ridge (4680+ ft - P80 - Mt Spokane Quad)  and
Round Top Mtn (4480+ ft - P280 -  Newman  Lk  Quad)  -  It  was  raining  in
Spokane when I awoke in the morning. I hoped that would  mean  snow  on  the
mountain. It didn\'t. I began in light drizzle. Since I  had  to  drive  home
today I didn\'t want to be out too long. I did  get  an  hour  earlier  start
than the day before. All the major trails were freshly groomed overnight.  I
began by taking Brian\'s Hill to  the  summit  of  Linder  Ridge  and  on  to
Junction 1, then Alpine to Junction 2 and Lodgepole to Junction  3  and  the
charming and spacious Nova Hut. I continued on Quartz Mtn Trail  leaving  it
at its lowest point to go XC to the  saddle  with  Round  Top  Mtn.  It  had
stopped drizzling but was now foggy  and  so  warm  that  all  the  gorgeous
powder of the previous two days was fast turning to mashed potatoes.  Still,
it remained skiable - just not as much fun. At the  saddle  I  picked  up  a
road with fresh snowmobile tracks (this is outside the  park)  that  led  to
the south side of Round Top and skiable slopes to  the  summit  (4.5  miles,
750 ft and 2:30 hrs). At the saddle on the way back I ran  across  a  summer
ORV trail that provided a nice route up to Quart Mtn Trail  again.  However,
I did have some problems with  sticky  snow  clumping  to  my  ski  bottoms.
Although no colder, it was precipitating again, but this time  in  the  form
of snow so skiing back to the car was again very nice.

Day Total: 9 miles, 1550 ft and 4:50 hrs.

Trip Total: 29 miles and 6200 ft in 3 days

Loup Loup Ski Trails - January 30 - February 1, 2013

I had always wanted to check out the ski trails at Loup Loup Pass but up  to
now the drive just seemed too long.  But  with  my  new  interest  in  track
skiing this seemed the year to give it a try.  And  there  were  a  few  new
peaks that could be skied up to  add  incentive.  There  are  two  areas  of
groomed trails. On is south of the pass at the South  Summit  Sno-Park.  The
other is north of the pass at the private Ski Area. No Sno-Park is  required
here but a daily trail fee is (a whopping $5 for  super  seniors  over  70).
The ski area is open Wednesday and Friday-Sunday and gated 1 mile  from  the
lodge when closed. The whole area is heavily wooded with  few  views,  hence
no photos. There had been no new snow for a while but temps  were  generally
cold so there was still powder in protected areas and either crust or  slush
where the sun hit depending upon time of day. The South Summit had a lot  of
debris in the tracks from windblown needles and branches almost making  them
unusable in places. The private trails were in better shape.  I  car  camped
at the South Summit Sno-Park.

I used Rossignol BC 65 metal edged skis with NNNBC bindings for  this  trip.
These skis are 65 mm at the tip and 50 mm at  the  waist  which  makes  them
wide enough for moderate off-trail but still narrow enough  to  fit  in  the
track. I custom cut a pair of full length skins to fit them as I  figured  I
would need them for South Ridge and Bear Mountain. You cannot buy 50mm  full
skins any more that I am aware of. But Black Diamond does  still  make  50mm
kicker skins. I use those for easier off-trail climbing.

Wednesday, January 30 - Pk 4658 (P618) - Buck Mtn Quad

I began at the South Summit Sno-Park skiing trails to as close  as  possible
to Pk 4658. Cross country travel on skis was not  great  but  I  managed  to
make it to the summit and back to the trail without major mishap. To  extend
the day I took a longer way on trails back to the car where I  met  a  local
skier just starting who liked to ski by headlamp. I  warned  him  about  the
debris. When I saw him again on his return he agreed it  was  a  bit  rough.
After that I had the Sno-Park to myself except for a mouse who nibbled  away
at something in my car all night long (6.2 miles, 985 ft and 3:30 hrs).

Thursday, January 31 - Pole Pick Mtn (4760+ ft - P760) - Thrapp Mtn Quad

I again started from the South Summit Sno-Park, first on the shared  use  Rd
41 then the K9 Trail to Trail 10. I then went downhill a bit to  a  junction
with an ungroomed road leading to Pole Pick Mtn. This road was  very  gentle
and took forever to get anywhere but XC travel did not look inviting to  cut
the long switchback so I stuck with it to the saddle SW of  the  summit.  At
least the last bit along the ridge was reasonable going. I did have sun  for
lunch but no real views through the trees. Once back to the  main  trails  I
kept to Rd 41 all the way back to the Sno  Park  (15.5  miles,  1730  ft,  9
hrs). Once again the mouse annoyed me all night long. (He stayed in the  car
all the way home where I caught him in a trap a few days later)

Friday, February 1 - Bear Mtn (5440 ft - P480) and South Ridge  (5634  ft  -
P1154) - Loup Loup Summit Quad

For these peaks I started from the Loup Loup Ski area on the north  side  of
the pass. I skied up Nexus to a sign  on  the  ridge  marking  the  Telemark
Trail to the summit of Bear Mtn (2.5 miles, 1450 ft, 2  hrs)  but  this  was
ungroomed and not great skiing. And it was a challenge skiing off the  north
end to pick up the Bear Mtn Loop Trail which I then followed  south  to  the
saddle with South Ridge. Here I skied an ungroomed road to  just  below  the
summit. I was delighted that this north aspect road  held  preserved  powder
that made for the best skiing of the whole trip -  until  I  left  the  road
that is. The final slope to the summit in dense forest  was  steep  and  icy
(6.5 miles, 2300 ft and 5 hrs). I skied  up  with  skins  but  gave  up  and
walked down most of it. Once back at the  saddle  I  returned  via  Nirvana,
Nexus and Outer Loop. (11.8 miles, 2400 ft and 7:15 hrs).

While hiking in the Indian Heaven Wilderness last October I was struck by  a
lone butte sticking up out of the vast forested area southwest of Mt  Adams.
Darned if I didn\'t discover it was named Lone Butte. On further  examination
of the map it appeared it would make a fine winter ski ascent  as  the  Lone
Butte SnoPark is located nearby. There were also several  other  summits  in
the vicinity that would keep me busy on a multiday trip and  make  the  long
drive more worthwhile. I didn\'t  expect  anything  particularly  outstanding
from any of these low peaks, just miles of road skiing  which  I  happen  to
enjoy. However, Lone Butte turned out to be much more interesting  than  its
mostly wooded appearance would suggest with the summit  ridge  being  almost
alpine in nature. Snow conditions on the trip varied from  powder  to  slush
to solid crust to gosh awful breakable crust as temperatures ranged from  23
degrees at night to mid forties during the day.

Thursday, March 7: Pk 3640 and Termination Point - From Carson I  drove  the
Wind River Road 30 about 20 miles to the junction with Road 31 and the  tiny
Lookout Mtn SnoPark, which was only a wide spot in the road with room for  a
couple of cars and 5 ft snow banks.  When  I  saw  the  road  had  not  been
recently plowed and there was 6-8 inches new snow I knew  I  would  have  my
work cut out for me as that meant no trails would  be  groomed  either.  The
snow was deep enough that I needed the low range on my Jeep to  get  through
and in places I dragged bottom. Again a disadvantage of going out midweek.

I started up Road 31 at 1:45. A sign proclaimed it  closed  to  snowmobiles.
It showed no recent non-motorized travel either.  It was a warm day and  the
snow was melting in the sun and skiing was quite good to start. I  took  the
turnoff spur to Pk 3640 at  0.75  mile  and  cut  the  big  switchback  through
pleasant woods making my way to the summit at 3:30 (2 miles,  900  ft,  1:45
hr). From there I elected to save time by taking a shortcut west to  hit  Rd
31 directly below. This steep heavily wooded slope  was  unskiable  but  was
great plunge stepping on foot and I quickly intersected the  road.   It  was
now getting late enough that  breakable  crust  was  beginning  to  form  in
shaded areas. That made skiing the open road  slow  and  undesirable  so  as
soon as possible I left it for a direct approach through  open  woods  where
the snow was still preserved powder. I hit a spur higher up and followed  it
to its end just north of the summit. I left skis here and booted to the  top
at 6:00 (4.5 miles, 1800 ft, 4:15 hrs).

I had a nice run back to Rd 31. What followed then was one of my worst  road
skis ever in recent memory. The temperature had plummeted and the  snow  had
turned to dreaded "death crust", crust soft enough to break through on  skis
but hard enough to form a thick surface layer that traps a ski  beneath  it.
On steep slopes it is deadly and totally unskiable.  Fortunately,  the  road
was very gentle. I ended up slowly walking out on skis breaking through  one
step at a time. I got very little glide. Things  improved  slightly  at  the
spur turnoff to Pk 3640 where I hit the track I had set  earlier  in  softer
conditions. But the whole trip out took much longer than it should  have.  I
reached the car at 8:00. I then drove on up the Road 30 another 6  miles  to
the huge Lone Butte snowmobile SnoPark where I spent the  night.  There  was
no one else there.

Day Total: 8 miles, 1800 ft and 6:15 hrs

Friday, March 8: Lone Butte  -  After  the  awful  snow  conditions  of  the
previous night I wasn\'t sure how the skiing would be to start but  it  ended
up not being all that bad.  From  the  SnoPark  the  main  snowmobile  route
continued on Road 30. It had not been recently groomed but much  of  it  was
in perpetual shade with preserved powder so in fact  the  skiing  was  still
very good even in the frigid morning. There were  the  odd  crusty  sections
but they were not a great problem going up. Turns out they would  not  be  a
problem going down either as after about an hour out  I  heard  a  motorized
noise coming toward me. Sure enough it was the groomer. I waved to  the  two
guys inside.  Evidently they started from the Atkisson SnoPark  (near  Trout
Lake) which connects to the Lone Butte SnoPark via some 30 miles of roads.

After 2.5 miles I came to the minor saddle east  of  Lone  Butte,  left  the
groomed road and skied up the east ridge. The beginning was  quite  nice  in
moderate open forest but soon steepened to  where  it  was  easier  to  kick
steps then ski. As I climbed the route  became  more  interesting  going  up
alongside an open gully, then semi-open slopes to a small  rock  outcropping
at the false summit. It all  had  an  unexpectedly  alpine  feel  to  it  in
contrast to the tree farm feel of the previous two summits. The  ridge  from
the false to true summit even had  fresh  mountain  goat  tracks,  though  I
never saw him. He also had made a bed right on the summit. I  had  lunch  in
the sun but unfortunately clouds were obscuring Mt Adams, though I  did  get
a nice view of St Helens. For the return I  dropped  down  the  steep  south
slope on foot to the spur road below and skied that to the now groomed  road
and then back to the SnoPark (6 miles, 1650 ft and 5 hrs).

Burnt Pk and Crazy Hills - It was too early (2:30) and too nice out to  quit
for the day, so after restocking food and drink I began again for  my  final
two peaks even though I knew I would return after dark and  run  into  lousy
skiing conditions again as things froze. This time I took Rd 32  north  from
the SnoPark. It was ungroomed but snowmobiles had  been  on  it  previously.
Oddly, a sign identified this as entering the Lone Butte Natural Area  where
motorized vehicles are prohibited. I guess snowmobiles  don\'t  count.  There
was a gate but it was buried under snow. The skiing was  good  in  the  warm
afternoon. After 2 miles I took a spur left, followed this to a  saddle  and
dropped down a gully to pick up the spur road to Burnt  Pk.  The  final  bit
through gentle forest with no real discernible landmarks was  confusing  and
I doubt I could have found the summit (at 5:15) without my GPS. I  did  more
ski wandering through forest to get to the spur road up Crazy Hills. I  left
my skis at the final saddle to kick steps up the final rise  to  the  summit
which I reached at 6:40. Back to my skis, I plunged south down steep  slopes
to a road that connected to the Burnt Pk spur and closed  the  loop  when  I
picked up my in tracks. I walked up the gully and cut a  switchback  to  get
to Rd 32 again. The final 2 miles out was not bad skiing  as  I  had  set  a
nice track and the road was very gentle but  it  was  slow.  I  reached  the
SnoPark at 9:10. It was too late and I was too tired  to  drive  home  so  I
spent another night in my car (9 miles, 1650 ft and 6:40 hrs).

Trip Total: 23 miles and 5100 ft in 2 days

These five peaks were all accessed from the large SnowKing SnoPark  on  USFS
Road 82 6 miles NE of  Trout  Lake.  This  is  a  combined  snowmobile/skier
SnoPark.  The  snowmobile  trails  are  ungroomed.  The  skier  trails   are
supposedly groomed but I saw no evidence of this while I was there.   I  had
about 6 inches of fresh snow on the approach road when  I  arrived  at  1:30
Thursday afternoon. It had not yet  been  plowed  but  was  early  the  next
morning. There were several snowmobile rigs and  skier  cars  parked.  There
are many back roads in the area that allow access to  gentle  terrain  ideal
for skinny skiing. Most snowmobiles that use this  SnoPark  make  a  beeline
for the vast open southern slopes of Mt Adams  and  leave  the  lower  roads
untouched. I was surprised by the dearth of snow in  the  SnoPark  (at  3200
ft) and on south facing slopes  nearby.  If  it  hadn\'t  been  for  the  new
snowfall some would have been almost bare. But  there  was  plenty  of  snow
once above 3800 ft. The ski  trails  at  nearby  lower  (2800  ft)  Pineside
SnoPark had so little snow skiing would have been very marginal.

Thursday, March 21: King Mtn and Smith Butte - I began from the  SnoPark  at
2:00 by skiing up Rd 82 to the first road on the  right.  This  was  a  very
minor road and I soon lost it but that didn\'t matter as a series  of  lovely
open glades allowed easy travel in the direction I wanted to go. It was  all
very pleasant skiing with delicious fresh powder underfoot. I worked my  way
to the base of the south ridge of King Mtn and up it  to  intersect  a  road
(coming from the east side and not shown on my map) leading to  a  tower  on
the summit (3.5 miles, 1600 ft, 3 hrs). I started in  sunshine  but  by  the
time I got to the top it turned foggy and I had  no  views.  That  seems  to
frequently be the story of my life.

I had a truly delightful run descending very friendly open  forest  directly
toward Smith Butte. This is my kind of terrain and my kind of skiing. I  was
in seventh heaven. All too soon I reached Rd 82, crossed it and had  to  put
on skins to climb the steep east side to the summit of the Butte  (6  miles,
2250 ft, 4:10 hrs).  No views and there were signs a squall was  approaching
fast. I had to descend the even steeper south side on foot as there was  not
enough snow cover to allow skiing through the dense brushy  forest.  At  the
base I hit a minor road which according to my map should have run  into  the
skier trail system. By now it was dark and snowing heavily and I  could  not
see very well with the light of my headlamp reflecting  off  the  flakes.  I
had some trouble following the somewhat brushy obscure road  and  it  didn\'t
seem to be going where I thought it should  so  I  was  very  happy  when  I
finally intersected a major trail with fresh ski tracks.  From there it  was
a very nice ski back to the SnoPark at 8:45. I was all alone.  It  snowed  a
couple of inches total overnight.

Day Total: 9 mile, 2250 ft and 6:45 hrs.

Friday, March 22: Snowplow Mtn,  Snipes  Mtn  and  Bunnell  Butte  -  I  was
awakened at 5:00 by the snowplow clearing the access road. I  went  back  to
sleep after it left, arising again at 7:00. At 8:00  the  snowmobiles  began
arriving and I had quiet no longer. I started at 8:50  up  Road  82.  Skiing
was good on the shoulder in untouched snow, not so good in the rutted  bumpy
snowmobile tracks. In 2.5 miles I came to  the  old  no  longer  in  service
Smith Butte SnoPark and a gorgeous  view  of  Mt  Adams  glistening  in  the
sunshine. Alas that would not last long. In another 2 miles  I  entered  the
Yakima  Reservation,  identified  by  a  large   sign   declaring   "permits
required." I was confused by  what  this  meant  but  since  the  snowmobile
tracks ignored it I did too. There was a large clear-cut here that  provided
my last good view of Adams. I took a rest of 5 minutes turning  my  back  on
the mountain and when I turned around again it was  completely  obscured  by
clouds and never saw it again the rest of the day. Good grief that  happened
fast! I continued on the road to the minor saddle  below  Snowplow  Mtn  and
skied up the short slope to the summit (7 miles, 1900  ft,  4:20  hrs).  One
look at the map and you can see how this peak was named  for  the  shape  of
its two wedge-shaped ridges.

I returned on Rd 82 until past Bird Creek and then began a long XC  traverse
to Snipes Mtn. This was quite interesting through varied but  easy  terrain,
much of it in a section of the vast Cascade Creek Fire of last fall.  Skiing
through  the  extensive  burned  trees  had  its  own  stark  beauty  and  I
thoroughly enjoyed it. The burn extended to the summit (10 miles,  2350  ft,
7 hrs). From Snipes I skied off the south side to another  major  snowmobile
road below, following this to skin up the north side of tiny Bunnell  Butte.
I am not sure why this bump is named when  other  similar  ones  nearby  are
not, but maybe it is because there is a large gravel pit on its  west  side.
I walked off the south side back to the snowmobile road and  skied  this  to
Road 82 again and its bumpy tracks to the SnoPark. It was past  7:00  and  I
was too tired to make the  long  drive  home  so  I  stayed  another  night.
However, I moved to the lower Pineside SnoPark to avoid  being  awakened  by
snowmobiles arriving early on a Saturday morning.

Day Total: 16 miles, 2600 ft, and 10:15 hrs

"Snowflea Hill" (3804 ft - P564) and "Nadwrap Ridge"  (3748  ft  -  P468)  -
Shuksan Arm Quad - March 30-31, 2013

I could not pass up going out on such a gorgeous weekend even though I  knew
skiing conditions would not be all that great. With that in mind I  chose  a
gentle road trip that would still allow  for  views  to  the  big  peaks  to
compensate.

Saturday, March 30 - I could not drive as far up Shannon Creek Road 1152  as
I had hoped, only 1.8 miles to 1500 ft elevation. I was not stopped by  snow
but by a large blowdown, the first of  many.  As  I  was  getting  ready  to
leave, 2 guys in a Jeep Wrangler appeared. They were  planning  to  camp  on
the  Sulphide  Glacier  on  Shuksan.  I  thought  this  rather   unrealistic
considering their late arrival (12:00) but then I guess  they  thought  they
would be able to drive to the TH since they had  both  a  beefy  4X4  and  a
chain saw. With the latter they proceeded to start in on the  logs.  I  left
them to play with their toys and wondered how long it  would  take  them  to
realize it was hopeless.

I myself had no such lofty ambitions  and  began  by  walking  up  the  road
carrying my skis. I had to work my way through  dozens  of  blowdowns.  This
road will not open until the Forest Service brings in a  large  work  party.
After about 1.5 miles I grew weary of crawling over and under  downed  trees
and cut the large switchback before Shannon Creek. I don\'t  think  I  gained
much other than a change of scenery. When I came out on the  upper  road  at
2300 ft the snow was consistent enough  to  ski  with  minimal  trees  down.
Where Spur 014 takes a switchback right to the Shannon Ridge TH I went  left
on the main Road 1152 (gated and blocked with  boulders).  I  was  in  heavy
forest with only brief tantalizing views of both Shuksan and Baker. On  such
a gorgeous weather day I really wanted a scenic campsite and so  kept  going
until I reached this goal, much farther than I had anticipated. I had to  go
Â½ mile up Rd 1155 to a small clearing at 2900 ft. However, it was worth  the
effort and was really a lovely spot with a lovely  view  of  Mt  Baker  (5.5
miles, 1650 ft, 4 hrs).

After setting up camp, at 5:30, I continued on road 1155 to a junction  with
1157. It was warm and sunny and the snow soft and good skiing. I decided  to
do Nadwrap Ridge first as the road ended about Â½ mile from  the  top  and  I
wanted daylight to find my way whereas Snowflea had a road all  the  way  to
the top. From the end of the road in a clear  cut  I  had  a  splendid  view
across Baker Lake to Blum and Hagan. However, there were too many trees  and
I was too low to get a good view of Shuksan. From the clear cut I  traversed
into forest and skied up to the saddle on the ridge. I left  skis  here  and
booted up the steep narrow but easy ridge to the forested top at  6:50  (1.5
miles, 900 ft, 1:20 hrs). No Views. Then on to  Snowflea.  Already  I  could
feel a crust forming in shady areas open to the sky. That did not bode  well
for my descent. The  road  wound  back  and  forth  up  the  north  side  of
Snowflea. At one point I caught a stunning glimpse of Shuksan in  Alpenglow.
Then in a clearcut just below the summit views opened  wide  to  Blum-Hagan-
Bacon but by now the sun had set. On reaching the actual top I  also  got  a
view in the other  direction  to  Baker.  I  kicked  myself  for  not  doing
Snowflea first when the sun was still up.  Still,  the  evening  views  were
very dramatic, much more so than the photos would indicate.  I  reached  the
summit of Snowflea at 8:10 (3.5 miles, 1500 ft, 2:40). As expected  the  ski
down was challenging in the forming crust. I was  glad  when  I  reached  my
camp at 9:20 (5 miles, 1500, 3:50 hrs).

Day Total: 10.5 miles, 3150 ft and 7:50 hrs.

Sunday, March 31 - I spent a warm and comfortable night and got  a  solid  8
hours of sleep. I did peek out my tent door for sunrise on Baker but  didn\'t
arise for real until the sun hit my tent about 8:30. I was in no  hurry  and
wanted to wait until the snow softened before leaving. Unfortunately it  was
still crusty when I was ready to go at 10:00 as I was on the shady  side  of
the hill. But I only had the short steeper distance to Road  1152  that  was
challenging before hitting softer conditions on the more gentle  lower  road
that remained good skiing the rest of the way  out.  At  the  junction  with
Spur 014 I ran into footprints postholing knee deep.  No  doubt  from  chain
saw guys. In addition to a late start they  didn\'t  have  snowshoes  either?
What were they thinking? I gave them little chance of getting anywhere.

I stuck with the road, not repeating my "shortcut"  of  the  way  up.  As  I
turned the switchback near Shannon Creek I  ran  into  two  dogs  and  their
interesting old timer owner from Sedro Woolley. I chatted a while with  him.
He too had no snowshoes and was struggling even following the  trail  broken
by chain saw guys and was surprised the snow level was so low. He  was  just
out to give his dogs some exercise who seemed to be having a blast.  Shortly
past that encounter I came to the end of the skiable snow and the  start  of
the cursed blowdowns. When I reached my car the Wrangler  was  gone.  I  saw
evidence of a new campfire in the middle of  the  road  so  it  was  obvious
chain saw guys camped by their car before leaving.  I had to  chuckle.  They
had cleared about 3 blowdowns to the first switchback, a distance  of  maybe
200 ft before calling it a day. I must admit though that  they  did  a  good
job on what they did do.

Day Total: 5.5 miles, 100 ft and 3:00 hrs

"Burton Mtn" (5456 ft - P416 - Packwood Quad) - April 9, 2013

I was stopped by snow on Road 20 south of  Hwy  12  near  Packwood  after  4
miles, elevation 2560 ft.  Snow was consistent enough shortly thereafter  to
ski although it couldn\'t have been much wetter without  turning  to  liquid.
It was warm with sun breaks to start then clouded over. In .3 mile I  turned
right onto spur 2010. The first mile of this spur  was  fairly  brushy  with
slushy new snow barely covering many holes over  the  brush.  Actually  skis
worked well (better than short  snowshoes)  by  bridging  these  holes,  but
wandering back and forth  around  obstacles  was  slow  going.  Things  were
beginning to improve with more snow cover when I came  to  a  deep  washout.
The old culvert was sitting  in  the  bottom  of  a  ten  foot  trench  with
vertical snow topping crumbly dirt walls. It took me a good  20  minutes  to
figure out how to get  across.  Shortly  after  that  I  came  to  a  second
washout. However, this one was not as bad with solid snow walls I  was  able
to side step down and up while crossing the water in-between on  skis.  This
is not particularly good for skis but I had beaters that I usually  use  for
spring conditions so didn\'t care. Once past all  these  obstacles  the  road
was clear and nice skiing.

After about 3 miles views began to open up.  First  across  Smith  Creek  to
rocky South Point. There is a nice trail up the north ridge  of  this  peak.
Then up to the SE slope of Smith Ridge. There is no  trail  but  this  is  a
nice ridge that culminates in a class 4 chimney route up Smith Point.  Then,
as I rounded the south  end  of  Smith  Ridge,  to  Castle  Butte  and  Twin
Sisters.  Again there are nice trails to near these peaks  though  they  are
accessed from a different road. All these peaks  have  fascinating  geology,
many  with  long  rocky  ridges.  The  granddaddy  of  them   all   is   the
appropriately named Stonewall Ridge (2 drainages away  and  not  visible  on
this trip) with its impressive 2 mile long  sheer  rock  wall  on  the  east
slope (I skied up this ridge from the easier side in wonderful fresh  powder
earlier this winter on an  "almost"  Stefan  trip  -  but  that  is  another
story). I mention all these peaks to emphasize that, despite  being  riddled
with logging roads, there is much of interest in this area  even  for  those
other than obsessive peak baggers.

After 5 miles I came to the end of the road at Dry Creek  Pass.  From  there
an easy route led up open forest to lovely Burton Meadows below  the  gentle
summit  ridge.  With  powder  snow   this   would   be   fantastic   skiing.
Unfortunately I had Cascade concrete. My consolation was it was so sticky  I
never had to use skins, even on the steeper sections. The summit  ridge  has
3 closed 5440 ft contours. The north one is surveyed at 5456 ft and  is  the
one listed as the summit by Howbert. Listsofjohn calls  the  south  one  the
summit at 5460 ft. Neither gives it a name. Just to be sure  I  visited  all
three. I would have anyway as it is a  lovely  ridge.  If  anyone  cares  my
altimeter indicated the middle one  was  highest.  I  have  also  taken  the
liberty of naming this ridge "Burton Mtn"  in  keeping  with  nearby  Burton
Meadows and Creek.

The trip down was fairly pleasant though not very  fast  in  the  "I  didn\'t
think it was possible to get any wetter" wet slush. Even the lower road  was
fun in a perverted  way,  dodging  branches  and  tree  limbs.  I  did  not,
however, like crossing the  washout  again.  But  as  my  organic  chemistry
teacher always used to tell me after I had messed up and had  to  repeat  an
experiment "it is always easier the second time".

Trip Total: 12.5 miles, 3300 ft and 9:20 hrs

Friday, April 26: Big Huckleberry Mtn and Grassy Knoll - I took  paved  Bear
Creek Road off Wind River Road which soon became dirt  FR  6808.  After  7.1
miles at Triangle Pass I turned left onto FR 68 2.1 miles  to  the  spacious
Grassy Knoll TH where I planned to car camp. No facilities. Both dirt  roads
were clear but had many deep potholes making for slow travel.

I started up the trail at 1:45. It was warm and sunny and shorts  the  order
of the day.  At a little over a mile I  came  to  a  rocky  outcrop  with  a
lovely view across Big Lava Bed to Little  Huckleberry  Mtn  and  Mt  Adams.
Oddly Little Huckleberry (4781  ft)  is  higher  than  Big  Huckleberry.  Go
figure. After a couple of more ups and downs along  the  ridge  I  made  the
final rise to Grassy Knoll, an old lookout site with a splendid view  of  Mt
Hood. I took a late lunch here in full sunshine (2.2 miles,  1100  ft,  1:15
hrs).

After lunch I continued on the trail along  the  ridge  to  Big  Huckleberry
Mtn. I gradually ran into more and more snow until  I  completely  lost  the
trail where it traversed the hillside below the ridgeline in  thick  forest.
I had to drop a couple hundred feet  to  a  saddle  then  work  past  cliffs
before making a direct approach to the summit from the SE. The trail  avoids
this area by circling around to the west ridge. The summit was  semi  wooded
which made the view from Grassy Knoll the better  of  the  two  (5.6  miles,
2120 ft, 3:45 hrs).

Finding my way back to open trail through the snowy  woods  was  facilitated
by GPS waypoints I had marked on the way in. Otherwise it  would  have  been
very confusing. Once on the trail again I enjoyed  the  evening  sun  on  Mt
Hood front and center most of the way and took  my  time  until  I  suddenly
realized I had forgotten to put my headlamp in my pack. Really  dumb  but  I
had packed in a hurried frenzy after  returning  from  a  weeklong  trip  to
Albuquerque the day before  and  was  totally  disorganized.  This  omission
added an urgency to my step and I made it back to  car  with  barely  enough
light to see my feet in the woods. I spent the night in the car.  I  met  no
one on the trail or on the back roads all day. Although this is a very  good
trail I don\'t think it gets all that much use.

Day Total: 11.2 miles, 3000 ft and 7 hrs

Saturday, April 27: Augspurger Mtn, Goat Point and Hauk Butte - There  is  a
nice trail up the south side of Augspurger Mtn from the Dog Mtn TH  off  Hwy
14 but this trail is long (14 miles RT) with many ups  and  downs  (4200  ft
elevation gain) and I didn\'t think I had the time to do it and  still  drive
home today. Since there is reported to be a TH on the  north  side  where  I
already was and since I love to explore I thought I would  see  if  I  could
find it.

I returned to Triangle Pass where I stayed on FR 68  going  east.  Since  on
the way the road went very close to Goat Point,  I  parked  at  the  closest
point and went XC to that summit.  It  was  actually  very  pleasant  travel
through lovely mossy forest but I was disappointed  there  was  no  view  on
top. I really thought a "point" would have a view (.7 miles, 450 ft and  :47
hrs RT).

About a half mile past where I parked for Goat Point I turned right onto  an
unmarked spur that my map showed going all the way to the  north  Augspurger
TH. It did but I couldn\'t drive it as it was blocked almost  immediately  by
a washout at a large creek. Darn. I was still a good 3 miles from the TH.  I
didn\'t expect to be able to drive on obscure back roads all the way  to  the
TH but I really thought I would get farther  than  this.  What  to  do  now?
There were probably other roads that went through but it would take time  to
find the correct ones and even then there were no guarantees they  would  be
drivable. 3 miles wasn\'t really that far if the road past  the  washout  was
easily walked and not decommissioned or overgrown. So I decided  to  go  for
it.

I had to wade the creek but once on the other side the road  was  very  good
and made for very pleasant walking. In fact some serious 4X4s  had  made  it
across the creek and driven on the road. But from the looks of it, this  and
other roads past various junctions seemed better than those  that  would  be
the exclusive domain of 4X4s. There  must  be  another  access.  However  it
could very well be gated. I met or saw no vehicles on  this  sunny  Saturday
and I did come across a No Trespassing  sign  posted  by  a  timber  company
although oddly it was facing the opposite direction and I only saw it on  my
walk back out.

After 3 miles of roads I came to a power line and gravel pit at the base  of
the cliffy north ridge of Augspurger Mtn.  I  was  getting  worried  as  the
terrain looked very difficult for XC travel and  I  didn\'t  know  where  the
trail started. As it turned out it was no great  problem.  I  just  followed
the highest spur to the gravel pit and it ran right into the TH.  There  was
an old sign at that point but no other prior indication of its existence  (3
miles, 920 ft, 1:30 hrs).

The trail, though obviously little used now, was really quite  good.  A  lot
of work had been done on it at one time to cross a  large  talus  field  and
steep wooded hillside as it switchbacked up onto the ridge crest  above  the
gravel pit and cliffs. Once on the ridge it was a  delight  as  it  wandered
along the rocky crest with views of Adams and St Helens  and  Hood.  It  was
somewhat brushy in places but nothing horrible.  It  was  also  very  windy.
Although  the  trail  to  it  was  interesting   the   summit   itself   was
disappointingly wooded with no views (5 miles, 2200 ft, 3 hrs). I  did  find
a place for lunch slightly downhill from the top  with  a  semi-view  of  Mt
Hood and out of the wind for lunch.

I had time on the way out to hike the side road up  Hauk  Butte  (10  miles,
3100 ft, 5:50 hr). I then took a shortcut straight down  to  the  main  road
that cut off a good 1.5 miles of walking. I was worried that  this  shortcut
would be brushy but it was surprising pleasant open forest. Once at the  car
I continued east on Rd 68 to Willard, shorter and faster than returning  the
way I had come.

Day Total: 12 miles, 3100 ft and 6:45 hrs

Accompanying me on this trip for  the  first  time  was  "Freddy".  I  found
Freddy abandoned in  a  parking  lot,  disheveled,  dirty  and  squashed.  I
cleaned him up and decided to bring him along.  He  would  always  be  ready
exactly when I was, go wherever  I  wanted  to  go,  move  at  my  pace,  be
indifferent to weather, never complain and always smile - in other words  be
the perfect climbing companion.

Thursday, May 2: Quinault Ridge 5 - I had been up  Petes  Creek  Trail  last
May when I climbed  Gibson  Pk  and  Colonel  Bob.  Conditions  were  almost
identical this year with lovely blooming oxalis and trillium  on  the  lower
trail and consistent snow once the trail broke into the open at  about  2500
ft. I passed up last year\'s campsite hoping to get a little  higher  to  the
junction with the Colonel Bob Trail coming from Lake Quinault.  When  I  got
to the junction (2800 ft) it was all snow but after a  bit  of  searching  I
found a bare spot nestled in the trees just large enough for  my  tiny  tent
(2.5 miles,1800 ft, 2:45 hrs). I set up camp and  immediately  set  off  for
Quinault Ridge 5.

Why the name Quinault Ridge 5? Quinault Ridge is the  major  divide  between
the Quinault and Humptulips Rivers. It has 5 peaks of prominence  along  its
length none of which are named individually. On  Howbert\'s  Master  List  he
numbers them 1 to 5 from south to north. Pk  4072  is  the  most  northerly,
hence it is number 5. When I started for this peak it was already 4:45,  but
I only had a little over a mile and 1200 ft to go to the  summit.  How  hard
could that be? Well, a lot harder than I thought. At first  I  was  able  to
find sections of the Colonel Bob Trail leading  to  the  3200  saddle  below
Quinault Ridge 5 but soon all  was  lost  under  snow.  From  the  saddle  I
followed the ridge. It soon became narrow and rocky and slow  going  finding
a way. I surmounted one particularly nasty steep step  to  where  the  ridge
flattened just before the final east notch and I  thought  I  had  it  made.
Then I saw I had to descend more nasty terrain down to the  notch.  At  this
point I could not get off the ridge to either side and had no other  choice,
other than retreat the way I had come, but to continue.

I made it to the notch and then traversed left on  easy  snow  below  cliffs
toward a second notch on the south ridge. Just before  this  notch  a  broad
snow gully led right to the summit area. While climbing this I  witnessed  a
slide come from forested cliffs above the notch and continue  down  a  lower
gully. It was small and I  was  well  out  of  the  way  but  it  was  still
unnerving as it came out of nowhere with no  warning  in  an  area  I  least
expected. At the top of the gully easy but slick, wet,  mossy  rock  led  to
what I thought was the summit at 7:45. There I saw a higher point about  100
ft away along a narrow exposed rocky crest. By the time I  made  my  way  to
that top it was 8:00 (1400 ft, 3:15 hrs) and by the time I left  a  register
and took a few photos it was 8:15. I was so pressed for  time  I  forgot  to
photograph Freddy but he was in my pack and this  did  count  as  his  first
summit.

For the return I took a chance and once back to near the  south  notch  kept
descending the gully on easy snow (the same  gully  the  slide  went  down).
When I thought I was below all the cliffs I began a  traverse  back  to  the
trail saddle. This actually went  very  well  and  would  be  the  route  of
choice. Too bad I didn\'t know about this on the way up. I intersected my  in
tracks and followed them back to camp by headlamp at  9:30  (2  miles,  1600
ft, 4:45 hrs).

Day Total: 4.5 miles, 3600 ft and 7:30 hrs

Friday, May 3: Mt O\'Neil and Wooded Pk - After my  late  night  I  was  late
getting up.  Had I known what I was in for I might never have  emerged  from
my cozy sleeping bag.  I started up the snow, which was  already  calf  deep
slush, toward Colonel Bob at 9:50. By noon I was at  the  saddle  below  the
LO. Here is where I began  the  route  to  O\'Neil.  The  Olympic  guide  was
typically vague saying to "bypass several rock  promontories  following  the
path of least difficulty" which really wasn\'t all that helpful. I  traversed
steep and sometimes icy snow in the trees on the south side  of  the  ridge,
gained the ridge too soon and had to drop off it again to make my way  to  a
notch before the last 4200 ft bump. I was not able to climb  over  this  nor
continue traversing on the south side but  luckily  a  not  too  steep  snow
gully descended to the north side where I could easily traverse to the  3840
saddle below the final rock dome of Mt O\'Neil.

Almost immediately above the  saddle  I  encountered  a  rock  step.  I  was
contemplating how to surmount this when I spied a rope hanging down  from  a
tree. It was old but sturdy and provided a way up a slab  to  a  ledge  that
led right to an ice choked chimney which I struggled  up  helped  by  branch
belays. Above this the terrain eased to enjoyable class 2 and I reached  the
summit at 2:30 (2 miles,  2250  ft  4:40  hr).  I  found  a   large  plastic
register that had lost its rubber seal and was filled with  water.  However,
the booklet was waterproof paper so it was still in  good  condition.  While
enjoying the views and having lunch I dried it out. It had  been  placed  on
8/30/94 and there had been 14 entries since. Seven  were  repeat  climbs  by
the same fellow, George Bauer. He must have really liked  this  peak.  I  am
thinking maybe he was the one who left the rope. The  last  entry,  and  the
only one I recognized, was by Kevin Koski and John Myers on 2/20/10.  I  was
the first since that. This peak is not climbed all that often.

After over an hour on  the  summit  I  decided  to  head  for  Wooded  Peak.
Although I thought it might be a challenge I was encouraged  by  the  person
who placed the O\'Neil register mentioning he was continuing on to Wooded  PK
to place another register. He must have  known  it  could  be  climbed  from
O\'Neil. Right? Besides with a name like Wooded how hard could it be? Will  I
never learn? Peaks are always farther, harder and take longer than I  think,
especially in the Olympics.

I returned to the saddle, rappelling the icy chimney and rock slab.  I  then
began a long convoluted downward traverse toward Wooded Peak. It began  well
but soon turned ugly. Wooded Peak was indeed wooded but hidden in the  woods
were numerous nasty cliffs. I was forced  down  away  from  the  ridge  that
connects with O\'Neil, where I wanted to be, by these cliffs. I could see  no
way onto it and had to  descend  several  hundred  feet.  I  then  hoped  to
contour around the nose of the ridge to the 3300 ft saddle with  Wooded  but
again was prevented from doing so by cliffs. Now I was forced to climb  back
up to ridge on steep hard snow. Once on the crest,  which  was  refreshingly
gentle where I hit it, I thought I had it made. But no! Following the  ridge
down, it again turned steep, narrow,  rocky  and,  to  make  matters  worse,
brushy. At one particularly bad spot I almost got out  the  rope  to  rappel
but instead found a log propped against the rock wall I could scoot down.

Eventually, I made it to the saddle and thought I had it made. But  no!  The
"saddle" was really a series of several deep rocky  notches  each  of  which
required care and time to negotiate. I could not follow the  ridge  but  had
to drop on the north side each time. Finally I was able to  gain  the  ridge
past all the cliffs and thought I had it made. But no! The ridge though  not
all that cliffy was littered with house  sized  mossy  boulders  that  again
took time and care to negotiate. I finally made the wooded  summit  at  7:20
(3.2 miles, 3300 ft, 9:25 hrs). I found no register or evidence  anyone  had
ever been there. I left one of mine (though I doubt anyone  will  ever  sign
it), snapped a photo of Freddy and headed down  to  what  was  now  sure  to
become an epic. To make matters worse I had discovered my headlamp,  despite
having the lock on, had somehow inadvertently been turned  on  in  my  pack.
How long it had been on I do not know but it  was  flashing  red  indicating
low batteries. So now I had the additional worry of my headlamp quitting  on
me. However do I manage to get myself into these situations?

There was no way I could return  the  way  I  came  given  the  time  so  my
strategy now was to descend  straight  down  the  forested  south  slope  of
Wooded Pk to hit the Colonel Bob Trail at  1900  ft  in  the  Zeigler  Creek
drainage. I would then have to climb back up to the 3200 foot  saddle  below
Quinault Ridge 5 where I had been  yesterday.  From  there  I  would  be  on
familiar territory back to camp. I tried not to  think  about  the  1300  ft
ascent to come. One step at a time. First get to the trail. Fortunately  the
line I chose down was not too bad. It was steep and I had to be careful  but
there were no cliffs, I was soon out of the snow and the forest was not  all
that brushy by Olympic standards. I stumbled onto the trail  at  9:00.  Step
one accomplished. (Note: Should anyone be crazy  enough  to  want  to  climb
Wooded Pk this would be the way to go, up and down.)

Next to get to the saddle. The trail was  good  enough  I  could  follow  it
without a headlamp for another 15 minutes to  the  crossing  of  Zeigler  Cr
where I filled up on much needed water. I continued up the  trail  using  my
headlamp on its lowest beam. This was easy going until I  hit  the  snowline
at about 2500. Then I lost the trail completely  in  horrible  terrain  with
700 feet still to go. I had trouble finding the right  line  up  this  steep
hillside without the use of a trail and with a wimpy light that  continually
got dimmer and  dimmer.  My  GPS  helped  but  I  still  kept  running  into
unexpected small cliffs and wandered up and down to find  a  route.  And  by
now my GPS batteries were also getting low. More to worry about.

I finally pulled over the ridge at 11:30 where I picked up my tracks of  the
day before, but I was so worn out by now it took another hour for this  last
step to camp. Both my headlamp and GPS had continued  to  work.  I  was  too
tired to make a real dinner. I just drank lots of liquids, quickly downed  a
Hammer recovery bar and crashed in my sleeping bag.  Freddy,  on  the  other
hand, was in great shape.

Day Total: 5.5 miles, 4900 ft and 13:40 hrs

Saturday, May 4 - I slept in till 9:00, ate breakfast, fell back asleep  and
finally left at noon. I actually felt better than I thought I had any  right
to on the way out. Maybe I  was  just  happy  to  simply  have  survived  my
adventure.

Day Total: 2.5 miles and 1:45 hrs

Trip Total: 12.5 miles and 8500 ft in 3 days

I had originally planned to climb Capitol  Pk  from  the  S  Fork  Skokomish
River trail up the north side, but that entails two bridgeless crossings  of
the river which I thought would be difficult with the  recent  warm  weather
and high snow melt.  So I changed to an approach from  the  Wynoochee  River
and Copper Creek Pass. This  route  first  climbs  over  Pk  4949  and  then
follows the connecting ridge to the south side of  Capitol  Peak.  I  wasn\'t
sure how this would go as the ridge looked steep and rocky on  the  map  but
at least I wouldn\'t have to contend with fast water.

Wednesday, May 8: Pk 4375 - I drove the long road  up  the  Wynoochee  River
valley past Wynoochee Lake (a total of 42.2 miles from Hwy 12) to  spur  300
where Rd 2270 goes left to cross the river. This  spur  only  goes  .4  mile
farther before being blocked at 1900 ft. Parking is very tight  at  the  end
and turning around a challenge.  The abandoned road has turned into  a  very
pleasant trail for hiking. It gets some traffic as it is also  the  approach
for Wynoochee Pt, the Grays Harbor  CoHP.  At  about  2800  ft  I  ran  into
consistent snow. At 3500 I  came  to  Copper  Creek  Pass  and  my  intended
campsite. I was lucky to find a flat bare spot melted out  on  the  edge  of
the road to pitch my tent (2.5 miles, 1700 ft, 2:25 hrs).

After setting up camp I headed for Pk 4375, continuing  north  on  the  road
from the pass until below the peak. I avoided cliffs by climbing steep  snow
to the SW ridge which I then followed to the small rocky summit. I was  back
in camp well before dark (3 miles, 1000 ft, 4 hrs RT). This ended  up  being
an interesting but not too difficult bonus peak that had the  added  benefit
of providing a nice view of Capitol Pk and the first part of  the  route  to
Pk 4949.

Day Total: 5.5 miles, 2700 ft and 6:25 hrs

Thursday, May 9: Capitol Pk and Pk 4949 - With the  insight  I  gained  from
the Pk 4375 view I climbed left from Copper Creek Pass to a snow gully  that
avoided the initial steep cliffy area. At  the  top  of  the  gully  I  then
traversed right in forest under more cliffs until  reaching  easier  terrain
that led straight up to open snow slopes below Wynoochee Pt. Although  I  am
not really into county high points, since I was so close I took  the  slight
detour to that high point before climbing Pk 4949 (1450 ft, 2:20 hrs).

From Pk 4949 the route looked nasty. I wasn\'t even sure where the  ridge  to
Capitol started or how to get onto it as the first part was rather  obscure,
steep and brushy. But once on the ridge it wasn\'t really  all  that  bad  if
you went the right way. However there were many ups and  downs  and  it  was
slow going. Except for dropping on the north side to a low point of 4500  ft
to get past a pinnacle, I found it best to stay right  on  the  crest  until
coming to Pt 4840. This I then passed high on the south side  only  to  drop
again to the saddle with the main peak. A traverse under  cliffs  led  to  a
snow gully on the right that ended on the SE ridge. The final  summit  ridge
looked very intimidating but did lay back as I got closer,  except  for  the
last 40 feet. I struggled up the initial slab via a crack  on  the  left  to
where it eased at a ledge, went up and through a notch and on to the  summit
(2300 ft, 5 hrs).

I found a summit register in a large container but the booklet  was  such  a
sodden mess it was totally useless. I was really disappointed  as  I  wanted
to see when this peak was last climbed. I don\'t  think  it  is  very  often.
Will those who place registers ever  learn  that  you  MUST  USE  WATERPROOF
PAPER? All homemade registers seem to leak and  regular  paper  never  lasts
long. I placed my new smaller register inside the old  larger  one.  (As  an
interesting  sidebar,  although  I  am  not  sure  why,  the  register  also
contained a dollar bill that was in good condition. Our currency is  printed
on quality paper.)  I also found a benchmark  with  the  identification  "Mt
Church". Has the name changed since the benchmark was  placed  in  1949?  Mt
Church is actually the peak 1.5 miles to the  south  (another  good  climb).
Oddly the benchmark is also named Mt Church right next to the peak  name  of
Capitol Pk on the 7.5 minute USGS Mt Tebo Quad.

After an hour on top enjoying the views and drying my socks in  the  sun,  I
left at 2:30.  I  rappelled  the  rock  pitch  using  a  sling  on  a  horn,
downclimbed to the top of the gully and did two more rappels off trees  down
the top section. I could have downclimbed it but it was quite steep and  the
snow was soft with steps breaking out. I tend to be very careful  when  solo
climbing as I cannot afford to make any mistakes. I then  just  followed  my
footsteps back. It was easier as now I knew exactly where to go but  it  was
still slow going and much of it was up. It took just as long to get back  to
Pk 4949 as it had taken coming. Then it was all downhill  to  camp  which  I
reached at the refreshingly early hour of 6:15. I still had time to  go  out
but I had a nice camp, it was a beautiful day, I  was  in  no  hurry  and  I
really didn\'t want to drive home in the dark.  So  I  stayed  another  night
relaxing and enjoying the views and sounds  of  nature.  I  also  watched  a
video of one my favorite series, "I Shouldn\'t Be  Alive."  I  like  watching
that because I can relate to many of the episodes and could even  contribute
a few of my own.

Day Total: 3 miles, 3000 ft and 8:00 hrs

Friday, May 10 - All I had to do was hike out which I  did  in  short  order
reaching the car at 9:15.

 Day Total: 2.5 miles and 1:15 hrs

Lena Lake Peaks: Pk 4110 (P550) and Pk 4325 (P405) - Mt  Washington  Quad  -
May 15-17, 2013

I climbed these two peaks from a camp at Lena Lake. Lena Lake has to be  one
of the most heavily used backpacking  areas  in  the  state  and  is  to  be
avoided during high season. But I was there in the middle of  the  week  and
during a period of iffy weather so pretty much  had  the  place  to  myself.
Although the forecast was for rain, I was lucky and had very little  on  the
climbs themselves, just drizzle for Pk 4110 and partial  sun  for  Pk  4325.
It did rain steadily my second night.

PK 4110 - After hiking to Lena Lake and setting up camp, I continued on  the
trail to The Brothers a very short distance to where I could cross the  East
Fork of Lena Creek. Then I just went straight uphill. The terrain  was  much
more open than expected, first mossy boulders  then  steep  dirt.  At  about
3200 feet I hit a cliff, went right onto a  brushy  rib,  followed  the  rib
along the top of the cliff band and then worked my way up  slabs.  Near  the
summit I hit more cliffs which I traversed below on a wide bench left  until
I could easily climb to the wooded summit. It was foggy but  I  doubt  there
would have been views in any event. I left a small register.

2.5 miles, 2500 ft and 5 hrs RT from camp

Pk 4325 - The next day I started up the trail  to  Upper  Lena  Lake.  There
were many blow downs that slowed progress. After about 1.7 miles, where  the
trail crosses Lena Cr, I headed straight uphill. It began badly, very  steep
and brushy. I literally took it 10 feet at a time. I could not see  where  I
was going and nothing looked good. At least  there  were  no  cliffs.  After
about 800 ft of wishing I were somewhere else but doggedly  continuing,  the
terrain changed to open forest and things improved  greatly.  Then  I  began
running into snow which made it even better. I  hit  the  ridge  NE  of  the
summit and easily followed it to the semi open summit where  I  had  limited
views of Bretherton, Lena and East Lena. Again I left a  small  register.  I
did not want to return the way I  came  so  instead  I  headed  SE  straight
downhill, going past a small still frozen tarn, to hit the  main  Lena  Lake
trail. This worked better than anticipated, being mostly open forest,  until
the last 500 feet. Then it turned positively ugly  -  brushy  and  extremely
steep.

 4 miles, 2550 ft and 8 hrs RT from camp.

Because I wanted to climb both peaks from a camp at Lena Lake I am not  sure
I my routes were the best ones. None the less they got me  up.  I  found  no
evidence that anyone had previously climbed either one.

Trip Total: 13 miles and 6800 ft in 3 days

Chelan Lakeshore Trail: Moore Point to Prince Creek - May 26-27, 2013

A change of pace backpack with my son  Walter  and  daughter-in-law  Jessica
that we did after first spending two nights at our cabin in Douglas  County.
It ended up being a delightful trip. We did a shorter version  and  went  in
the opposite direction than is usual, starting at Moore Point and ending  at
Prince Creek. Most people start at Prince Creek and  go  to  Stehekin.   But
this worked very well for a holiday weekend as it resulted in  running  into
much fewer people. The weather was constantly threatening  and  unseasonably
cool but we had no serious  rain.  The  high  peaks  stayed  mostly  in  the
clouds.

On Sunday we took the boat to  Moore  Point.  On  this  middle  day  of  the
holiday weekend  the  boat  was  surprisingly  empty.  However  Moore  Point
campground was very crowded and 30 Boy Scouts  were  waiting  to  board  for
Stehekin. Once on the trail things thinned rapidly. We saw maybe  3  parties
this first day all going the other way. The section of the  Lakeshore  Trail
we hiked does not really follow the  shore  and  is  not  really  level  but
immediately climbs 3-400 feet above the Lake and for  the  most  part  stays
there with many small ups and downs until near  Prince  Creek.  Much  of  it
traverses through the 2001 Rex Creek Fire. This is not  all  bad  as  it  is
regenerating nicely and the thinned trees allow  for  better  views  of  the
lake. We camped at Cascade Creek Camp  which  is  right  on  the  shore  and
requires dropping over 300 feet on a side trail to access  it.  We  had  the
entire camp to ourselves. Who would have thought this possible on a  holiday
weekend along a popular trail!

On Monday we continued to Prince Creek.  I  found  this  section  particular
scenic. The trail alternated between open rocky benches, grassy meadows  and
weaving in and out of lush gullies.  The  terrain  was  quite  varied,  more
vegetated and wetter than  I  expected,  and  always  in  constant  view  of
beautiful Lake Chelan. After crossing Rex Creek short switchbacks  descended
all the way to lake level to avoid a sheer cliff, immediately  climbed  back
up again, and then began a gradual final descent to Prince Creek. Near  here
we ran into a couple who had started at Prince Creek  two  days  before  and
were now returning. They were the only people we encountered going the  same
direction as we were. It was fortunate we ran into them as they  knew  where
the boat would land on the shore. It  was  not  obvious  to  us  as  it  was
several hundred feet away from the dock. The campground  was  deserted.  The
boat was 40 minutes late picking us up and jam packed, not surprising  given
the departing crowds up lake. But since the weather had  taken  a  turn  for
the bad with wind driven drizzle as we waited, we were just  happy  to  make
it to the protection of the boat.

Trip Total: 11.4 miles and 2600 ft in 2 days (5.2 miles & 1100  ft  -  Moore
Pt to Cascade Creek Camp; 6.2 miles and 1500 ft  -  Cascade  Creek  Camp  to
Prince Cr)

- May 31 - June 2, 2013

I made my first trip to the  beautiful  Wenaha-Tucannon  Wilderness  of  the
Blue Mountains in extreme SE Washington last October to climb Oregon  Butte.
That was a few days before hunting season started  and  already  the  Teepee
parking lot was full with horse parties getting a head start to claim  their
campsites. This is a very popular place with hunters and I do not  recommend
visiting then. But June, when meadow  wildflowers  are  at  their  peak,  is
another matter. I also timed it so the  higher  (5850  ft)  Diamond  TH  was
still closed due to snow which assured solitude near Diamond Pk.

Friday, May 31 - I started from the lower (3200 ft) Panjab TH just  after  a
party of 4 from Spokane. They asked me to  take  their  picture.  They  were
only going to Indian Corral and coming out the next day.  The  Panjab  Trail
follows lush Panjab Creek for 5 miles before breaking out of the  forest  at
the Mt Misery Trail junction. A  short  ways  on  I  passed  the  Spokane  4
setting up camp. After that I saw no one the rest of the trip.

Why this trail is named Misery I have no idea. It is anything  but.  It  has
to be one of the premiere ridge routes in the state.  I  was  totally  blown
away  by  the  miles  of  gorgeous  open  meadows  filled  with  carpets  of
wildflowers. Never have  I  seen  such  extensive  meadows  for  so  long  a
distance. Meadows were everywhere I looked in every  direction.  The  entire
distance from Indian Corral to Mt Misery stays above 5600 ft but  since  the
trail is mostly on the south side of the ridge the snow was almost  entirely
melted except for forested sections. I was surprised by how  wet  the  tread
was. Seeps were plentiful and fed floral displays. I am sure these  all  dry
up by summer but springs are also common along the way and are  said  to  be
reliable. I made it to one of these, Clover Spring, which had cleverly  been
rigged to provide a hose of  flowing  water.  I  found  a  perfect  campsite
nearby in the trees.

Day Total: 7.6 miles, 3000 ft and 5:45 hrs

Saturday, June 1 - I continued on along the trail from Clover  Spring  at  a
leisurely pace enjoying every step. This section had  more  wooded  sections
and I ran into more snow then the previous day, but I also had better  views
south into the heart of Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness and beyond to  Oregon.  I
passed Bear Wallow, Squaw, Sheephead and  Diamond  Springs,  all  with  nice
camps. But Squaw was mostly snowed in, Diamond  completely  snowed  in,  and
the springs for the other two a ways downhill off the trail.  After  passing
the junction to Diamond Peak, I soon came to the road at the Diamond TH.  Mt
Misery is not actually in the wilderness but  I  was  under  the  impression
there was still a trail up it. If so I never found it. I ended up  following
the road to  where  I  could  climb  up  the  west  ridge.  I  was  somewhat
disappointed with this turn of events. How could the Mt Misery Trail not  go
to Mt Misery? Perhaps it did so at one time.

On the return I took the side trail, mostly under snow, up Diamond  Peak.  I
found a register declaring this the Garfield County High Point at  6379  ft.
This is at odds with Lists of John which  calls  the  rounded  bump  to  the
west, at 6380 one foot higher, the CoHP because it uses  average  elevations
and not clean elevations as its base. My feeling is Diamond  Pk  is  higher.
Whatever, I climbed them both since I am compelled to climb  every  and  all
bumps anyway. So I guess I ticked off another CoHP unintentionally.

 Views from the summit were nice as long as you looked away from  the  radio
tower on top. Diamond Peak is in the wilderness. Let me see if I  understand
this correctly. You can\'t leave rappel slings or bolts in a  wilderness  but
a  radio  tower  is  okay?  Seem  contradictory  to  me  but  maybe  it  was
grandfathered in.

Near camp I ran into a fresh bear track in the snow  that  wasn\'t  there  in
the morning. Sobering but I had hung my food high. I also  saw  7  deer  and
many tracks of elk. Wildlife is plentiful.

Day Total: 14.6 miles, 3000 ft and 10:45 hrs

Sunday, June 2 - I was intrigued by Elk Flat that I saw on the map  near  my
camp, and before heading out I had to go for a visit. Evidently  others  had
the same idea as a faint trail led from Clover Spring to  it.  It  surpassed
my expectations and even in an area of spectacular meadows Elk  Flat  stands
out. I came across the thickest carpet of grass  widow  wildflowers  I  have
ever seen. It was well worth the side trip.

Side trip to Elk Flat: 2.8 miles, 350 ft and 1:30 hrs RT from camp.

On the trip out I stayed on  the  Mt  Misery  Trail  1.2  miles  beyond  the
junction with the Panjab Trail so I could  climb  Al  Williams  Ridge.   The
ridge itself was rather anti-climatic compared to what had gone  before  but
it did allow me to prolong being in meadows for a while longer and  to  vary
the return route.  All morning I watched thunderheads  build.  They  reached
their climax while I was on the summit and I had to  hurry  off  the  ridge.
Naturally the rain hit with the  worst  possible  timing,  as  I  descending
steep brushy forest to intersect the Panjab Trail. It didn\'t rain  long  but
it was enough get both the brush and me wet. Once I was on the  trail  again
it quit.

Trip out: 8.5 miles, 550 ft and 5:30 hrs

Trip Total: 33.5 miles and 7000 ft in 3 days

Jim graciously allowed me to tag along on his trip with Kevin and Eileen  to
a base camp at Kitling Pass.  While the three of  them  then  climbed  Kimta
(which I had already done years ago), I entertained myself  with  these  two
lesser peaks north of the pass. While not in the  same  category  as  higher
Ragged Ridge they were both  very  enjoyable  scrambles  in  a  very  scenic
setting. In fact I would consider a trip to Kitling Pass in  and  of  itself
well worth the trip.

Weather was partly sunny all three days, with minor  short  lived  sprinkles
Friday going in and some high fog late Saturday afternoon.

Friday, June 7 - We took the Easy Pass Trail to about  4000  feet  and  then
contoured for over a mile through reasonable forest (some  minor  brush  and
downed trees) to Kitling  Creek.  Snow  began  shortly  after  entering  the
valley at 4200 ft. We followed the creek through an open basin (short  patch
of slide alder to bash through) past Kitling Lake to Kitling Pass.  This  is
an  unusually  broad  interesting  feature,  over  a  quarter   mile   long,
connecting Kitling and Panther Creeks. We camped at  the  far  west  end  in
full view of Mesahchie and Kimta Peaks, elevation 5960 ft. Truly a  gorgeous
spot.

Day Total: 4.5 miles, 2400 ft and 5:30 hrs.

Saturday, June 8 - I had a leisurely morning, starting  a  full  hour  after
watching the others take off for Kimta. I began  by  climbing  to  the  wide
6300 ft saddle directly north of camp. Heading for Pk 6865 first, I  decided
a ridge route looked questionably so descended  about  400  ft  to  traverse
under cliffs to a gully that allowed a way back up  to  the  corniced  ridge
very near the summit. I reached the top at 11:30 (1300 ft, 2:30 hrs). I  had
a stunning view of the entire length of Ragged Ridge and spent an  enjoyable
hour in the sun absorbing it. I had hoped to spot my friends as I could  see
the majority of their route but I was not able to do so.

The actual summit was a snow mound so I don\'t know if  a  cairn  was  buried
underneath. In any event I built one of my own and placed a  small  register
in the rocks just below before leaving. Just for fun I tried  to  return  by
staying on the ridge, but as I feared it did not go. I  ended  up  retracing
my up route. Once below the cliffs I began a long traverse around  the  head
of the basin to regain the ridge of Pk 6882. This gentle ridge  was  a  pure
delight, though it did seem to go on forever. There was also  a  short  rock
step to overcome. I reached the summit at 4:30 (2750 ft, 7:30 hrs)  where  I
found no cairn. Here Ragged Ridge was somewhat obstructed  by  the  Pk  6865
ridge but I did have nice views of Gabriel, Elijah and Beebe.

I left at 5:00 and was back to camp by  6:45.  Not  surprising,  my  friends
were not back yet. I really didn\'t  expect  them  for  several  more  hours.
Meanwhile I relaxed and ate dinner. When they still hadn\'t shown  up  as  it
began to get dark (and cold) I turned in. I was awaked by  their  return  at
11:00 and stayed up until 12:00 entertained by tales  of  their  adventures.
They were happy but very tired climbers.

Day Total: 5 miles, 3050 ft and 9:45 hrs

Sunday, June 9 - Considering the late night we got going at  the  reasonable
hour of 9:00. On the trip out through Kitling Basin we  came  upon  a  fresh
avalanche that had not been there on the way in. It had started  high  above
and come down a scary looking  deep  gully  to  spread  out  a  considerable
distance over the flattish basin. A reminder  that  slides  that  can  still
happen at any time. We took the forest traverse on a better lower tack  than
our in route and hit the trail right at the bridge over  Granite  Creek.  It
couldn\'t have been more perfect.

Day Total: 4.5 miles, 100 ft and 4:45 hrs

Mt Torment (8120+ ft - P200 - Forbidden Pk Quad) - June 14-17, 2013

The third time is the charm. I had tried Torment twice last year, first  via
the SE Face (stopped by the moat) then via the South Ridge (stopped by  lack
of time and sketchy loose exposed rock).  Then Tom told me he had skied  the
NW Glacier (in a day!) and thought it might be a viable route for me. If  he
had skied it how hard could it be? Well a lot harder than  I  envisioned.  I
should have known. Tom had done it in mid-May 2011 when  snow  covered  many
of the obstacles and, after all, it was Tom who has no fear of  steep  snow.
That said I did make it go but it was dicey and I was almost too late.  This
route is best done in early season.

Friday, June 14 - I found the start of  climber\'s  trail  to  Torment  Basin
just past the bridge over the  Cascade  River,  elevation  2360  ft.  It  is
unmarked but there is a small turnout large enough  for  two  cars  directly
opposite. The trail is steep but fairly easily  followed  at  first  through
brushless forest along a rib near Torment Creek.  There  is  the  odd  cairn
here and there marking the way. After about 2000 ft I ran into a section  of
downed trees on a side hill. Above that I started running into  patchy  snow
and lost the trail completely, but nowhere was  anything  really  difficult.
Eventually I was forced left, crossing a minor creek to avoid  a  waterfall,
and soon after encountered solid snow slopes alongside a cliff  wall.  Above
that I entered wide open Torment Basin which is a  mirror  image  of  Boston
Basin but wilder. I found a tiny but comfortable  spot  for  my  bivy  on  a
minor rock rib with boulders conveniently  placed  for  a  table  and  chair
several hundred feet below Torment Col, elevation 6360. I was  surprised  to
intersect a fresh boot track coming from Boston Basin  very  near  here  and
continuing up. I wondered  where  this  party  was  headed.  I  found  water
dripping off a rock wall slightly above me.

Day Total: 2 miles, 4250 ft and 6:30 hrs

Saturday, June 15 - It froze  solid  during  the  night  and  crampons  were
needed from the get go. I followed the boot track to Torment Col (elev  6700
ft) where I discovered a party of eight had camped overnight. They had  left
slightly before I arrived and were heading up the slopes on More  Rain  Mtn.
My guess is they were on some long traverse, perhaps to Eldorado or  beyond.
There are nice places to camp at the col  and  there  was  even  a  pool  of
water.

From the col I descended easy slopes to  5800  ft.  Here  is  where  it  got
tricky. I had to cross the steep gully that goes down to Moraine  Lake,  get
onto the rock rib on the other side and somehow get onto the glacier  below.
Beckey mentions a 150 ft rappel and slab  problems  here.   I  managed  with
some down climbing and two rappels with my 120 ft rope. At the  last  rappel
I looked up and didn\'t think I could reverse it  so  decided  to  leave  the
rope in place. This left me without a  rope  for  the  rest  of  the  climb,
rather chancy.

I descended a bit more until I could gain access to the  snow  at  5600  ft.
This is a far western arm of the Forbidden Glacier generally referred to  as
the NW Glacier. Once on the snow it was pretty straightforward  until  below
the bergschrund (elev 7250 ft), although it  does  cross  a  vast  avalanche
deposition  zone  with  deep  slide  runnels  which  was  a  bit  unnerving.
Fortunately nothing came down while I was there. However, surrounding  areas
were active with icefalls all day long,  especially  the  lower  Inspiration
Glacier. I was happy to see a snow bridge crossing  the  left  side  of  the
bergschrund but it was thinner than it first appeared and I don\'t  think  it
will remain crossable for very long.

Above the bergschrund was 800 feet of consistent 40 degree snow with no  run
out. A slip would be a fall over cliffs or into  the  bergschrund  or  both.
This is what freaked me out the most. I almost threw in the towel  here  and
turned around. If the snow had been harder I would have.  The  view  up  the
unrelentingly steep slope was very intimidating. The only way I felt  secure
was to use the ice ax self-belay with every step. The snow was solid  enough
yet soft enough for this to work though I sometimes had to jam it 2-3  times
to get it all the way in. So I would jam the ax in, take a step and  repeat,
endlessly. Very slow and tiring. It seemed to take forever and there was  no
place to rest. It took close to 2 hours to do those  800  ft.  As  the  snow
gentled below the summit rocks I was elated to see the final bit was just  a
scramble. I pulled onto the  summit  at  3:00  (2800  ft,  7:30  hrs).   The
register was almost completely full but I found a small space to sign in.

I stayed about 40 minutes on the summit but could not fully enjoy  the  warm
sunshine and expansive views as I  was  very  worried  about  getting  down.
While there a medium slide came down over the top of  the  bergschrund  onto
my up route below. This did nothing to help my  confidence.  However,  going
down turned out not to be as  bad  as  anticipated  though  still  slow  and
intense and I had to concentrate completely. The snow was softer and  I  had
the use of my up steps and ax holes. The snow was still solid and  no  steps
broke out. After I gingerly crossed the berschrund I almost felt a  sign  of
relief but I still had one more major obstacle to surmount, the rappel.  The
snow lower down was very soft now and I postholed knee deep in places.

 I reached the rappel rope at 7:15. I proceeded to spend the next  1:45  hrs
trying to get up and could not. I first tried going  straight  up  the  rope
using a prusik belay but there were no holds. I  am  not  strong  enough  to
pull myself up by my arms. I really needed ascenders which I didn\'t have.  I
tried to the side where there were more holds but it was wet and  slick  and
a fall would result in a pendulum. I tried around the corner  but  the  rope
then wasn\'t above me and I essentially had  no  belay.  I  tried  again  and
again and failed. I envisioned myself falling  onto  the  prusik  unable  to
move up or down. What an ignominious end to it all that would  be.  What  is
the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over  and  over  again  and
expecting a different result! This was not working. I was  too  hung  up  on
following the rope. I had  to  try  something  different.  That  is  when  I
decided to look at  the  gully.  It  appeared  sketchy  but  I  was  getting
desperate and so went for it. I rappelled into the gully and climbed up  the
steep snow. There were a couple of thin sections to get past but  they  were
not too bad. I remembered seeing an old rappel sling lower down  near  where
I got onto the glacier  and  it  now  occurred  to  me  that  other  parties
probably also got out by rappelling into the gully.

At 9:10 I topped out of the gully onto gentle slopes. I still  had  the  800
feet to climb up to Torment Col but the fact that I was safe now  and  would
not end my days on Torment gave an added spring to my step.  I  crossed  the
col, filled up on water at the pool and collapsed in camp at  11:00  totally
fried physically and especially mentally. I had surpassed my  tolerance  for
scary.

Day Total: 4 miles, 3850 ft and 15:30 hrs

Sunday: June 16 - I slept in until the sun hit my bivy at 8:30 and  left  at
10:45. It had not frozen overnight and the snow was soft and slushy. It  was
also sticky and tended to ball up on my boots. I had several  slips  due  to
this on the way down. I was so happy I had not had  these  snow  conditions,
which undermine what confidence I do have, on the climb itself. The rest  of
the trip out was straightforward and I reached the  car  at  2:30  happy  to
leave my torment behind.

Day Total: 2 miles, 50 feet and 3:45 hrs.

Trip Total: 8 miles and 8150 ft in 3 days

After Torment I was looking for  something  mellow  and  (relatively)  safe.
Jim graciously once again allowed me tag along to base camp  on  a  trip  of
his, this time to climb Clark Mtn via the Walrus Glacier.  I  would  not  be
doing Clark but saw that there was a peak south of Boulder Pass  I  had  not
climbed that could occupy my time while the others (Eileen, Deb,  Steve  and
Lisa) were on Clark. My main goal was to get out with friends yet not  trash
myself.

Friday: June 21 - We followed the  White  River  Trail  4  miles,  then  the
Boulder Creek trail another 4.5 miles to a camp in  Boulder  Basin  at  4900
ft. Both trails were in good shape, the only  impediment  to  travel  a  few
blow downs and the upper ford of Boulder Cr (cold!). We  found  bare  ground
just large enough to squeeze in two tents, side by side -  Deb  and  Steve\'s
and Lisa and mine. Jim and Eileen tented on snow. We arrived earlier in  the
day than usual which made for a leisurely sociable dinner and bedtime  while
still light.

Day Total: 8.5 miles, 3000 ft and 6 hrs

Saturday: June 22 - We all had breakfast together then the others  took  off
at 7:20. I left  about  an  hour  later  delayed  a  good  20  minutes  with
difficulties fitting my crampons to my new boots. They were  too  small  for
the connecting plate which I had to let hang over the heel.  I  should  have
checked this at home before leaving as I frequently  have  this  problem.  I
made them work on the hard snow of morning and began by climbing  up  slopes
directly east of camp. White Mtns turned out to be a lot more craggy than  I
expected with much of the west side essentially a  continuous  wall,  but  I
teased out a route up steepening snow to the highest  point  possible  where
the cliff was broken and short and an  easy  scramble.  Once  on  the  ridge
proper the west side was gentle  and  a  pleasant  walkup.   I  reached  the
summit at 12:00 (2100 ft, 3:45 hrs).

The day had started sunny, then clouded up to  the  point  where  Clark  was
shrouded in fog. I feared the weather was turning but I had warm  sun  again
for my hour summit stay. It  continued  to  improve  during  the  afternoon.
Before leaving I built a cairn and left a register.  It  was  too  early  to
return to camp so after I was below all the cliffs I continued  on  an  easy
traverse to Boulder Pass at 3:30. I could see my friend\'s tracks where  they
had dropped off the pass to head for the Walrus Glacier. Earlier in the  day
as I was climbing my peak had actually seen them on this slope  through  the
telephoto lens of my camera.

After enjoying the view for 30 minutes or  so  I  headed  down  to  camp.  I
wanted to return via the route of the  trail.  I  had  hoped  to  follow  my
friend\'s tracks but could not find them on this side of the  pass.  I  guess
the snow was too hard in the morning. I had a little  trouble  locating  the
trail but eventually did so with the help of my GPS. About half way  down  I
ran into a Mountaineer party of 9. They were planning to camp  at  the  pass
and climb the Walrus the next day. I think they were puzzled as where I  had
come from and what I had done. I am kind of used to that. I reached camp  at
5:00 and had plenty of time to dry clothes in the full sun  and  rest  until
everyone else showed up at 8:00. They were all on a summit high and  we  had
another fun sociable dinner together.

Day Total: 4.5 miles, 2750 ft and 8:45 hrs.

Sunday:  June  23  -  The  day  downed  cloudy  and  with  a   forecast   of
deteriorating weather we didn\'t tarry too long in camp. We left at 8:40  and
with very few stops reached the cars at 1:20. But during breakfast  we  took
the time to witness a landmark event - the first  meeting  between  Francine
and Freddy. I think it was love at first sight. I am going to have  to  keep
an eye on Freddy on future trips with Francine or I may find  him  wandering
off getting into mischief.

Day Total: 8.5 miles, 250 ft and 4:45 hrs.

Trip Total: 21.5 miles and 6000 ft in 3 days

Whatcom Pass - Red Face Mtn (7141 ft - P1341 - Mt Redoubt Quad) -  July  24-
28, 2013

This was the second annual Girl\'s Trip organized by Eileen (in  response  to
and at the same time as Jim\'s Guy\'s Trip). The main goal  was  to  have  fun
and enjoy each other\'s company. Some of us had also hoped to  climb  Whatcom
Peak but snow conditions  had  other  ideas  and  that  didn\'t  happen.  But
Whatcom Pass is a lovely area in itself,  beautiful  Tapto  Lakes  are  well
worth the price of admission and the cable car crossing  of  the  Chilliwack
River is a hoot. I also managed to get up Red Face Mtn ending  my  July  dry
streak of no summits. Also on this trip, in addition to Eileen  and  myself,
were Maria, Tiffany and Beth

Day 1 - We hiked up the very hot trail to Hannegan  Pass.  The  black  flies
that had started the previous week in the Pickets were  out  in  full  force
once again. From the pass we dropped into the Chilliwack  River  valley  and
camped at spacious US Cabin. Miraculously the bugs were  dormant  there  and
we had a pleasant evening.

Day Total: - 10 miles, 2150 ft and 7 hrs

Day 2 - A half mile from US Cabin we had the joy of crossing the  Chilliwack
River on the cable car. What a fun experience. I had never done this  before
and have never seen anything like this crossing in the  backcountry.  It  is
very safe and well engineered although it does require a little more  muscle
than my wimpy arms can supply alone. Past the cable car the trail  traverses
a mile to the bridge across Brush Cr. Shortly above that is the junction  to
Whatcom Pass. The trail is in good shape although somewhat  brushy  in  open
areas.  Black flies were bad. While resting at the  Graybeal  Camp  junction
who should we run into coming down the trail but Greg  on  his  marathon  24
miles trek to retrieve their car at Hannegan TH. Stefan and  Matt  had  gone
the other  way  out  to  Ross  Lake.  We  chatted  for  a  good  30  minutes
commiserating about none  of  us  getting  Crooked  Thumb.  We  pulled  into
Whatcom Camp at 5:00 having it all to ourselves. The black flies  diminished
in the evening only to be replaced by noseeums.

Day Total: 7 miles, 2700 ft and 8 hrs

Day 3 - Tiffany, Beth and I started for Whatcom Peak while Maria and  Eileen
lounged in camp planning to spend  the  day  at  Tapto  Lakes.  Eileen  also
thought she might go for Red Face Mtn above the lakes.  My  party  hiked  to
Whatcom Pass and took  the  climbers  trail  right  planning  on  traversing
around Whatcom to the easy south side. However, when we got a  look  at  the
Whatcom Glacier it was so broken up as to  look  impassible  to  us.  So  we
continued up the arm to the North Ridge. But on closer inspection  that  too
looked intimidating. It had more snow on the upper section than  I  expected
which was very steep and  very  exposed.  I  just  wasn\'t  mentally  up  for
anything that scary on this trip.

We all went back to Whatcom Pass. Beth returned to camp  to  drop  off  gear
and change boots  while  Tiffany  and  I  took  the  trail  to  Tapto  Lakes
together. I was planning to climb Red Face. On the ridge above the lakes  we
ran into Maria who had accompanied Eileen part way up Pt 6921 on her way  to
Red Face. Maria had enough and was heading down to the lakes. Tiffany and  I
continued up. On top of Pt 6921 we spotted Eileen past the saddle  near  the
Red Face ridge. At this point, with a nasty descent  to  the  saddle  below,
Tiffany had enough and retreated to  the  lakes.  I  still  hoped  to  catch
Eileen. I descended to the saddle, not difficult but slow and  not  terribly
pleasant, then went up loose rock to the ridge. Once on  the  ridge  it  was
quite enjoyable. I came upon Eileen waiting just below the summit  horn.  It
was more than she wanted to do  without  a  rope  and  since  she  had  been
waiting over 30 minutes was ready to leave.  I  was  determined  not  to  be
skunked again. The final bit was not more than class 3+  and  short  but  it
was very exposed. I managed to get up it by crawling along the  very  crest.
It was actually pretty fun. Not as much fun coming down but I  did  make  it
safely, and then headed back along the ridge to  near  the  saddle  with  Pt
6921. From there I went straight down to the  lakes  where  I  met  up  with
everyone else. We spent the rest  of  the  afternoon  relaxing,  eating  and
cooling off in the water. The lakes were gorgeous and  the  bugs  reasonable
so no one was in a hurry to leave. We finally left to reach camp at 7:30  by
which time at least the flies were gone.

Day Total: 6 miles, 4050 ft and 11:30 hrs

Day 4 - We hiked down the trail, had good times on the  cable  car  crossing
again then hiked up to Copper Cr Camp for the night. While we  were  gone  a
group of boy scouts were doing some  badly  needed  brushing  of  the  trail
which was much appreciated. They were camped at US Cabin.

Day Total: 9.5 miles, 1100 ft and 8 hrs

Day 5 - This day was a little cooler than on  the  way  in  which  helped  a
little with both the bugs and the heat  climbing  to  Hannegan  Pass  again.
Still the trip out seemed longer than it should be what with feet tired  and
sore from multiple long July trips.

Day Total: 7.5 miles, 2050 ft and 5:45 hrs

Trip Total: 40 miles and 12,050 ft in 5 days

We sure gave it our all and got darn close (to 170 ft of the top) and had great fun meeting the many challenges and problems thrown our way. We worked very well together as a team. If it weren\'t for the bad luck of having the only rain in the entire month of July coincide with our two summit days we probably would have made it. 

Day 1 - We caught the boat for Big Beaver at 1:00 and hiked to Luna Camp.
Day Total: 11 miles, 1400 ft and 6 hrs

Day 2 - We continued on the trail to just before Big Beaver Shelter and headed up Eiley-Wiley Ridge. We had been up this way last year and I had waypoints marked on my GPS that helped us find the best way to the ridge. Our route was almost brush free except for that which cannot be avoided at the beginning in the flat crossing the creeks. Once past that it is semi open forest. It is however very steep duff with poor footing and I especially suffered in the heat with a pack much heavier than I am accustomed to. We broke out into subalpine terrain about 5500 ft and picked up the remarkably good climber\'s trail along the ridge. At a 6200 ft notch where the ridge turned cliffy we dropped left on a steep grass and dirt traverse into a lovely basin with a bubbling pool at 6000 ft for camp 2.
Day Total: 6.5 miles, 4300 ft and 10 hrs

Day 3 - We climbed back up to about 6600 ft and traversed below cliffs at a key spot marked by a cairn through some thick scrub then descended and followed open crest up and down past first Eiley then Wiley Lake. This section of the route is delightful and very scenic. We were making good time and ahead of schedule until hitting the notch closely SE of Pk 7374. It was easily gained but a 20 ft vertical snow wall on the other side prevented direct access to the route off the other side onto the Challenger Glacier. Where the heck did this come from? I don\'t remember it from last year. We had to drop about 400 ft to work our way past the wall then climb up again. Once on the Challenger Glacier it was easily followed to the West Challenger Notch although there were more crevasses opened up than last year even though we were earlier in the season.
At the West Challenger notch we found a rap sling at the skier\'s right gully which lured me into going down that way. The better gully is the one on the skiers left.  The rap was very awkward with a full pack and our rope (37 M) wasn\'t quite long enough. We had to downclimb into the moat and climb out of it. We lost more time here. Continuous snow, steep at first, led down to the gentle glacier below which had a surprising number of parallel small crevasses. Fortunately they were all easily stepped over. We headed for a rock rib at the far edge expecting to find bivy sites. We found none. So while I went in search of water (I found none) Eileen worked on excavating a spot for our tiny tent. Meanwhile the wind kicked up and by the time we put up the tent it was blowing steadily at 40-50 mph. It took us over an hour to get the thing up and reinforced so the wind wouldn\'t blow it away. Low on water with the wind threatening all night to shred the tent we got little sleep that night, which didn\'t bode well for our summit day on the morrow.
Day Total:  6 miles, 3500 ft and 12 hrs

Day 4 - Somehow my tent made it intact through the night. The wind was still blowing in the morning, but with somewhat less intensity, which contributed to a late start. We headed up the right side of the glacier encountering several large crevasses at the steepest section. It leveled off to a flat area above where we began a downward traverse to the base of the hidden snow finger. I was dismayed to discover that a very steep slope with a moat almost all the way across guarded access to the finger and that it was rock hard. We protected it with our 2 flukes but I was totally freaked out and very slow. I almost gave up here. What kept me going was I didn\'t want to downclimb with the snow so hard. Once I reached the finger proper things improved as it was in the sun, softer and not as steep. Where the snow ended we moved right into a rock gully, scrambled to the headwall, took ledges right and worked our way onto the ridge. The section along the ridge with big blocks was actually fun. Near the summit horn I got confused as to how to corkscrew around to the south side. I first took a low ledge that led nowhere. By the time I found the proper ledge it was 5:00 and we could see weather heading our way. In fact it looked as if it was already raining all around us. Had the weather looked stable I believe we would have elected to continue with an enroute bivy. But no way did we want to be on the peak in rain. So reluctantly, within 170 ft of the summit, we turned around and started down at 5:30. Several rappels got us down the rock. The snow was much softer now but we still protected the steep section with flukes. We made it back to camp at 10:00 just as it began to rain in earnest. It rained steadily all night, with wind and thunder added for good measure.
Day Total: 1 mile, 1500 ft and 12:30 hrs

Day 5 - It was still raining in the morning so we went back to sleep. We didn\'t even consider Phantom. Our climbing trip was all but ended. About noon the rain and wind quit so we packed up and left at 1:00. Out immediate concern was how to get back over the West Challenger Notch. We didn\'t think we could climb up our rappel route on climbers left, at least not with full packs. This time though we checked out the other notch on climbers right. It was much easier and could be scrambled. We should have gone that way in the first place, but the bridge across the moat was thin and didn\'t look like it would last much longer. Once at the notch we thought our troubles were over only to be confronted by a complete whiteout on the Challenger Glacier. This caused some consternation as we tiptoed slowly down while waiting for gaps in the fog to appear so we could find the route. Soon we were below the fog and joyously made our way to my favorite campsite in the whole wide world (below Pk 7473). I have now camped there 4 times in 3 different years. It is truly a gorgeous spot.
Day Total: 2.5 miles, 1300 ft and 6 hrs

Day 6 - The day dawned clear. We took it easy stopping often to enjoy the spectacular scenery. All we had to do was get to the basin of camp 2. Our only obstacle was getting off Pk 7473 which we did by following the ridge north to an easy step onto the glacier above Wiley Lake. We pulled into camp at 4:30 with lots of time to wash up, rest and rehydrate with plentiful water.
Day Total: 3.5 miles, 1000 ft and 6 hrs

Day 7 - Our goal today was Luna Camp. Once back on the ridge we enjoyed our last pleasant rest on a scenic promontory before plunging steeply down to Big Beaver. We had a slight misstep by following a well beaten trail to the left that soon ended in brush. We knew we needed to be farther right to get on our up route and worked our way in that direction. The route was good but during our time up high there had been a hatch of black flies that tormented us all the way down. It was so bad that even Eileen, who always hikes in shorts, had to cover up with long sleeves and pants. They were with us most of the way to Luna Camp.
Day Total: 6.5 miles, 700 ft and 9 hrs

Day 8 - We hiked to Big Beaver landing, caught the boat at 2:30 and hike up to the Ross Lake TH to end another fantastic trip into the remarkable Northern Pickets.
Day Total: 11 miles, 1000 ft and 6 hrs

Baekos Pk (7529 ft - P449 - Glacier Pk West Quad) - August 7-9, 2013

Baekos is an attractive multi-pinnacled peak rising above  the  NW  edge  of
the White Chuck Glacier on Glacier Peak. It caught my eye when Mike T and  I
climbed Kololo two years ago but we  didn\'t  have  the  time  or  energy  to
include it on that trip. It gave me a good excuse to return to lovely  White
Chuck Basin. However, I could find no beta at all for this peak and knew  no
one who had climbed it. It did look as if it could  be  difficult  but  just
how difficult I had no clue. So I went prepared  with  rope,  harness,  full
alpine rack and crampons. As it turned out I only used the rope but  it  was
a close call. All this uncertainty added to the allure as I love  to  figure
out my own route on seldom climbed peaks.

Wednesday, August 7 - Jim Brisbine had organized a 6 day trip with  7  other
people (beginning the previous  Sunday)  starting  from  Lost  Creek  Ridge,
going over Glacier Peak via the Kennedy  Glacier  and  Frostbite  Ridge  and
coming out the North Fork Sauk. I had no interest in a carryover on  Glacier
but thought this would the perfect opportunity to go for Baekos. Their  last
camp would be in Foam Creek Basin which would also make a  great  base  camp
for me for two nights. If all went well I would meet up  with  them  at  the
end of both our climbs, though I  was  totally  prepared  for  this  not  to
happen.

Starting from the North Fork Sauk TH at 10:45, it  was  5.5  easy  miles  on
excellent trail to Mackinaw Shelter. However, my pack  was  heavier  than  I
would have liked loaded as it was with climbing gear  and  I  was  not  very
fast. I was even slower beyond the shelter as I plodded up the  interminable
switchbacks in the heat of day plagued by biting black flies. I suffered  on
this section. Both the bugs and the heat diminished as I neared White  Pass.
Things improved even more on the lovely Foam Creek Trail,  but  my  intended
campsite in Foam Creek Basin still seemed a long ways off (a good  2  miles)
and I was running out of time. I followed this trail, which has  become  the
main route for climbing Glacier Peak and is well used, to  a  cairn  marking
the junction with the climber\'s path going uphill. Past here the Foam  Creek
Trail rapidly fades until I lost it completely. Steep terrain bars a  direct
descent into Foam Creek Basin. I had to drop about 500 feet only  to  regain
200 to get to my intended camp where I found a flat site at 7:45 right  next
to a babbling creek. However, even though I had had very little all  day,  I
now had gale force winds that hampered putting up my tent,  using  my  stove
for dinner and kept me awake much of the night. Where  the  heck  did  these
come from?

Day Total: 11.5 miles, 4700 ft and 9 hrs

Thursday, August 8 - It was still windy in the morning, though much less  so
and I was able to get the stove going for a cup of hot tea.  I  started  for
Baekos at 7:45 by climbing uphill to intersect  the  climber\'s  trail  going
over 6600 ft "Foam Pass" where I was greeted by a  gorgeous  view  of  White
Chuck Basin and Glacier Peak. I dropped on the climber\'s trail  then  headed
straight for Baekos at the far end of the basin. It ended  up  being  harder
to get to than it had first appeared. I could not  make  a  direct  approach
due to a large meltwater lake (not shown on the  map  and  evidently  a  new
addition formed by the receding glacier) that was difficult to  get  around.
I had to go up over a shoulder then down awful  loose  steep  dirt  to  drop
into the basin at the foot of my peak, below the  large  lake,  where  there
was a second smaller lake. Then I had  to  get  across  the  rushing  outlet
creek (the headwaters of the White Chuck River). I could see no  way  across
other than wading. It was not that wide but it was fast and the water  milky
so I could not tell how deep it was and the footing was insecure.

Once across the creek I headed uphill to a broad saddle  SE  of  the  summit
staying right of an unattractive gully on steep  but  easy  heather.  I  had
hoped that an easy route would present itself once at the saddle. Instead  I
was dismayed by a series of difficult looking pinnacles and  cliffs.  I  had
no idea where to go from  here.  So  I  sat  down  to  have  a  snack  while
pondering the situation. To aid  in  the  description  I  have  labeled  the
pinnacles 1 to 3 starting from the saddle. I first had to get past  pinnacle
1 directly above and left of the saddle. I could see  a  ramp  heading  left
across its face but I feared this would lead to  an  impasse  on  the  other
side. The right side was all cliff. Across the saddle a steep snowslope  led
up between pinnacle 1 and pinnacle 2 but I couldn\'t see how far it went  and
it appeared to end in a cliff. Still, this seemed my  best  bet.  So  off  I
went in that direction. Miraculously I was able to exit the snow at  a  nice
spot onto class 3 rock that  I  could  easily  scramble  to  a  notch  below
pinnacle 2.

Once at the notch I  could  see  nowhere  else  to  go  except  directly  up
pinnacle 2, which looked beyond my capabilities. Still, I had  to  try.  The
first part was much easier than it had appeared. Then  I  came  to  a  wall.
Here I put on my harness and geared up just in case. I also left  everything
else behind except my PLB, water bottle and register to  make  the  climbing
moves easier. As it turned out I was able to traverse  to  the  right  below
the wall and then go up a series of ledges. There was  nothing  harder  than
class 4, if even that, but it was exposed and the rock loose.  I  went  very
slowly carefully testing each hold. I never used my rope or pro.

I pulled over the top of pinnacle 2 thinking I had it made only to  see  the
summit still .1 mile away and a pinnacle 3 in the way. Again it was  not  as
hard as it first appeared (I was able to bypass pinnacle  3  easily  on  the
left) and in fact was an enjoyable mostly ridge top scramble. I reached  the
summit at 1:15 (2600 ft, 5:50 hrs). I stayed only long  enough  to  build  a
cairn, place my register and snap some photos as  my  food  and  more  water
were back at the base of the wall. To return I did one rappel  directly  off
the end of pinnacle 2 over the wall to avoid downclimbing the exposed  ledge
traverse. With that out of the way I could then relax and  enjoy  eating  my
lunch.

I reversed the rest of my route without difficulty. Once down  to  the  lake
basin I decided to return by going past Pk 6810 via a route I saw  from  the
summit as I didn\'t want to repeat  the  loose  slope  above  the  big  lake.
Actually, this way was no better and I ran into more awful loose steep  dirt
traverses. I guess there is no pleasant way to  the  lake  basin  after  the
snow has melted. But once on the flat to the  SE,  which  contained  another
tarn, it was easy going up the ridge to the summit of Pk 6810  (P390)  where
I had a great view of my route up Baekos.

From 6810 I wandered pleasant terrain past more tarns and meadows to make  a
loop through White Chuck Basin and  reconnect  with  my  in  route.  Shortly
below Foam Pass, at about 5:45, I spied a  party  of  3  crossing  the  snow
above me. It turned out to be Steve, Tim and Cassie. What luck to  run  into
Jim\'s party coming off Kololo. I hiked the rest of the way with  Steve.  Deb
and Eileen were already ahead near my camp and Jim, Beth and Kevin were  not
far behind in the other direction. We all united in camp. It was a good  day
for me in the mountains. I had a challenging successful solo climb  followed
by the company of good friends in camp. What could be better?

Day Total: 7.5 miles, 3900 ft and 10:45 hrs

Friday, August 9  -  I  hiked  to  White  Pass  with  Eileen.  Here  we  all
reconnected. Jim, Eileen, Kevin, Cassie and Tim  went  up  White  Mtn  while
Steve, Deb, Beth and I headed down the trail. I never  saw  Jim  and  Eileen
again. The switchbacks were miserably hot and buggy once again but at  least
we were going downhill. Fast Kevin, Tim and Cassie  caught  us  at  Mackinaw
and soon passed us never to be seen again either.   The  four  of  us  stuck
together the rest of the way out taking several long  breaks,  most  notably
at Red Creek to soak aching feet. Shortly before the  TH  we  had  one  loud
clap of thunder then a brief shower which actually felt good.

We reached the TH at 5:15. It would have  been  a  great  end  to  the  trip
except that I was greeted with a flat tire on  my  Subaru.  Steve  gallantly
changed it for me, and then followed me all the  way  to  Granite  Falls  to
make sure I reached civilization safely. That was  much  appreciated  as  my
spare was one of those "fake" small tire that do nothing to  make  you  felt
secure on back roads and adversely affect the handling of  an  AWD.  I  hate
those spares. All my jeeps have always had a full sized spare. Yes,  friends
are useful for things other than good company. Thank you Steve.

Day Total: 11.5 miles, 900 ft and 8:45 hrs

Trip Total: 30.5 miles and 9500 ft in 3 days

P.S. I made it all the way home (over 100 miles) on  that  wimpy  spare  and
had the tire fixed the next day. The flat was caused by a sharp rock  caught
in the tread.

June 10th Pk (6019 ft - P1139 - Chimney Pk Quad) - August 13-15, 2013

This was essentially to be a reconnaissance trip to  see  if  Pyrites  Creek
would be a feasible route to approach seldom climbed  Chimney  Peak  and  Mt
Delabarre.  I knew my allotted 3 days was not enough time for either. But  I
did hope to get up one or more of the  peaks  located  around  the  head  of
Pyrites Creek. The forecast I had before leaving town was for light rain  to
come in Wednesday  after  6  pm  with  heavier  rain  that  night  and  into
Thursday. I thought this would give me enough time to do what  I  wanted  on
Wednesday. I could then go out in the rain. It didn\'t quite  work  out  that
way. And I may have to rethink this as a good route to  those  more  distant
peaks. It was not all that easy. Then again I doubt there is any easy way.

Tuesday, August 13 - I hiked up the Enchanted Valley Trail 9.5 miles  taking
5:15 hours to arrive at Pyrites Creek at 4:20. In  general  I  am  not  that
fond of long river trails, but this one is lovely  rainforest  and  the  day
was relatively cool with minimal bugs so it was fairly  pleasant  going.  On
the north side of the creek I headed uphill hoping  to  find  the  abandoned
trail. I did run into sections of it here and there but I couldn\'t  stay  on
it long and it wasn\'t that useful to  try  and  do  so.  The  old  trail  is
essentially gone. However, for the first  1000  feet  no  trail  was  really
needed in the open forest and it was often easier to just  go  straight  up.
After that the going got more difficult with more brush and steep  sidehill.
I made the mistake (corrected on the way down)  of  climbing  too  high  too
soon, ran into cliffs where I had to descend on very  steep  duff  to  avoid
them and probably lost an hour. By then it was getting late  enough  that  I
knew I wouldn\'t make my originally planned campsite at timberline  near  the
East Fork of Pyrites Creek. In fact I was  getting  desperate  to  find  any
place with water when I stumbled upon a site in the forest at  3600  ft  (so
flat it needed no embellishment) that had a small brook right  next  to  it.
What good luck! It was 8:20 and almost dark.

Day Total: 11.5 miles, 4300 ft and 9:20 hrs

Wednesday, August 14 - I decided my first goal of the day would be to  climb
June 10th Peak. To get to it I would have to make a long  horseshoe  circuit
around the head of Pyrites Creek. From camp I traversed to the  deep  ravine
of the East Fork and climbed along its edge in open forest to where I  could
cross near timberline at 4400 ft. This took an hour. Once across the  ravine
I proceeded on a long  up  and  down  traverse  through  alternating  brushy
meadows and steep forest to the 4840  ft  saddle  at  the  head  of  Pyrites
Creek. The occasional elk trail helped. I reached the saddle at 11:15  (1700
ft and 3:15 hrs). I dropped slightly from the saddle and picked  up  a  very
good elk trail that took me on  the  second  leg  of  the  horseshoe  across
seemingly impassible steep sidehill until past Pt 5565. From  there  meadows
and scree led to the NE ridge of  the  peak.  From  a  distance  this  ridge
looked straightforward but on closer inspection  was  more  convoluted  than
first appeared with a series of knobs and steps to overcome which I  did  by
staying mostly on the very crest. The climber\'s guide calls it class  2  but
that is an understatement. I have  come  to  expect  this  -  but  class  2?
Really?  Two steps in particular gave me pause. The first was  a  steep  fin
about 40 ft high which I surmounted head on. It was difficult enough that  I
rappelled it on the way down. The second was a very short (5 ft?) step  with
one class 4 move. Fortunately it had a branch belay on the left or  I  would
have wanted a rope for it also. The rest  of  the  ridge  was  an  easy  fun
scramble. I reached the summit  at  1:35,  having  taken  much  longer  than
anticipated (3000 ft, 5:35 hrs).

I stayed 20 minutes on top to eat lunch, take pictures, build  a  cairn  and
place a register. I still had views into  some  the  remotest  area  of  the
Olympics but I could see weather coming and hurried  to  get  off  the  rock
before it hit. Sure enough the rain hit on the elk trail  traverse  back  to
saddle 4840. This was much sooner than the  forecast  and  it  wasn\'t  light
rain either.  It was heavy and steady. I am sure it rained at least Â½  inch.
By the time I was back  to  the  saddle  all  the  brush  was  wet  and  fog
enveloped everything. You just can\'t trust the weatherman. I  had  hoped  to
climb Pk 5827 on the way back, which looked very inviting  up  the  W  Ridge
from the saddle, but the rained put an end to that  notion.  Instead  I  had
hours of wet miserable slipping and sliding on  very  slick  vegetation  and
duff just to make it to camp. I couldn\'t seem to stay  upright  and  I  took
even longer going out than coming in. I was just thinking to  myself,  after
my umpteenth small slip, that it would be  a  miracle  if  I  made  it  back
without injuring myself when I lost it on a very slick section in the  woods
and slid down rough terrain about 10  ft  hitting  my  thigh  hard  on  some
obstacle  or  other.  Ouch!  That  really  hurt!  Fortunately  I  was  still
functional. It was only painful if inadvertently hit or  touched.  On  later
examination I discovered a grapefruit-sized swollen lump and ugly bruise  on
my left back thigh.

I managed to make it the rest of the way back to  my  welcome  camp  without
further incident. I was however, literally dripping wet.  Everything  I  had
on and everything in my pack was soaked despite rain gear and a pack  cover.
It is impossible to stay dry while wallowing in wet brush. I took refuge  in
my dry tent, carefully removed all my wet clothes and put them a  waterproof
stuff sack to keep them separated from my dry gear.  The  saving  grace  was
that it was so warm and muggy I never got cold. Still, a warm dinner, a  cup
of tea and a hot water bottle were very much appreciated.

Day Total: 7 miles, 3700 ft and 11:30 hrs

Thursday, August 15 - It wasn\'t raining in  the  morning,  which  thankfully
allowed me to stay dry while packing up. I could hardly believe it. In  fact
I had no rain all the way out. My conclusion was the front came  in  earlier
and stronger and left sooner than expected. However,  I  did  not  stay  dry
long.  My dry socks became soaked the minute I put on  already  soggy  boots
and I was soon drenched once again head to toe by the  still  wet  brush.  I
did slide some on the slick duff but avoided more damage to myself  and  hit
the trail at 11:00 (3 hrs).  Then it was just a matter of pounding  out  the
remaining 9.5 miles to the trailhead. My clothes dried while hiking  but  my
feet stayed wet all day. At the car I weighed my pack. It was  heavier  than
on the way in what with all that wet gear. This is not the natural order  of
things. Packs should be lighter on the way out.

Day Total: 11.5 miles, 1000 ft and 9:30 hrs

Trip Total: 29 miles and 9000 ft in 3 days

Mt Lawson (5401 ft - P2521 - Mt Christie Quad) - August 21-23, 2013

Mt Lawson is a seldom climbed peak located north of the  confluence  of  the
North Fork Quinault River and Rustler Creek. If  it  weren\'t  for  the  fact
that it has over 2000 feet of prominence I doubt  it  would  catch  anyone\'s
interest much at all as it is not that easy to get to or all  that  pleasant
a climb. Still, once on top it does provide a striking  viewpoint  into  the
heart of the Olympics. I deliberately went late in the season because I  was
worried I would have to ford the North Fork Quinault and wanted a low  river
level. The trade off was there was no snow in the gullies which made  travel
much more difficult and much slower. The irony was  I  ended  up  finding  a
convenient log anyway and did not need to ford. But this cannot  be  counted
on as yearly floods are constantly changing things. Shetter and Creeden  had
a log in 2009, but Klenke had none in 2005 nor did Boos on 2010. Both  those
crossings were challenging without one.

Wednesday, August 21 - I hiked the North Fork  Trail  10  miles  to  a  just
before where it takes a switchback and is in sight of  the  large  avalanche
cone across the river coming off the north side of Lawson. I was  pleasantly
surprised to see a log from the trail near a level spot  to  camp  right  on
the riverbank, elev 1700 ft.

Day Total: 10 miles, 2100 ft and 7 hrs.

Thursday, August 22 - I crossed on the log by  straddling,  slow  but  safe,
then hiked upstream to the avalanche cone and entered the  gully  (Gully  1)
on the right side, (generally following Shetter\'s  TR  directions).  It  was
dry to begin  but  had  water  higher  up.  I  followed  this  gully  to  an
intersection with another gully (Gully 2) on the  right  at  2400  ft.  This
gully was mostly easy talus but slow going and  I  kept  thinking  how  much
easier and faster it would have been with snow.  I knew  from  Shetter\'s  TR
that I was supposed to move right into a third  gully  (Gully  3)  at  about
3700 ft and kept looking for a place to do so. I could hear a stream on  the
right, supposedly in this gully, but didn\'t see a good place to  cross  into
it. Then I hit an impasse at cliffs that forced me to move right. I  climbed
up an awful dirt slope to a rib above Gully 3 and  was  shocked  to  see  it
filled with snow for a hundred feet or so. I had brought neither ice ax  not
crampons and knew I couldn\'t climb the snow and yet to  continue  I  had  to
somehow get past the snow and into the gully above. I lost  a  lot  of  time
considering various options, including ending the climb, as I could  see  no
obvious way out of this impasse.

Not one to give up easily, I first tried to continue  along  the  rib  above
the snow but that ended in a sketchy exposed hardpack  dirt  traverse  above
cliffs I wasn\'t willing to chance. I retreated back to my starting point  on
the rib. On closer examination a short (30 ft) but  steep  dirt  slope  went
down into the moat alongside the snow. I couldn\'t see around the  corner  to
how far it went but maybe I could crawl the moat. So I slid down  the  slope
(not being at all sure I would be able to climb back up it)  into  the  moat
and was happy to see the moat led to a cave under the snow  (formed  by  the
creek) and out the other end to once again snow free  gully.  The  cave  was
like entering a shower and was very spooky as parts  of  the  entrance  roof
had collapsed in big chunks. If a new chunk came down while I was  in  there
I was a goner. Fortunately none did.

Above the snow Gully 3 was easy again for a few hundred feet then  gradually
got steeper and steeper, and brushier. Actually the brush helped as I  could
use it for hand holds to pull myself up the  steep  dirt.  Then  I  hit  the
rocky headwall around 4100 ft. I wasn\'t quite sure where to go. I could  see
possible gullies to either side but neither looked good  to  me.  Instead  I
elected to go straight up the brushy middle between them where I had  secure
branches to hang on to. I again lost a lot of time wandering back and  forth
trying to find a way I could  bodily  pull  myself  up  the  cliff  on  tree
branches. I wore myself out almost to the total fatigue of  my  arm  muscles
on this section. The worse of it was probably not  more  than  100  vertical
feet and yet it took me over an hour. Eventually I pulled onto  flatter  and
less brushy ground above and left of a rocky rib at 4300 ft  and  thought  I
had it made. But this peak just wouldn\'t quit. After  several  hundred  feet
of steep but reasonable forest I hit what looked from a distance  to  be  an
easy dirt trough up through cliffs. However, when I got to it,  it  was  the
dreaded hardpack dirt again that gave zero purchase to  the  boot.  I  don\'t
know if conditions this year are unusual because it has been so dry and  the
dirt has turned to concrete hardness or if it is always  like  this,  but  I
can\'t remember when I have run into so much of this horrible stuff. It  took
me 2-3 times as long as it should have. Again I wished for snow.

I gratefully reached the summit ridge (5150 ft)  again  thinking  I  had  it
made. I was immediately dismayed to see this ridge was not the  gentle  open
crest I had envisioned from looking at the map but instead was a  series  of
rocky pinnacles guarded by dense twisted trees. With  all  the  time  I  had
lost with various problems it was now 2:50 and I  figured  I  had  at  least
another hour to the summit. I was really past a reasonable  turnaround  time
but no way was I going to give up now after  what  I  had  been  through.  I
resigned  myself  to  a  headlamp  return  and  doggedly   plunged   onward.
Fortunately, the ridge was not as bad as  it  first  appeared.  I  had  some
krumholz as I followed the crest but was able to find open ground with  good
footing on the left much of the way as I climbed  over  and  past  Pt  5202.
Beyond that easy terrain led down into the  basin  and  up  to  the  summit,
which I reached at 3:40 (4200 ft, 7:15  hrs),  actually  bettering  my  hour
estimate.

I found the summit register in a large waterproof pill bottle.  It  was  dry
and in good  shape.  It  had  been  placed  in  1992  by  The  Grays  Harbor
Olympians. The next ascent was  by  John  Roper  and  Silas  Wild  in  2001,
followed by Klenke in 2006, Shetter and Creeden in 2009  and  Andy  Boos  in
2010. I added my name for a total of 6 ascents in 21 years.  No,  this  peak
is not often climbed and of names  I  recognized  all  were  completing  the
P2000 list.

Despite the late hour, I took a half hour to enjoy my hard  won  views  into
the heart of the Olympics. Then I quickly headed down  not  looking  forward
one bit to the descent. I had several obstacles to overcome. The  first  was
the steep hardpack dirt trough off the summit ridge. This  was  even  harder
going down and I believe I did  my  first  ever  (deliberate)  sitting  dirt
glissade on the worse section. I actually used a cushion  of  forest  leaves
and debris to slide down on. It was really the safest way  as  I  could  not
stand upright without slipping. The second was the headwall. I  had  a  rope
but didn\'t think I could rappel the way I had come up as the trees were  too
thick. So I followed Shetter\'s down route staying on the rocky  rib  as  far
as possible (not bad going) until I  could  rappel  down  a  wall  and  then
tarzan down the rest of  the  way  hanging  onto  branches.  The  third  was
climbing back through the snow cave and up the dirt slope  out  of  Gully  3
and into Gully 2. I had to cut  steps  in  the  hard  dirt  to  get  up  it.
Although I did not have an ice ax I did have my Whippet  pole  ax  head  and
that worked (barely). From then on I had no  more  difficulties,  relatively
speaking. It was just a matter of picking my way slowly and  carefully  down
the talus. I hit Gully 1 at dusk (8:40)  and  put  on  my  headlamp  shortly
thereafter. I crossed  the  log  in  the  dark,  which  seemed  to  take  an
inordinately long time as it felt slightly uphill and my  arm  muscles  were
fried. I pulled into camp at 10:10 taking time  to  make  a  several  course
dinner and down multiple drinks before turning in at 11:30.

Day Total: 4.5 miles, 4600 ft and 13:45 hrs

Friday, August 23 - I slept in not leaving  until  9:45.  Shortly  down  the
trail I ran into a blind woman being led by  her  guide  dog.  She  and  her
husband were out for several days. Admittedly the  NF  trail  is  gentle  as
mountain trails go, but it has many rough, rocky sections and  tricky  creek
crossings. I can\'t imagine navigating it blind.  Her  challenges  were  much
greater than the ones I encountered. Just when I start feeling pleased  with
myself for what I have done, I meet someone who does me one better.

Day Total: 10 miles, 900 ft and 7 hrs

Trip Total: 24.5 miles and 7600 ft in 3 days

The Eagle Cap Wilderness is a unique and  scenic  area  of  scores  of  high
mountain lakes, meadows and lofty peaks and ridges located  in  the  Wallowa
Mountains of NE Oregon. It had been on my radar screen  for  years,  if  not
decades, but being a mostly Washington  peakbagger  I  had  never  made  the
effort to make the long drive. That is until Deb and Steve invited me  along
on their trip. Deb and her friend Sandra  had  made  a  couple  of  previous
trips and waxed poetic over its beauty which convinced me to finally  remedy
my omission. I am very glad I did. It did not disappoint.

Day 1: Friday, September 6 - Deb and Steve, along with Sandra and Dave,  had
driven to the TH the previous day and hiked in to a camp at Mirror Lake  (in
the Lakes Basin Management Area) early on this day. Not able to get away  on
Thursday, I made the long (7 hr) drive alone arriving  at  the  Two  Pan  TH
(elev 5600 ft) at 1:30 and starting on the trail at  2:00.  There  had  been
heavy rain the day before, which made hiking pleasant and cut down on  trail
dust, but was now sunny. After  2.5  miles  of  steady  climbing  the  trail
entered the gorgeous East Lostine River Valley  where  for  the  next  2  .5
miles I hiked in full view of Eagle  Cap  Peak.  After  another  2  miles  I
arrived at the junction to Mirror Lake where I followed a paper  note  trail
left by Deb directing me to their campsite (elev 7600 ft).  I  arrived  just
in time to enjoy having dinner with the group.

Day Total: 7.5 miles, 2100 ft and 5 hrs

Day 2: Saturday, September 7 - The entire  group  started  out  together  to
climb Eagle Cap and followed the trail to  the  summit  (2000  ft,  2  hrs).
Views were superb of the Lakes Basin and entire Wilderness area.  I  got  my
first real look at Matterhorn in the distance and was immediately  intrigued
by its distinctive white rock. At the time I had no idea what it  was.  Most
of the rock in the Lakes Basin was lovely granite which  provided  excellent
friction for climbing but that on the Matterhorn was obviously different.  I
knew I had to climb that peak to get a closer look.

From Eagle Cap we all descended the gentle south slope to the  ridge  saddle
where a convenient way trail  appeared  leading  down  toward  Glacier  Lake
which we followed until below cliffs and steep remnant snow. I  had  my  eye
on Glacier Peak above while the others headed for Prospect  Lake  below.  We
separated and I worked my way up interesting slabs on  a  leftward  traverse
past cliffs to the SE ridge. Here an easy but loose rock/dirt slope  led  to
the summit where I found a summit register filled with a wad of  unorganized
loose pages dating back to 1994 (2800 ft, 4:20 hrs).

After spending 30 minutes on  top  eating  lunch  I  started  down  and  had
descended a couple hundred feet when I spied Steve climbing rapidly  upward.
He had left the others at the saddle above Prospect Lake  and  followed  the
gentle east ridge up. I continued down this  delightful  crest.  Steve  soon
caught up to me after sprinting up to the summit and we  continued  together
to rendezvous with the rest of party at the Prospect saddle. From  there  we
all descended to beautiful Glacier Lake. We  made  a  stop  for  water  then
picked up the trail to Glacier Pass. I now had my eye on Pk 9020  above  the
pass. Steve, Deb and Sandra accompanied me to the first bump before  turning
around. I descended to a first notch and continued along  the  narrow  rocky
crest which became quite exposed in places. At a second notch I was  stymied
and had to backtrack to descend and then regain the ridge past the notch.  I
made it past a third notch even though it was somewhat sketchy and  then  on
to the summit at 4:45 (3900 ft, 8:30  hrs).  Oddly  I  found  two  ammo  box
registers on top, each placed by a member of  the  same  climbing  club  and
each with similar notebooks inside but each with a different  name  for  the
peak. They were placed within a week of each other in 1993. I would love  to
know the story behind this one.

From the summit I descended straight down the NW slope  avoiding  the  ridge
entirely and intersected the trail well  below  Glacier  Pass.  At  Moccasin
Lake I stopped to wash up as the last rays of sunshine left  the  basin  and
pulled into camp at 7:00, well after everyone else.

Day Total: 10 miles, 4200 ft and 10:45 hrs.

Day 3: Sunday, September 8  -  This  was  to  be  my  day  to  try  for  the
Matterhorn. The problem was we were really on the wrong  side  of  a  cliffy
ridge to climb it. It is  normally  approached  from  Ice  Lake.  Since  Deb
wanted to go to Razz Lake (she is more  into  lakes  than  peaks  but  I  am
working on converting her) I decided to accompany the group to  see  if  the
ridge could be crossed from there. I am glad I dd. We followed the trail  to
the Hurricane Creek junction, then past Crescent and Douglas Lakes  to  near
Horseshoe lake where we found an old abandoned trail that led  all  the  way
to Razz Lake. From there we went cross-country (some faint trails) to  upper
Razz Lake. This whole area of lakes and tarns  and  polished  granite  slabs
beneath pinnacled cliffs is unbelievable gorgeous.

From Upper Razz Lake Deb, Steve, Sandra and I made our way up an easy  talus
and dirt ramp that went diagonally beneath cliffs  to  a  small  notch  just
right of a spire that resembled a miniature Prusik Peak.  Here  I  left  the
others to descend a horrible loose rock/dirt gully to a  green  basin  below
in the Ice Lake drainage on the other side. This was one nasty gully,  about
as  steep  as  it  could  possibly  be  without  having  the   whole   thing
spontaneously respond to the pull of gravity. In fact much of it  did  as  I
carefully picked my way down constantly questioning the wisdom of doing  so.
The top couple hundred feet were the  worst.  After  a  total  of  800  feet
descent I reached the blessed green basin and from then on the rest  of  the
route was a delight of lush meadows, rock gardens and bubbling creeks.

After about 1000 feet of this pleasant travel I crossed  a  spur  ridge  and
dropped slightly to climb another  spur  to  a  large  flat  barren  plateau
beneath the pure white cliffs of Matterhorn. I had to  blink  several  times
to convince myself these cliffs were rock as at first glance  I  would  have
sworn they were ice. A dark ridge led up  from  the  plateau  to  the  white
rounded summit mass that to me resembled a white whale.  In  the  background
Hurwal Divide loomed almost black. This  contrast  of  light  and  dark  was
positively stunning. I have never seen anything  like  it  before.  I  later
found out that the white rock is limestone and the dark is  volcanic  but  I
need to research more about the fascinating geology of these  mountains.  To
add icing on the cake, as I crossed the plateau I  spied  2  white  mountain
goats silhouetted against the black of Hurwal Divide.

I crossed the plateau to the dark ridge  where  I  ran  into  the  climber\'s
trail coming from Ice Lake. This led to the "White Whale",  along  the  back
of the whale, down to a notch and up to the summit at the  far  end  of  the
ridge. There was "trail" the whole way but at times it traversed across  the
side of the "whale" on sketchy ledges to avoid  steep  slabs.  These  ledges
were often narrow and covered  with  ball  bearing  sand  and  I  discovered
limestone does not have as good a friction as granite so care was needed  to
avoid slipping, especially if a section  of  obscure  trail  was  missed.  I
reached the summit at 3:45 (3600 ft, 7:15 hrs). There was  no  register  but
there was an artistic cairn. I spent as much time on top as I dared  knowing
I had a long way to go to get out, but I couldn\'t help  standing  in  awe  a
few minutes at the view along the ridge to Sacajawea (the  highest  peak  in
the Wallowas at 9838 ft)  with  more  of  the  same  contrasting  darks  and
lights.

Reluctantly I started down at 4:00. My plan was  to  descend  directly  into
Hurricane Creek. No way was I going to return the way I  had  come  up  that
horrid gully. However  the  ridge  above  Hurricane  Creek  was  cliffy  and
impassible for quite a distance and I had to retrace my steps  all  the  way
back to the first spur before I could find a reasonable way  over  it.  From
the basin below this spur I had to climb 500 feet up a  scree  slope,  loose
but infinitely better than the horrid gully, to a broad 9000  ft  saddle  in
the main ridge which I reached at 5:30. From the  saddle  I  worked  my  way
down 2000 ft to Hurricane Creek. I had scoped  this  route  out  from  Lakes
Basin and it looked feasible but there were some cliffs enroute.  I  managed
to avoid most of them by zigzagging back and forth but failed in  one  small
area at two small 10 foot drops I could find  no  way  around.  I  rappelled
these with my small "panic" rope (which I am never without). That slowed  me
up such that it took 1.5 hours to hit the trail in the valley  bottom.  From
there it was about 2.5 miles and 500 ft of uphill to the junction  with  the
Lakes Basin trail which I reached at 8:00. The last bit was by headlamp  and
I pulled into camp at 8:30 much to the relief of both myself and my  waiting
friends.

Day Total: 12 miles, 5100 ft and 12 hrs

Day 4: Sunday, September 9 -  We  spent  a  leisurely  day  climbing  scenic
mellow Peak 8441 right above camp (800 ft, 1:00 hr). We  lounged  around  on
top for 2 hours taking in the views before  returning  to  camp  for  lunch,
packing up and moving camp down to the far end  of  the  Lostine  Valley  (2
hrs).

Day Total: 7 miles and 900 ft

Day 5: Monday, September 10 - We hiked the short remaining distance  to  the
TH reaching it at 9:00. During the long drive  home  I  had  ample  time  to
reflect on the trip. I found The Eagle Cap Wilderness to be a  very  special
experience well worth the long drive and vowed to  return  soon.  Thank  you
Deb and Steve for introducing it to me.

Day Total: 2.5 miles, 1:15 hr

Trip Total: 39 miles and 12,300 ft in 4.5 days.

Nook Mtn (6760+ ft - P960 - Mt Sefrit Quad) and Sackout Mtn (6596 ft -  P516
- Mt Shuksan Quad) - October 8-10, 2013

These 2 peaks could probably be climbed in day from  the  Hannegan  Pass  TH
during spring daylight and snow conditions, but I didn\'t think  I  would  be
able to do so this time of year and allowed more time. Good thing I  did.  I
expected maybe 2 feet of new snow from recent storms,  but  was  shocked  to
find it almost twice as much as that at higher elevations. There were  times
I could barely move it was so  deep.  In  retrospect  I  should  have  taken
snowshoes, but I really didn\'t think it would  be  so  bad  and  anyone  who
knows me knows I hate snowshoes and will go  to  great  lengths  and  endure
great suffering to avoid using them. Well,  I  certainly  suffered  on  this
trip.

Tuesday, October 8 - The forecast was not  good  for  the  morning  but  did
indicate clearing later in the day. With this in  mind  and  since  my  only
goal was to hike the 3.5 miles to Hannegan  Camp,  I  didn\'t  start  on  the
trail until 3:00. My strategy worked. I did begin in light rain/snow but  it
soon cleared to sunshine. The trail was completely  snow  free  until  about
4500 ft. After encountering only small patches thereafter I was confident  I
would find a snow free spot to camp. However, when I came  to  the  Hannegan
Camp junction it was like a switch had been flipped  and  all  of  a  sudden
there was a solid foot of snow covering everything.  I  couldn\'t  even  find
the established campsites. I wandered around for 30 minutes before  I  found
a bare spot next to the trail a short ways up  from  the  junction.   I  had
remembered this spot from my previous recent visits. It would do nicely.

Day Total: 3.5 miles, 1700 ft and 2:30 hrs

Wednesday, October 9 - It was cold  enough  during  the  night  for  a  mild
freeze which formed a light crust on snow that had been exposed to the  sun.
My first objective was Sackout Mtn and to access it I had to first get  into
Ruth Creek Basin below it. I tried contouring from camp into the  basin  but
soon gave that up on the steep densely treed slope  and  ended  up  dropping
500 feet directly to the creek. Once there it was straightforward  but  slow
going on snow-covered rocks. At the head of the basin I veered right into  a
gully that led to an upper basin below a headwall. To bypass the  cliffs  of
this headwall I went right onto a wooded rib. Once above  the  headwall  the
terrain opened up and was  easy  but  the  snow  was  getting  progressively
deeper while I was getting progressively slower. Often my poles  (which  did
not have ski baskets on them) would sink in all the  way  to  their  handles
and on steeper sections I would kick a step only to have it  collapse  as  I
weighted it leaving me in a hip deep hole and struggling to get out. It  was
very slow going indeed. Oh but it was so beautiful with  all  the  new  snow
and gorgeous views it made it all worthwhile.

Eventually I worked my way to the base of the  summit  rocks.  I  could  see
only one possible route up.  It looked darn steep and it  was.  Actually  it
wouldn\'t have been that bad had  the  snow  been  better  but  it  was  deep
unconsolidated stuff loosely plastered over the rock and not to be  trusted.
My biggest fear was a step would give way or collapse into a hole  alongside
the rock. I carefully built steps up by first using my  axe  to  remove  the
top 6-12 inches of loose snow to allow me to kick or cut  a  step  into  the
soft crust underneath. Then I would carefully compact the snow with my  foot
before trusting my weight to it. I doubt the bad part was more 100  vertical
feet but it took about an hour of  total  focus  to  surmount.  Once  I  had
committed to it the only thing that kept  me  going  was  that  I  was  more
afraid to go down than to continue up.

I reached the summit of Sackout Mtn at  2:50  (2400  ft,  6:20  hrs)  having
taken way more time than expected. I still wanted  to  climb  Nook  Mtn.  It
didn\'t look that far or  that  hard  but  if  I  had  the  same  awful  snow
conditions  it  could  take  a  very  long  time,  time  I  no  longer  had.
Fortunately, conditions were much better as I  was  now  following  a  ridge
which was windblown crust. I was able to run down to the Nook saddle  in  20
minutes. The snow depth increased a little as I climbed up from  the  saddle
but it was still not bad, only ankle to calf deep at  worst.  The  only  bad
part on the ridge was when I had to traverse out onto a steep  exposed  snow
slope to bypass a short rock  step.  The  rest  was  straightforward  and  I
reached the summit of Nook at 4:45 (3200 ft, 8:15 hr).

Now I had to get down. I knew from previous views that I could  not  descend
directly from the Nook saddle, which led to a nasty  gully  and  cliffs.  So
instead I dropped down the north ridge until past cliffs and then  traversed
back to the east toward Ruth Creek basin. This  went  well  for  about  1000
feet until I hit increasingly deep  soft  snow  where  every  other  step  I
seemed to break through into holes. Some were as deep as my  waist.  It  was
maddeningly frustrating. I did a lot  of  floundering  and  cursing.  If  it
weren\'t for the fact that I was going downhill I don\'t think  I  would  have
been able to make any progress  at  all.  When  I  could  I  did  a  sitting
glissade but the snow was really too soft to do much sliding.  Eventually  I
made it through this awful section.

At about 4900 ft I came to a deep gully on my right. I really wanted  to  be
on the other side but I could not easily cross and so  was  forced  straight
downhill on the left through dense small trees. This wouldn\'t have  been  so
bad except the branches were all wet. I couldn\'t understand why as  the  day
had been mostly sunny. I guess the fresh snow of  yesterday  had  melted  on
the branches. So between this and wallowing in the upper deep snow,  by  the
time I hit Ruth Creek (some 200 feet  lower  than  on  the  way  up)  I  was
soaking wet. I warmed up and dried out a bit on the 700 ft climb back up  to
camp, which I did by headlamp, arriving at 8:20.

Day Total: 4.5 miles, 3900 ft and 11:50 hrs

Thursday, October 10 - I fully expected to wake up to rain as that had  been
the forecast. I did not. I was not, however, spared  the  unpleasantness  of
packing up a wet tent, due to a combination of dripping trees,  condensation
and just general dampness.  I took my time ambling  out  enjoying  the  fall
color along the lower trail.

Day Total: 3.5 miles, 100 ft and 2:10 hrs

Trip Total: 11.5 miles and 5700 ft in 1 full day, 2 half days and 2 nights

"Pomas Peak" (7320+ ft - P840 - Saska Pk Quad) - October 16-17, 2013

The main purpose of this trip was to visit the golden larches by camping  at
appropriately named Larch Lakes. Coincidently there was a new  peak  for  me
to climb nearby. It has no official name but I  am  calling  it  Pomas  Peak
since it rises directly above Pomas Pass.

Wednesday, October 16 - I started up the Entiat River Trail  at  11:00.  The
first part of the trail along the river is open to motorcycles and  as  such
is smooth and easy hiking. Since it was hunting season, I ran  into  several
of the machines and one horseman leading a pack animal, but  all  were  very
friendly and courteous. Several of the motorcycle riders  not  only  yielded
to me but turned off their engines until I passed. Their  consideration  was
greatly appreciated. Once I turned off the main trail onto the  Myrtle  Lake
Trail I met no one. This route allows use of  the  bridge  over  the  Entiat
River and avoids the ford higher up. I was fascinated by  a  tree  that  had
fallen onto and penetrated the bridge deck. Fortunately it  seemed  to  have
done no major structural damage but it was very impressive.

From the lake I picked up the hiker-only trail that connects  to  the  Larch
Lakes Trail. I ran into the first snow just before the Lower Lake  at  about
5500 ft. As expected, the snow increased rapidly as soon as  I  entered  the
lake basin (5650 ft) and in the open meadow was over  a  foot  deep.  Others
had been this way recently and there was a packed trail to  the  Upper  Lake
(5750 ft) which had even more snow. I fully expected to  camp  on  snow  but
was delighted when I found a snow free established  campsite  right  on  the
lake. I arrived at 4:30, quite early  by  my  standards,  but  the  sun  had
already set behind the ridge and the day, which had  been  sunny  and  warm,
quickly cooled off.

Day Total: 7.6 mile, 2900 ft and 5:30 hrs

Thursday, October 17 - I woke up at 6:30.  Since  I  had  gone  to  bed  the
previous night at 7:30 that meant I had slept 11 hours, and they were  solid
hours. Good grief, I never sleep that long at home. I  sure  sleep  well  in
the mountains. Of course it helped that I had switched to my winter bag  and
was toasty warm all night.  But it was darn cold to start and  the  water  I
left outside had a thick layer of ice. I managed to get going  by  8:15  and
followed the Pomas Pass Trail. No one had been beyond the lake and the  only
tracks were those made by deer. The snow  had  frozen  hard  enough  that  I
didn\'t break through the crust and I made rapid  progress  to  the  6440  ft
pass in the ridge above. On the other side the trail traversed  slopes  that
were steep enough crampons would have been useful  but  I  had  not  brought
them. I was, however, happy to have brought an axe.

Once below my peak I climbed up to the ridge and then  along  the  crest  to
the top. I found a cairn on top and thought I was on the high point until  I
saw another point to the north that looked higher. Darn!  It  was  not  that
easy to get to as the intervening ridge was narrow and rocky and it took  an
additional 30 minutes. I had to descend  below  the  cliffs  until  I  could
traverse on steep snow. Once below the  North  Peak  it  was  then  an  easy
ascent. I also found a cairn on this summit. On the map  each  point  has  a
7320 ft contour but I am convinced the North Peak is higher than  the  South
Peak by 10-15 feet. My altimeter and my eye (which admittedly  is  not  that
reliable) both confirm this. Anyway I left my register  on  the  North  Peak
which I reached at 10:45 (1700 ft, 2:30 hrs).

I left the North Peak at 11:00 carefully reversing  the  traverse  to  below
the South Peak.  Once past the 6440 ft pass, the sun  had  begun  to  soften
the snow and I bogged down in a few places. I reached camp at 12:30. I  then
enjoyed 1.5 hours of basking in the sunshine before  leaving  for  the  trek
out. Again I met no one until regaining the main Entiat River  Trail,  where
I ran into several hunters and one couple who had climbed Pinnacle  Peak  on
a multiday trip.  Oddly, despite all the hunters I  heard  not  one  gunshot
and my tranquility was undisturbed. In fact the whole trip was a delight.

Pomas Peak: 3.6 miles, 1700 ft and 4:15 hrs RT from camp

Hike out: 7.6 miles, 300 ft and 4:10 hrs

Trip Total: 18.8 miles and 4900 ft in 2 days

Whalehead Ridge (5280+ ft - P720 - Purcell Mtn Quad) - November 1, 2013

Whalehead Ridge is an impressive looking rocky highlight in a  small  alpine
oasis rising above a maze of logging roads north of Randle.  I  first  tried
Whalehead Ridge on April 2, 2013 via  the  route  Klenke  describes  in  his
October   2006    ascent    (http://www.summitpost.org/whalesback-southeast-
ridge/239599).  I didn\'t get very far up the actual peak but I  did  have  a
nice ski trip to the saddle below the SE Ridge. I concluded  his  route  was
too difficult for me to climb solo (he described  a  Class  5.3  pitch  just
below the summit) and my only possible  alternative  would  be  an  approach
from the opposite direction via the NW Ridge.  And so I returned some  seven
months later to hopefully complete this unfinished business.

The hard part was finding a way onto the NW Ridge. Maps show  logging  roads
climbing high onto the slopes north and west of Whalehead but in fact  these
are for the most part undrivable and barely  hikeable.  I  got  as  close  I
could by driving FR 52 to FR 47 (note that FR 47 can  no  longer  be  driven
directly from Randle due to a  permanent  washout  near  the  East  Fork  of
Silver Creek) to FR 63 to FR 6353. This last spur can be  driven  1.3  miles
to a washout but it is quite overgrown. There is an  ample  turnaround  here
and a nice spot to park. I continued on foot. The  road  immediately  became
so overgrown with alder as to be almost impenetrable.  I  persevered  for  a
very unpleasant 0.75 mile until I couldn\'t take it anymore and figured  it  was
safe to head straight uphill. Once off the road travel improved. I  did  hit
one short bad brush section but I was able to avoid it on the  way  down.  I
crossed the switch backing road several times but continued to ignore it  as
it was of no use. Just below the ridge I  came  to  a  welcome  open  meadow
slope which I climbed to the crest very near Pt 5178 (1700 ft, 2 hrs).

Now the real fun began. I got a good view of Whalehead summit and it  looked
formidable. It appeared my best bet would be  to  stay  high  on  the  ridge
crest above all the nasty steep slabs and side hill. However, I could see  a
notch just before the summit pyramid and I was not sure how  difficult  that
would be to cross. The ridge was partially  wooded  and  easy  up  and  down
until just below Pt 5183 where a steep,  somewhat  unpleasant  traverse  was
necessary to bypass that pinnacle. Once  past,  I  regained  the  delightful
open ridge. I was now near the notch I had  seen  from  afar  and  was  very
happy to discover it to not be a problem at all, just a short class  3  step
down. More of a problem were the thick trees to  wrestle  through  right  at
the notch itself. Then it was steep mossy rock the rest of the  way  to  the
summit (2300 ft. 3:20 hrs). I found a cairn but no summit register.  I  also
found a white sling attached to a rather wimpy  looking  root  a  short  way
down the SE Ridge. I assumed this was the rappel anchor used by  Klenke  but
in rereading his report he said it was black. Either it  had  faded  greatly
in 7 years or someone else had added a new sling.

Since I had run into many fewer problems  and  taken  much  less  time  than
expected, I was able to enjoy my summit views for  40 minutes on what  would
turn out to be the last sunny, snow free day high up before bad weather  set
in for good. I even made it back to the car before dark. Although I did  not
like that alder choked road walk, the rest of the  trip  turned  out  to  be
downright enjoyable.

Total: 4.5 miles, 2700 ft and 6:30 hrs

Lizard Head Peak (5350+ ft - P600) and Pk 5150+  (P450)  -  Lake  Sutherland
Quad - November 8-10, 2013

Aurora Ridge is the  long  divide  between  the  Lyre  (Lake  Crescent)  and
Soleduck Rivers. The east  end  blends  into  Happy  Lake  Ridge  where  the
distinction between the two  is  indefinite.  There  are  several  peaks  of
prominence and name along this length. I planned to climb two of  them  that
could be accessed from the Barnes Creek and Aurora Divide Trails.  The  last
time I had tried to hike the Barnes Creek Trail, many years ago,  the  trail
appeared to have little maintenance and the bridge was out.  So  I  was  not
sure what I would run into or how far I would get this time  around.  I  was
surprised to find a well maintained trail  in  excellent  condition  with  a
very nice log crossing in place. This lowland trail is now a  lovely  forest
hike that is accessible most of the year.

Friday, November 8 - I began from the Storm King Ranger  Station  (elev  600
ft), which is also the TH for Marymere Falls and Storm  King,  both  popular
destinations. At .5 miles the Barnes Creek Trail left the wide path  heading
for the falls to become a delightful narrow but  good  tread  that  followed
alongside the creek. Soon it crossed to the  other  side  and  commenced  to
wander up and down through beautiful mossy forest.  After  climbing  several
hundred feet in a series of switchbacks, it came to Dismal Draw and a  small
campsite. Though I love this name, Dismal Draw is not all  that  dismal  and
made for a pleasant rest stop.  Shortly beyond there was a brief glimpse  of
cliffy Storm King across the valley and then the trail divided at a 2000  ft
junction (4 miles, 1700  ft,  3  hrs).  The  Barnes  Creek  Trail  continued
straight ahead staying low in the valley while I went right  on  the  Aurora
Divide Trail that climbed steadily alongside an unnamed  side  creek  toward
Aurora Ridge. At about 3700 I began running into fresh  snow  which  quickly
increased in depth. At 4250 feet  I  found  the  only  campsite  along  this
section of trail. Although there was consistent snow at  this  elevation  in
the open, the spot was protected enough under trees that with a little  work
I was able to pitch my tent on bare ground. A little stream nearby  provided
water. It was quite a nice camp.

Day Total: 7 miles, 4050 ft and 5:15 hrs.

Saturday, November 9 - After a long but comfortable night, I was on  my  way
at 9:00 continuing up the trail to the divide saddle at 4700 ft. From  there
I followed the ridge to the summit of Pk 5150. It was not as easy  going  as
the map might indicate, there being many  downed  trees  and  much  annoying
debris to work through and around and it took  longer  than  expected  (1000
ft, 1:30 hrs). Note that the Aurora Ridge Trail does NOT go over the top  as
is shown on both the USGS Lake Sutherland and GT  Lake  Crescent  maps.  The
Custom Correct Lake Crescent-Happy Lake Ridge map correctly shows the  trail
contouring about 400 feet below the summit.

I returned to the saddle and the  nearby  trail  junction  with  the  Aurora
Ridge Trail (which is not right at the saddle) to  continue  on  this  trail
toward Lizard Head Pk. Snow depth in the open was now about 1 foot but  only
a few inches in the trees and the trail was easily  followed  and  no  great
chore. At a likely looking spot I left the trail to gain the east  ridge  of
the peak. Again this ridge was  more  difficult  than  expected  with  tight
trees  and  hidden  small  outcrops  requiring  steep  bypass  traverses  in
deepening fresh snow. I reached the snowy summit cairn atop a small  boulder
tucked in amongst trees at  1:20  (1950  ft,  4:20  hrs).  The  morning  had
started with good visibility and I had a few reasonable  views  enroute  but
it was now snowing very lightly and continued to do so the rest of the  day.
Even so I spent over 30 minutes on top placing a register and  eating  lunch
as there was no wind and it was not that cold.

It was too early to return to camp. I wanted to minimize time spent  in  the
tent as much as possible, so once on the trail again I  continued  along  it
to the Happy Lake Trail Junction and then even farther to the high point  of
Crystal Ridge. Since the trail was easy to follow I  figured  I  could  keep
going until dark and then return by headlamp with no  problem.  This  I  did
and also made a slight detour on the way back to  pick  up  Pk  5175  (P300)
although I must admit it was not worth the effort.  I  don\'t  think  I  have
ever run into such  thick  summit  trees.  They  were  almost  impenetrable,
requiring crawling under, slithering over and  other  major  contortions  to
force a way through. But it did eat up more  time  away  from  the  sleeping
bag. I was back in camp at 7:30 having done justice to the day.

Day Total: 9 miles, 3200 ft and 10:30 hrs

Sunday, November 10 - I enjoyed a leisurely trip  out  taking  my  time  and
enjoying the truly beautiful green forest again once out of the  snow  zone.
I was tempted to explore the continuation of the Barnes  Creek  Trail  which
looked very inviting beyond the junction with the Aurora  Divide  Trail  but
decided to save that for another day. I fully  expected  some  precipitation
going out but had none. In fact I essentially  had  none  the  entire  trip,
other than the light snow on Saturday afternoon which  got  nothing  wet.  I
never even had to use my rain  gear.  Pretty  darn  good  I  would  say  for
November in the Olympics.

Day Total: 7 miles, 350 ft and 4:30 hrs

Trip Total: 23 miles and 7600 ft in 3 days

Tirzah Pk (5208 ft - P128 - Mowich Lk Quad) - November 14, 2013

The new guide to 100 peaks in Mt Rainier had me looking at what I  had  left
to do to complete this list. Not that many it turns out (7), this being  one
of them. So off I went all prepared to climb it via  the  usual  route  from
the Chenuis Falls Trail. I even took a bike along for the 4 miles along  the
closed Carbon River Road to the TH. Then  I  stopped  at  the  "new"  Carbon
River Ranger Station 2.5  miles  before  the  park  entrance,  which  I  was
surprised to find open on a Thursday in November, and  the  ranger  informed
me that the bridge over the Carbon River had washed out about 2 months  ago.
Why did the Longmire Ranger Station not know this when I  called  them  just
before my trip (they said they had no information)?  So it was  on  to  Plan
B.

I drove up Cayada Creek Road 7810 about 3.5  miles  to  a  side  road  right
(this is at the same junction for the  Jeep  road  that  goes  left  to  Old
Baldy) and was able to drive it .3 miles to the first ditch. This  old  road
(7840) contours the hillside below Cayada Mtn above  the  Carbon  River  and
into the Chenuis Cr drainage and I thought it could be used as a way to  get
close enough to Tirzah to climb it. I started on my bike,  since  I  had  it
along anyway, but there were so many ditches that it was more  trouble  than
it was worth and I gave up after 1.5 miles to continue  on  foot.  The  road
became more and more overgrown but is  very  walkable.  After  another  half
mile I left the road to plunge downhill an unpleasant brushy 400 feet  to  a
crossing of Chenuis Creek. The creek was flowing higher than  expected  with
no easy way across. I tried to hop rocks but slipped and  ended  up  getting
both feet wet. Not good, but I decided to continue anyway despite  squishing
in my boots the rest of the day.

The other side of the creek was less  brushy  and  I  soon  intersected  the
trail from Chenuis Falls. It was so nice to be on good tread I  stayed  with
it as long as it went uphill, maybe .4 miles. This put me on the north  side
of the peak away from the normal route but although steep  the  forest  here
(now inside the park) was not bad travel to the ridge.  Once  on  the  ridge
things got  interesting  as  it  has  many  rocky  outcroppings.  None  were
difficult to get past, first on the left then on the right, then  along  the
crest but the whole ridge, though enjoyable scrambling, seemed  much  longer
than it appeared on the map and seemed to  take  forever.  All  day  it  had
never really rained much, just mist and drizzle,  but  near  the  summit  it
turned to light snow that began to stick. The summit (2700 ft, 5 hrs) was  a
small opening in the trees. I was surprised to find no  cairn  much  less  a
register, which I spent the next 30 minutes remedying (and eating lunch).

The ridge was somewhat confusing on the descent  and  GPS  waypoints  helped
keep me on track. Once back to the crossing of Chenuis Creek I  didn\'t  even
try to stay dry and just waded across  without  stopping.  It  was  over  my
knees. The climb back to the road was very unpleasant and sure  seemed  more
than 400 ft. And I can\'t remember the last time I hiked in wet boots for  so
long. Still, overall I was pleased to have  made  my  route  work.  I  doubt
anyone else has ever gone this way to climb Tirzah Pk.

Total: 8 miles, 3400 ft and 10 hours

Sweet Pk (4560+ ft - P200 - Golden Lakes Quad) - November 19, 2013

Each year I try to go on a  special  birthday  climb  with  my  son  Walter.
Despite having the misfortune to be born in  November,  arguably  the  worst
month for weather  or  quality  destinations,  we  usually  manage  to  find
something to do and always have fun, rain  or  shine.  This  year,  with  my
renewed interest in cleaning up the few peaks in  Mt  Rainier  that  I  have
missed, we settled on Sweet Pk, which can be accessed from the Carbon  River
entrance of the Park. His birthday on Tuesday was  a  transition  day  after
heavy rain on Monday and before sun on Wednesday. Although we  had  none  of
the latter neither did we have any significant precipitation which was  more
than we had hoped for. Many of his birthday trips have  been  in  torrential
rain or heavy snow.

We began on the West Boundary trail  which  branches  off  the  Rain  Forest
Nature Trail loop right at the Park entrance (1750  ft).  The  last  time  I
took this trail (many years ago to climb Florence Pk)  I  remembered  it  as
being rough and seldom maintained. No more.  The  first  1.5  miles  to  two
waterfalls has had major work done to it  and  is  in  excellent  shape  and
traverses lovely forest.  The  trail  crosses  the  creek  between  the  two
waterfalls. Ordinarily I doubt this crossing would cause much of a  problem,
but due to heavy rain the day and night before, it was  running  very  high.
We barely made it across with dry feet. The trail was noticeably rougher  on
the other side yet not that bad except  for  the  sections  that  still  had
running water left over from the recent downpour. At 3650, where  the  trail
veers away from the creek toward Alki Crest, we left it and headed  for  the
south ridge of Sweet Pk, which we hit very near  the  saddle.  We  ran  into
minor crusty snow here. It was then an easy ridge walk to the  summit  (3:15
hrs).

As the day progressed  we  could  feel  the  temperature  dropping.  It  was
snowing lightly on top with a cold wind so  we  retreated  to  the  relative
warmth of my bothy bag for our lunch and birthday party which  included  one
candle in a cookie.  After  festivities  we  built  a  cairn  and  placed  a
register before leaving. We both liked the name of this peak and agree  that
this was a very pleasant trip. But then any trip with my son is a delight.

Total: 7 miles, 3000 ft and 5:30 hours

Baldy Ridge (5050+ ft - P1400 - Lake  Sutherland  Quad)  -  November  21-23,
2013

When I hiked up the Barnes Creek Trail two weeks ago and turned  off  it  at
mile 4 onto  the  Aurora  Divide  Trail  to  climb  Lizard  Head  Peak,  the
continuation of the trail appeared so inviting  I vowed to return  and  hike
it to its end. I didn\'t know at that time I would return so soon.  But  with
unusual stable high pressure continuing, I was lured back for another  three
day trip. This time I hoped to gain access to Baldy Ridge from  the  end  of
the trail. I was a little concerned  with  forecast  nighttime  temperatures
into the low twenties and icy trail condition but they turned out to not  be
a problem. I  actually  had  warmer  temperatures,  once  above  the  valley
bottom, than I did for my Lizard Head trip.

Thursday, November 21 - I almost postponed this trip when I saw the  traffic
cam on Highway  101  at  Indian  Valley  showing  several  inches  of  white
alongside the road. How on earth could there be snow  at  600  ft?  If  that
were the case, my trip was in jeopardy.  I  was  somewhat  relieved  when  I
discovered in person  this  white  stuff  was  heavy  frost  and  not  snow.
Evidently Indian Valley is a sink hole of cold air next to a big  source  of
moisture where the sun never shines and is very conducive to forming  frost.
Even so the temperature was frigid and still so a few miles farther  at  the
Storm King Ranger Station (elev 600 ft) when I started out. It remained  icy
until the trail climbed above the valley. I was glad I had thought to  bring
microspikes for crossing the 3 slick bridges. Higher up the trail was  frost
free though the ground was still frozen in places.

Once past the Aurora Divide Trail junction  I  was  on  new  territory.  The
trail was noticeably less used now but still in very good  condition.  I  am
extremely pleased to  see  some  these  previously  abandoned  trails  being
resurrected. I am not sure when this  happened  but  it  had  to  have  been
logged out after the Third Edition (2000) of  Robert  Wood\'s  Olympic  Trail
Guide as he describes the Barnes Creek trail in that  book  as  unmaintained
and essentially abandoned after the junction. I continued a very pleasant  3
more miles, winding in and out of several  side  valleys  through  beautiful
forest, to a nice campsite (mentioned by Wood) just  past  the  crossing  of
Happy Lake Creek (elev 2700).

Total: 7 miles, 2600 ft and 4:40 hrs

Friday, November 22 - It barely got  to  below  freezing  during  the  night
outside and was a balmy 37 inside my 4 season tent. I was  almost  too  warm
in my winter bag. Being in dense forest on the shady side of  the  hill,  my
camp saw little early light and I was shocked when it was already 7:45  when
I woke up. No alpine start today. I  continued  along  the  trail  which  in
places was a solid carpet of moss signaling little use. After  2.5  miles  I
came to a junction. The right branch went a very short distance  to  an  end
at a saddle on the wooded ridge crest. The left went a bit farther  climbing
to a viewpoint known as Lookout Dome, elev 3800 ft.  It  is  interesting  to
note that the USGS Lake Sutherland Quad does not  show  this  trail  in  the
correct location. It shows it climbing from low in the  valley  directly  to
Baldy  Ridge,  which  it  doesn\'t  come  close  to  doing.  This  is  rather
reminiscent of the depiction of a trail all the way  to  the  summit  of  Mt
Storm King, which also does not exist. GT does not show  the  trail  at  all
even though it often shows  worse  trails.  And  even  Wood  has  the  trail
splitting at 4800 feet and ending at 5090 ft on  Lookout  Dome  (he  has  no
detailed maps). He is off on his elevations by 1000  feet  which  caused  me
great confusion in trying to figure out exactly where the trail  went  while
planning my trip. He also said the trail ended  at  the  park  boundary  (it
does not) adding more confusion. The only  map  showing  the  trail  in  the
correct location is the Custom Correct Lake Crescent-Happy Lake Ridge one.

So I now found myself on Lookout Dome and could see major cliffs between  me
and my objective of Baldy Ridge with no assurance I  could  get  there  from
here. Not really where I wanted to be. Still, I make it  work.  I  continued
along the ridge, which went well at first, until coming upon a  cliff  wall.
I turned this on the left going through a critical notch that I  fortunately
marked with a cairn. That would be very useful on the  way  back.  From  the
notch I traversed on the left slope, gained the ridge again,  dropped  to  a
saddle and came to another wall. I could not see  a  way  through  this  one
without dropping a couple hundred feet farther on the left until  below  it.
From that point on it was easy forest and talus to the summit  ridge.  There
are two closed 5050 ft contours along the ridge and I am not sure  which  is
higher so I visited both. My guess is the East  summit  is  higher  but  the
West summit is more open and I ate my lunch there (3200 ft, 5 hrs).

I left the East summit at 3:45. I thought I could  make  a  direct  traverse
from the low point of the cliff wall  to  avoid  climbing  back  up  to  the
ridge. Bad idea. I ran into a wicked gully I couldn\'t cross.  I  would  have
had to descend several hundred more feet with no certainty even then that  I
could make it go. So I climbed straight up very steep terrain trying to  get
back to the critical notch. I had it marked with a waypoint but the  terrain
was so steep and rugged even when it showed I was within 50 feet I  couldn\'t
readily find it and nothing looked familiar. Of, course by now it was  dark.
If it hadn\'t been for the cairn I placed I am not sure  I  would  have  ever
recognized it. It was not obvious.

I had a few more moments of confusion working my way down  from  the  notch,
then it was easy along the ridge to Lookout Dome  to  intersect  the  trail.
The remainder was pleasant as I  do  enjoy  hiking  a  trail  in  the  dark,
especially when the alternative is more hours  than  I  would  like  in  the
sleeping bag. I reached camp at 8:00.

Total: 7.5 miles, 3850 ft and 10:30 hrs

Saturday, November 23 - It was even warmer in the tent this morning  at  41.
I did get up earlier than the previous day but hung around camp  for  a  few
hours before leaving at 9:30. As I was taking a rest  break  at  the  Aurora
Divide Trail junction I met an enthusiastic young man coming up on  his  way
to climb Lizard Head. He is the only person  I  met  on  both  my  trips  up
Barnes Creek. On chatting with him for a while I realized  I  had  read  his
Storm King attempt posted on NWhikers in July, which gave me a few  pointers
for my ascent. Small world! I found out later that he did make it up  Lizard
Head. Oddly, I entered the frost zone as I descended from the  junction  and
again I appreciated the microspikes to cross the icy bridges. I reached  the
car at 1:30 and even at that hour Indian Valley along Highway 101 was  still
below freezing and all white with frost.

Day Total: 7 miles, 600 ft and 4 hrs

Trip Total: 21.5 miles and 7050 ft in 3 days

Anderson Butte (3400+ ft - P960 - Wynoochee  Lk  Quad)  and  Anderson  Butte
Lookout (3358 ft) - December 11, 2013

I must confess this is my second trip up  Anderson  Butte  in  less  than  a
week. I must also admit that the actual summit is not worth a repeat  visit.
So why return, you may ask? Because somehow  during  my  first  trip  I  had
failed to locate the nearby lookout site which  I  really  wanted  to  find.
But let me start at the beginning.

Anderson  Butte,  though  of  low  elevation,  rises   steeply   above   the
bottomlands between the Wynoochee and West Fork Satsop Rivers. I  have  long
been intrigued by a 1952 photo of the Anderson Butte Lookout in  Spring  and
Fish\'s Lookouts book (1996). It shows a cabin perched atop a rocky  pinnacle
reached by a trail, with a cable handrail, blasted  into  the  summit  rock.
The cabin was built in the 1930s and removed in 1968.  It  was  reported  to
have fine views of the southern Olympics. A trail formerly climbed from  the
valley up Anderson Creek but has since been obliterated by  logging.  Wood\'s
Olympic Trail Guide describes a remnant of the old trail, as of 2000,  still
accessible from Road 2372-040. The only problem was  neither  book  gave  an
exact location for the lookout and, silly me, I just assumed it was  on  the
highest summit. It was not.

So on Friday, December 6 I set out to climb  Anderson  Butte  thinking  this
would also include the lookout site. I was  not  naÃ¯ve  enough  to  think  I
would still be able to drive the logging road up the south  side.  Expecting
the worst, I didn\'t even try to drive it,  parked near its obscure  junction
with Rd 2372 and started walking. The road was actually  drivable  about  .2
mile to a washout where a steep switchback continued  up  and  left.  Hoping
this might be a way around the washout I followed  it,  but  it  soon  dead-
ended at a water tower (for the nearby Satsop Center?). I  returned  to  the
washout and crossed it. Much to my surprise,  the  road  was  in  very  good
shape for hiking and in  fact  someone  had  done  a  fair  amount  of  work
brushing out the more overgrown sections. This was a good sign.  There  was,
however, little evidence of much recent use.

I easily followed the road about 3  miles,  past  another  washout,  a  nice
viewpoint at a corner and a switchback to the end of trail maintenance on  a
rib at 2800 ft. Here I found a large cairn and wooden arrow  pointing  to  a
steep path up the rib. This was an even better sign. It had to lead  to  the
lookout. But it was not a simple path and I am sure it is not  part  of  the
"old trail" but rather a "new route" put in by some  interested  party.   It
started well enough in the forest with a faint tread and a few  stray  flags
to guide the way, then got steeper and  steeper.  The  slick  frozen  ground
didn\'t help. Near the main ridge I ran into an  area  of  massive  blowdowns
with huge logs lying every which way.  A way  through  this  mess  was  well
flagged. It was not pretty or easy, what with crawling over and  under  logs
and in and out of debris, but it did  get  me  through  and  was  infinitely
better than being left to fend for myself.

I lost the flagging near the false summit, but since  I  was  now  past  the
horrible blowdowns I just headed straight up, still  with  the  preconceived
notion that the summit and lookout site were one in the same. As I  followed
the easy ridge to the true  summit  and  the  forest  refused  to  thin,  it
gradually dawned on me  they  were  not.  The  summit  was  a  disappointing
forested bump with zero views only of interest to a peakbagger.  I  realized
I had no idea where the lookout site was and I saw no  prospects  nearby.  I
might have explored around the area further, but this was  during  the  deep
freeze. It hovered near twenty all day with  stiff  breezes.   I  got  quite
cold during my brief lunch stop,  my  water  bottle  froze  solid,   it  was
getting late and I did not want to descend the tricky frozen ground or  find
my way through the blowdowns in the dark. So I gave up.  Despite  that,  the
last hour on the road was by headlamp anyway. (Total: 7 miles, 2900  ft  and
6:30 hrs)

Wednesday, December  11  -  And  so  I  returned  less  than  a  week  later
determined to find the lookout site. While home I studied the satellite  map
of the area and could see an open rocky area on  a  spur  ridge  SW  of  the
highest summit. This had to be where it was. It sure helps to know where  to
look.

I got an earlier start, drove directly to  the  first  washout  and  started
from there (1100 ft).  I  found  the  repeat  hike  up  the  road  downright
pleasant and reached the way trail cairn in 2 hours. I  didn\'t  know  it  at
the time but the lookout site is visible  from  this  spot.  Once  past  the
blowndowns where I had lost the route before, I carefully  looked  for  more
flags  in the direction I now knew I had to go - and found them.  The  route
traversed beneath the false summit west to a saddle. Here I  found  a  faint
trail, partially obscured by some debris, that went  down  slightly  on  the
other side to the base of the lookout crag. This crag is not visible at  all
from the forest until right upon it. And then there it  was  -  the  blasted
trail, the old iron posts for the hand cable, the foundation  of  the  cabin
and the views. It was a sunny and much  warmer  day  (above  freezing)  than
before and I spent a pleasant half hour on top (2450 ft, 3:30 hrs)

Just for completeness, I went back to the true summit (200 ft and  :30  from
LO). I then returned to the lookout again, since it was so  nice,  to  watch
the setting sun. I used up the remaining daylight working  on  the  trail  a
bit (I had brought a hand  saw  just  for  this  purpose)  and  adding  more
flagging.  I really feel this route could be  and  should  be  made  into  a
better trail. The lookout site deserves one. Meanwhile it is  accessible  to
anyone willing to tackle the rough way trail. For  those  into  old  lookout
sites it is well worth the effort.

Total: 7 miles 2900 ft and 8 hrs

Langille Pk (5372 ft - P252 - McCoy Pk Quad) - December 19, 2013

The closest approach to this peak is  from  the  northern  terminus  of  the
Langille Ridge Trail #259. However, I was  under  the  impression  that  the
access Road 2809 bridge over Yellowjacket Creek was still washed  out.  Both
the 2002 GT McCoy Peak map and the current  Gifford  Pinchot  NF  web  site,
which I read the day before leaving, confirmed this to be true.  Still  that
is the way I wanted to go so I went prepared to  ford  with  hip  waders  (I
couldn\'t handle wet feet in cold  water  this  time  of  year).  Imagine  my
surprise when I came to the crossing and found a new bridge in  place.  What
luck! My glee at not having to wade was quickly replaced with  despair  when
barely .6 mile up the road I came to a pickup blocking the road with a  sign
propped against it saying "tree felling ahead". I should have known  logging
and not hiker convenience was the reason the bridge was replaced.

I mulled over my options. I thought about going somewhere else but the  days
are so short I  didn\'t  have  the  time  and  I  really  wanted  this  peak.
Obviously they didn\'t want anyone in the area nor did I want to  be  smashed
by a falling tree. I could have driven around the pickup  but  didn\'t  think
that wise as it would be too obvious having a vehicle past the  sign  and  I
didn\'t know what I would run into farther  on.  However,  on  foot  I  could
probably sneak through if I was  alert  and  careful.  So  I  parked  a  few
hundred feet in front of the pickup (elev 2300 ft) and  started  walking.  I
could hear chainsaws and trees falling a ways below me but I met no one  and
saw no activity whatsoever on the road  itself.  The  area  of  concern  was
limited to near where the pickup was parked and I was quickly  beyond  that.
My annoyance at having to walk a perfectly  good  road  was  soon  muted  by
reaching the end of the drivable portion in a short .5 mile.  I  would  have
had to walk the majority of  the  road  anyway.  In  another  1.5  miles  of
pleasant walking I came to the old TH and the start of true  trail  at  2700
ft. The trail itself was in good  shape  and,  remarkably,  almost  snowfree
until I left it at 4700 ft (4.5 miles, 2400 ft. 3 hrs).

I was looking for the boot track mentioned in Dan Nelson\'s Day Hiking  South
Cascades. I naively thought this would lead to the summit as  that  was  the
implication. In hindsight and on closer rereading of  the  book,  I  do  not
believe Nelson was talking about the true summit but rather a rounded  knoll
some distance to the south. I really  should  have  realized  that.  Both  a
distant view of the peak  and  an  examination  of  map  contours  indicated
extensive cliffs and should have prepared me for no walkup ascent. At  least
I did think to take a rope.

In any event I came to what I thought was a boot  track  (probably  just  an
animal track) and started uphill. Almost immediately I  lost  all  signs  of
the track and ran into cliffs. I first tried to  turn  them  by  going  left
where I ran into a continuous wall I couldn\'t see any way  through.  Then  I
tried to the right and found a way  to  above  the  wall  but  then  had  to
traverse left a ways below upper cliffs until past those. I eventually  made
my way up to the main south ridge but could not follow  it  or  get  off  it
directly to easier terrain below due to more cliffs. I had to  backtrack  to
where I could descend into the basin below the ridge and  climb  up  to  the
left of it to the base of the summit rocks. All the while the  whole  summit
area was looking increasingly frightful. I saw no easy way up.  But  I  know
not to give up until rubbing noses with the rock. It often looks worse  from
a distance than it turns out to be.

And so it was. Once closer I could pick out a route through the cliffs.  The
hardest part was a class 4 pitch up an initial short vertical wall.  A  dead
tree leaning against the wall provided a few helpful  holds.  Above  that  a
class 3 ledge and gully led to a notch in the ridge. Actually  the  climbing
was fun, although it would have been more fun without the snow and  ice  and
cold and having to use gloves (temps were low 20\'s).  That  made  everything
seem more serious. On a warm summer day  this  would  be  a  very  enjoyable
climb. It was then an easy scramble along the ridge to the  summit  although
I did take care due to the exposure and snowy rock. I  reached  the  top  at
3:00 (5 miles, 3400 ft, 4:30). There was a cairn  but  no  register.  I  had
some good views; however Rainier  was  already  beginning  to  disappear  in
clouds due to an approaching front.

While not strictly necessary, I did rappel from the notch to the cliff  base
for fear of slipping on the snowy rock. I reached  the  trail  at  dusk  and
descended the rest of the way out by headlamp. All  day  long  I  had  heard
logging activity in the valley below. Often  it  was  quite  loud  with  the
sound of heavy equipment and trees falling and they kept at it right  up  to
the last daylight at  4:30.  I  just  hoped  my  car  was  still  there  and
unaffected. It was, but it was sobering to find a  half  dozen  large  trees
newly felled and still lying across the road just before I reached  it.  The
sign really meant what it said and I am glad I paid attention to it.  Had  I
driven around the pickup I might still be there.

Trip Total: 10 miles, 3550 ft and 8:30 hrs.

Wallace Peak (5760+ ft - P600 - Mowich Lk Quad) - January 1, 2014

I got a late start (even late by my standards) as I had to drop my  daughter
off at the airport before leaving home. I approached this peak the same  way
I did Tirzah  on November 14 but followed  abandoned  Road  7840  1.5  miles
farther (3.5 miles total) before dropping to Chenuis Creek.  This  was  just
before the creek that drains the SW side of East Bearhead  Mtn.  Once  again
Chenuis Creek gave me problems. I cast around for 30 minutes looking  for  a
good crossing without success. I finally just went for it on sketchy  rocks,
slipped and ended up with a wet foot but not  as  bad  as  on  Tirzah.  Once
across, the forest offered good travel and I  made  better  time.  Below  Pt
4855 at the edge of a snowy talus basin I encountered very icy terrain  that
required my microspikes to prevent slipping. Once on the crest of the  north
ridge travel improved until the final steep slope to the summit which  again
was very icy.  I reached the summit at 4:30 (3050 ft, 6  hrs)  where  I  was
shocked to find a register newly placed on December 28th and fresh  snowshoe
tracks made earlier on this same  day.  That  is  3  parties  (counting  me)
summiting this obscure Peak in 5 days. That new book on Rainier  Peaks  sure
is generating interest among peakbaggers. This was even 100/100 for some  of
them.  For me it was 98/100. I have no idea  what  approach  they  used.  My
guess is they biked the old closed road to the Carbon  River  TH,  took  the
higher bridge across the  Carbon  River  to  the  Northern  Loop  Trail  and
traversed from Chenuis Mtn. They certainly didn\'t come the way I did.

The return was slow  and  tedious  due  to  the  slick  icy  conditions  and
darkness. Even  with  microspikes  I  did  a  lot  of  slipping  as  I  have
discovered that, as good as they are for  trails,  they  don\'t  really  work
that well on steep sidehills since they don\'t fit tight enough. But then  my
aluminum crampons wouldn\'t be that  great  either  on  the  mixed  dirt  and
rocks. Maybe the tougher Katoolas with short steel spikes, no  front  points
and a more positive strap attachment would be the best  thing  to  use.  But
truth be told what is really needed is a deeper snow cover.  Hopefully  that
will soon come. However, my real  nemesis  was  Chenuis  Creek.  This  creek
definitely does not like me. I cannot stay dry while crossing it and on  the
return slipped for the fourth time (counting Tirzah).  This  time  I  really
slipped and fell completely in soaking both  feet,  both  gloved  hands  and
even much of my lower body. I was not happy as I once again sloshed  my  way
back to the car dripping wet.

Day Total: 11 miles, 3400 ft and 12:50 hrs

Tumwater Mtn (5240+ ft - P1040 - Cowlitz Falls Quad) and Vanson Peak  (4920+
ft - P520 - Vanson Pk Quad) - January 4-6, 2014

Saturday, January 4 - My original plan  was  to  climb  only  Vanson  Pk  by
driving Road 2600 to that TH.  However,  I  found  the  road  (which  is  on
private Champion Timber lands) gated shortly after the bridge  crossing  the
Cowlitz River. This was still some 13 miles from the TH  so  it  was  on  to
Plan B.  Nearby Road 2750 leading to  the  Goat  Creek  TH  was  not  gated.
Although much longer, I could still access Vanson Pk  from  this  trail.   I
might even be able to add  Tumwater  Mtn  to  the  itinerary.  Since  I  had
planned to backpack and had food for 2 nights I would have enough time.

I drove Road 2750 4 miles to its end at the TH and  was  surprised  to  find
two other cars. One couple was just starting out as  I  arrived.  The  trail
started on a short section of abandoned road that ended in .2  mile  at  the
old TH then entered gorgeous old growth forest. After about a mile I  caught
up to the couple who were stopped at an  overhanging  waterfall  by  an  icy
section of trail. Although short it was  pure  water  ice,  very  slick  and
along a  drop-off  where  a  slip  would  have  serious  consequences.  They
declined to continue. Even with micro spikes I found it tricky  enough  that
I chopped steps with my axe for better footholds. Fortunately  it  was  only
about 5 steps across to bare ground again.

The waterfall itself was quite interesting. Though not that  large  it  fell
in wispy sprays from high up on a massive  rounded  overhanging  cliff  with
the trail passing  behind  it  through  a  cave  like  grotto.   Beyond  the
waterfall the trail was etched into the hillside above the valley,  skirting
mossy cliffs, weaving in  and  out  of  lovely  side  creeks  and  gradually
dropping to gorgeous Goat Creek with its myriad cascades and  waterfalls.  I
had no idea this trail was  so  beautiful.  It  is  certainly  a  well  kept
secret. I thoroughly enjoyed hiking it.

At 2 miles I came to the junction with the  Tumwater  Trail  and  the  trail
that led to Vanson Pk.  I had hoped  to  camp  here  as  it  was  a  central
location for both my peaks, but I saw nothing suitable and had  to  continue
another .5 mile to the crossing of Goat creek where I  found  a  nice  level
spot on a gravel bar for my tent. By the time I  got  camp  set  up  it  was
3:00. I was now closer to Tumwater than Vanson so decided to  try  for  that
peak even though I knew I couldn\'t make the summit before  dark.  The  first
problem was crossing Goat Creek. All the creek  crossings  (and  there  were
several) on this trip were of some difficulty, not  because  of  high  water
but because of slick icy rocks. I made it across without getting  wet  feet.
I wasn\'t so lucky on the return in the dark.

I quickly gained elevation on the trail. The dense forest prevented much  in
the way of any views but there was one spot  on  a  rocky  outcrop  where  I
could look across to Vanson Pk and up the valley of Goat Creek. I  gradually
began running into some minor snow but it never amounted to more than a  few
inches. It was icy in spots yet not enough to require  micro  spikes.  After
about 3 miles I came to a snowy pond at 4800 ft. The map showed  two  closed
contour high points, both at 5240+ ft above this pond. I first went  to  the
east peak,  a  short  trek  from  the  trail,  which  turned  out  to  be  a
disappointing rounded bump with no views. I then followed the ridge  to  the
west peak which was a much nicer rocky summit which would certainly  have  a
good view. Unfortunately by the time I got there (6:00)  it  was  completely
dark and I saw nothing except the lights of Glenoma in the  Cowlitz  Valley.
I think this point is higher and I left my register here (3.5 m, 2700 ft,  3
hrs).

I now decided to continue west  along  the  ridge  to  intersect  the  trail
rather than returning east the way I had come.  It  looked  much  "shorter",
the ridge had been easy to this point and  the  map  did  not  indicate  any
obvious difficulties. This was not one of my better ideas.  Beware  of  what
can be hidden in 40 foot contours. I  unexpectedly  ran  into  a  series  of
small rocky steps and cliffs and steep  frozen  ground  that  gave  me  fits
finding a way down in the dark. I would have rappelled  but  I  hadn\'t  even
brought my panic rope. Since this trip was all on trail so why would I  ever
need a rope?  That would have held true had I stayed on the  "trail".  After
slithering down steep slopes, wandering back and forth  through  cliffs  and
lowering off branch belays I eventually hit the trail but it  took  over  an
hour. A "shortcut" it was not.

The rest of the trip out on trail  was  downright  pleasant  in  comparison-
until I came to the crossing of Goat Creek again. In the dark I misjudged  a
foot placement on a submerged rock and went in over the top of my boot.  But
hey, I only got one foot wet and I  was  right  at  camp  with  a  dry  sock
immediately available so it wasn\'t that bad.

Day Total; To Camp: 2.5 miles, 700 ft, 1:30 hrs. and RT to Tumwater  Mtn:  7
miles, 2850 ft, 5:40 hrs.

Sunday, January 5 - I returned to the trail junction and  headed  up  toward
Vanson Peak. This trip truly was all on trail and good trail  at  that,  the
first part through more gorgeous mossy forest.  Much  of  the  way  followed
alongside a little creek that had more waterfalls than its small size  might
first suggest. I ran into more snow on this northern exposure trail than  on
Tumwater but never enough to hinder progress and I followed  the  tracks  of
the occupants of the other car at the TH. They had gone all the way  to  the
summit. At 4.5 miles I  reached  the  south  ridge  of  Vanson  Pk  and  the
junction with the trail that came up the other side  from  Road  2600.  From
there it was half a mile farther to the open summit and expansive  views  (5
miles, 2600 ft, 3:45 hrs). I had lunch in the sun.

Back at the trail junction I went south another half mile  along  the  ridge
to a bump hoping for more views toward Mt St Helens but there were too  many
trees. I briefly considered continuing on to Deadmans Lake  and  picking  up
the Tumwater Trail there for a big loop back to camp but that  was  12  more
miles and I was feeling lazy so I turned around. As it was  by  the  time  I
got back to camp it was 5:00 and almost dark.  I could  have  gone  out  but
again I was feeling lazy, I didn\'t want to pack up and hike out in the  dark
and since I already had a  comfortable  camp  set  up  I  decided  to  spend
another night.  The days are just too  darn  short  this  time  of  year.  I
passed the long night getting caught up on videos of The Blacklist.

Day Total: 11 miles, 3250 ft and 7:30 hr.

Monday, January 6 - I was glad I had waited for daylight to  hike  out  this
beautiful section of trail and I enjoyed it just as much as  I  had  on  the
hike in.

Day Total: 2.5 miles, 400 ft and 1:30 hrs.

Trip        Total:        23        miles        and         7200         ft

Persindex (5360+ ft - P440 - Index Quad) - January 26, 2014

I had put off climbing this peak for years due to reports of horrible  brush
on the direct approach from the horseshoe curve on  Road  6220.  Nor  did  a
traverse from Persis appeal all  that  much.  Then  on  further  research  I
discovered a longer but less brushy route in  a  report  by  Justus  S  from
September 2006 where he used old roads on the west side for his  descent.  I
decided to try this route although I was uncertain how the roads  had  fared
in the intervening seven years and  what  it  would  be  like  under  winter
conditions. It turned out rather well, with one caveat.

I drove to the horseshoe curve at 2600 ft and parked. There was an  unlocked
gate here that vehicles had gone through. However, there was a washout  just
beyond. It was passable to a 4X4 but very rough, the road icy and  I  didn\'t
think it worth the risk so I walked. The road was  actually  still  drivable
for another .75 miles. It then gradually became  worse  and  more  overgrown
but was not really that bad and provided  a  good  way  through  the  valley
brush. After 2.5 miles I took a spur  road  left  that  led  to  a  4880  ft
saddle. The spur continued a short distance past the saddle to  end  on  the
north side below the extensive cliffs of Persindex\'s west ridge.

Up to this point what snow there was had been fairly soft but at  I  entered
the  shady  north  slope  it  turned  hard  and  crusty  and  crampons  were
necessary. I traversed the old clear-cut to cross a rib just below  a  tooth
like pinnacle. On the other side the terrain opened up onto  a  large  talus
bench. Fortunately most of the rocks were well covered with solid  snow  and
travel was relatively easy.  Although  I  occasionally  ran  into  breakable
crust, for the most part I stayed on top and never really needed  snowshoes,
which was a good thing as I had not brought them along.

So far things were going great. Then I entered the "obvious and easy"  gully
mentioned by Justus that provided access through the  cliffs  to  the  south
side.  Well, it may have been easy when bare  but  what  I  encountered  was
rock hard icy snow. Even with crampons the footing wasn\'t  that  secure  and
as the steepness increased near the notch at the top  I  had  to  resort  to
cutting steps to get up. In places I also had to search for a  spot  to  get
my axe pick all the way in. It was slow going and I probably lost  close  to
an hour here. To make matters even worse all the way  up  small  ice  pieces
were constantly falling from off  the  cliffs  on  either  side.  The  gully
itself was in perpetual shade. Not so with the upper cliffs. Nothing  really
big ever came down but it was unnerving all the same.  When  I  reached  the
notch I breathed a sigh of relief while still dreading the  descent  on  the
way back.

I entered welcome sunshine on the other side of  the  notch.  The  snow  was
softer yet still had a hard layer underneath so I kept  my  crampons  on.  I
descended slightly to bypass a cliff then climbed to a level bench  below  a
cliff band. I traversed this until I could cut up through the cliffs to  the
broad basin above which contained several frozen tarns.  Then  it  was  easy
slopes to the base of the summit tower and on to the top where I arrived  at
3:40 (3050 ft, 5:40 hrs).  Mindful of recent events I stayed well back  from
the cornice hanging over the steep east face.  I  looked  across  to  Middle
Index remembering the epic Franklin and I had shared on that peak  and  felt
his strong presence. I hoped his spirit would help get me down safely as  he
himself had done many times before.

I returned quickly to the notch where if anything descending the  gully  was
worse than climbing it. It went okay at first  backing  down  my  previously
chopped steps until I  reached  the  end  of  those  steps  and  still  felt
uncomfortable without them. So I had to chop new steps going down,  which  I
find very awkward to do. Thank heavens  for  my  Whippet  which  gave  me  a
handhold for my left hand while I chopped  with  my  right.  Eventually  the
angle lessened enough that I could just crampon  down  but  by  then  I  was
pretty fried. It had taken a lot of time under fading light  conditions  all
while  stuff  continued  coming  down  off  the  sides.  Under  better  snow
conditions it would not be that bad to climb this gully but  it  could  also
have great avalanche potential with dangerous slides  coming  off  the  side
walls. It reminded me of the Dry Creek Route gully on  Big  Four  but  on  a
smaller scale. No, I did not like this gully at all.

The rest of the way out was by headlamp but I didn\'t  mind.  I  rather  like
traveling at night if the terrain is reasonable. It was a beautiful  evening
perfect for reflecting on friends and family, present and past.

I reached the car at 8:30.

Total: 9 miles, 3250 ft and 10:32 hrs
