   Wild Dare Peak and Caroline Peak are unoficially named peaks that I
doubt are visited often.  Wild Dare Peak is the 5,311' peak near
Derrick Lake and the Wildcat Lakes on the Snoqualmie Pass quad.
Caroline Peak is the 5,885' peak that is south of Lake Caroline on the
Bandera quad.
   We'd start at the Snow Lake trailhead and hike for 7 miles to Lower
Wildcat Lake.  Probably camp by Lower Wildcat Lake since that's our
last source of water.  From the west end of Lower Wildcat Lake we'd
head north to the top of the ridge that runs between Wild Dare Peak
and Caroline Peak. There might be a difficult 120 vertical feet
between the lakes and the ridge at a spot that looks steep.  We'd have
about 5 miles of cross-country travel, mostly on ridges.
  About 19 miles round-trip and 6,000 feet of gain.

Tiger traverse (14 miles, c. 3800 ft gain) : from the backside, do all
tiger summits in this order.  S. Tiger (2028ft), Middle tiger
(2607ft), E. Tiger (3004ft), W. Tiger 1 (2948ft), W. Tiger 2 (2757ft),
W. Tiger 3 (2522ft).  Following various trails and roads.

Possibly combing trips 3 & 4 by taking two cars and leaving one at

about 1500ft gain).  You could also do 16 miles round trip, but doesn't
that sound exhausting?

<h3>Desert</h3>
Lindsay:<blockquote>
This is the local maximum I read a TR about that sounds like it could be a
friendly desert ski in the winter or a very pretty overnighter in March or
April to see the wildflowers and admire the views.

The place called Ozone, off highway 14 outside of Vancouver mile
marker 23 park accross the street from the giant billboard, I can't
even find it in here, but It is by FAR the best climbing in the
Area... (huge cracked ceilings, nice unpolished rock, well protected
routes, nice exposure) it's like a legal madrone.
